factor you should carefully consider the following risk factor in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form each of these risk factor could adversely affect our business operating result and financial condition well adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock our operating result our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our asset are exposed to the effect of changing commodity price price for crude oil bitumen natural gas natural gas liquid and lng can fluctuate widely globally price for crude oil bitumen natural gas natural gas liquid and lng have recently experienced significant decline from their historic level during and with continued global production increase that have outpaced demand growth leading to large observed rise in global inventory price for brent crude oil wti crude oil henry hub natural gas and natural gas liquid in the fourth quarter of have all declined more than percent compared with price in the fourth quarter of and there are no indication the price decline will reverse in the immediate future our revenue operating result and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the price we receive for our crude oil bitumen natural gas natural gas liquid and lng the factor influencing these price are beyond our control lower crude oil bitumen natural gas natural gas liquid and lng price may have material adverse effect on our revenue operating income cash flow and liquidity and on the amount of dividend we elect to declare and pay on our common stock lower price may also limit the amount of reserve we can produce economically adversely affecting our ability to maintain our reserve replacement ratio and accelerating the reduction in our existing reserve level we continue production from upstream field significant reduction in crude oil bitumen natural gas natural gas liquid and lng price could also require to reduce our capital expenditure or impair the carrying value of our asset during we recognized several impairment which are described in note impairment in the note to consolidated financial statement if commodity price remain low relative to their historic level and we continue to optimize our investment and exercise capital flexibility it is reasonably likely we will incur future impairment to long lived asset used in operation investment in nonconsolidated entity accounted for under the equity method and unproved property although it is not reasonably practicable to quantify the impact of any future impairment at this time our result of operation could be adversely affected result our ability to declare and pay dividend is subject to certain consideration dividend are authorized and determined by our board of director in it sole discretion and depend upon number of factor including cash available for distribution our result of operation and anticipated future result of operation our financial condition especially in relation to the anticipated future capital need of our property the level of reserve we establish for future capital expenditure the level of distribution paid by comparable company our operating expense other factor our board of director deems relevant we expect to continue to pay quarterly distribution to our stockholder however we bear all expense incurred by our operation and our fund generated by operation after deducting these expense may not be sufficient to cover desired level of distribution to our stockholder any downward revision in our distribution could have material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock table of content we may need additional capital in the future and it may not be available on acceptable term we have historically relied primarily upon cash generated by our operation to fund our operation and strategy however we have also relied from time to time on access to the debt and equity capital market for funding there can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available in the future on acceptable term or at all our ability to obtain additional financing will be subject to number of factor including market condition our operating performance investor sentiment and our ability to incur additional debt in compliance with agreement governing our then outstanding debt if we are unable to generate sufficient fund from operation or raise additional capital our growth could be impeded in addition we are regularly evaluated by the major rating agency based on number of factor including our financial strength and condition affecting the oil and gas industry generally due to the significant recent decline in price for crude oil bitumen natural gas natural gas liquid and lng and the expectation that these price could remain depressed in the near future the major rating agency have indicated will be conducting review of the oil and gas industry and the debt rating for some company operating in the industry may be downgraded the result of these action including any downgrade in our credit rating could increase the cost associated with any additional indebtedness we incur our business may be adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality of or default under our contract with third party with we do business the operation of our business requires to engage in transaction with numerous counterparties operating in variety of industry including other company operating in the oil and gas industry these counterparties may default on their obligation to result of operational failure or lack of liquidity or for other reason including bankruptcy market speculation about the credit quality of these counterparties or their ability to continue performing on their existing obligation may also exacerbate any operational difficulty or liquidity issue they are experiencing particularly it relates to other company in the oil and gas industry result of the recent significant decline in commodity price any default by any of our counterparties may result in our inability to perform obligation under agreement we have made with third party or may otherwise adversely affect our business or result of operation in addition our right against any of our counterparties result of default may not be adequate to compensate for the resulting harm caused or may not be enforceable at all in some circumstance unless we successfully add to our existing proved reserve our future crude oil bitumen natural gas and natural gas liquid production will decline resulting in an adverse impact to our business the rate of production from upstream field generally decline reserve are depleted except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration and development activity or through engineering study optimize production performance or identify additional or secondary recovery reserve our proved reserve will decline materially we produce crude oil bitumen natural gas and natural gas liquid accordingly to the extent we are unsuccessful in replacing the crude oil bitumen natural gas and natural gas liquid we produce with good prospect for future production our business will experience reduced cash flow and result of operation any cash conservation effort we may undertake result of commodity price decline may further limit our ability to replace depleted reserve any material change in the factor and assumption underlying our estimate of crude oil bitumen natural gas and natural gas liquid reserve could impair the quantity and value of those reserve our proved reserve information included in this annual report ha been derived from engineering estimate prepared by our personnel reserve estimation is process that involves estimating volume to be recovered from underground accumulation of crude oil bitumen natural gas and natural gas liquid that can not be directly measured result different petroleum engineer each using industry accepted geologic and engineering practice and scientific method may produce different estimate of reserve and future net cash flow based on the available data any significant future price change could have material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved reserve any material change in the factor and assumption table of content underlying our estimate of these item could result in material negative impact to the volume of reserve reported or could cause to incur impairment expense on property associated with the production of those reserve future reserve revision could also result from change in among other thing governmental regulation in addition to change in the quantity and value of our proved reserve the amount of crude oil bitumen natural gas and natural gas liquid that can be obtained from any proved reserve may ultimately be different from those estimated prior to extraction we expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditure and operating cost result of our compliance with existing and future environmental law and regulation likewise future environmental law and regulation such limitation on greenhouse gas emission may impact or limit our current business plan and reduce demand for our product our business are subject to numerous law and regulation relating to the protection of the environment these law and regulation continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our operation with respect to among other thing the discharge of pollutant into the environment emission into the atmosphere such nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide mercury and greenhouse gas emission carbon tax the handling use storage transportation disposal and cleanup of hazardous material and hazardous and nonhazardous waste the dismantlement abandonment and restoration of our property and facility at the end of their useful life exploration and production activity in certain area such offshore environment arctic field oil sand reservoir and tight oil play we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital operating and maintenance and remediation expenditure result of these law and regulation to the extent these expenditure with all cost are not ultimately reflected in the price of our product and service our business financial condition result of operation and cash flow in future period could be materially adversely affected although our business operation are designed and operated to accommodate expected climatic condition to the extent there are significant change in the earth climate such more severe or frequent weather condition in the market we serve or the area where our asset reside we could incur increased expense our operation could be materially impacted and demand for our product could fall demand for our product may also be adversely affected by conservation plan and effort undertaken in response to global climate change including plan developed in connection with the recent paris climate conference in december many government also provide or may in the future provide tax advantage and other subsidy to support the use and development of alternative energy technology our operation and the demand for our product could be materially impacted by the development and adoption of these technology domestic and worldwide political and economic development could damage our operation and materially reduce our profitability and cash flow action of the state local and foreign government through tax and other legislation executive order and commercial restriction could reduce our operating profitability both in the united state and abroad in certain location government have imposed or proposed restriction on our operation special tax or tax assessment and payment transparency regulation that could require to disclose competitively sensitive information or might cause to violate non disclosure law of other country federal state and local legislative and regulatory agency initiative regarding the hydraulic fracturing process could result in operating restriction or delay in the completion of our oil and gas well table of content the government can also prevent or restrict from business in foreign country these restriction and those of foreign government have in the past limited our ability to operate in or gain access to opportunity in various country action by host government have affected operation significantly in the past such the expropriation of our oil asset by the venezuelan government and may continue to do so in the future change in domestic and international regulation may affect our ability to obtain or maintain permit including those necessary for drilling and development of well or for construction of lng terminal or regasification facility in various location local political and economic factor in international market could have material adverse effect on approximately percent of our hydrocarbon production from continuing operation wa derived from production outside the united state in and percent of our proved reserve of december wa located outside the united state we are subject to risk associated with operation in international market including change in foreign governmental policy relating to crude oil natural gas bitumen natural gas liquid or lng pricing and taxation other political economic or diplomatic development changing political condition and international monetary fluctuation in particular some country where we operate lack well developed legal system or have not adopted clear legal and regulatory framework for oil and gas exploration and production this lack of legal certainty expose our operation to increased risk including increased difficulty in enforcing our agreement in those jurisdiction and increased risk of adverse action by local government authority such expropriation change in governmental regulation may impose price control and limitation on production of crude oil bitumen natural gas and natural gas liquid our operation are subject to extensive governmental regulation from time to time regulatory agency have imposed price control and limitation on production by restricting the rate of flow of crude oil bitumen natural gas and natural gas liquid well below actual production capacity legal requirement are frequently changed and subject to interpretation we can not predict the effect of these requirement our investment in joint venture decrease our ability to manage risk we conduct many of our operation through joint venture in which we may share control with our joint venture partner there is risk our joint venture participant may at any time have economic business or legal interest or goal that are inconsistent with those of the joint venture or or our joint venture partner may be unable to meet their economic or other obligation and we may be required to fulfill those obligation alone failure by or an entity in which we have joint venture interest to adequately manage the risk associated with any acquisition or joint venture could have material adverse effect on the financial condition or result of operation of our joint venture and in turn our business and operation we do not insure against all potential loss therefore we could be harmed by unexpected liability and increased cost we maintain insurance against many not all potential loss or liability arising from operating risk such our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover against potential loss arising from such risk uninsured loss and liability arising from operating risk

asset in canada lower risk legacy asset in north america europe asia and australia several major international development and an inventory of global conventional and unconventional exploration prospect the energy landscape changed dramatically in the past year increased supply caused commodity price to decline substantially in december we announced operating plan based on billion of capital expenditure this represented reduction of percent compared to actual expenditure sourced from the completion of several major project well deferral deflation capture and efficiency across the portfolio table of content in response to an outlook of lower price in compared to well credit tightening across the industry we revised our operating plan in february reducing our capital expenditure guidance by percent from billion to billion we also reduced our quarterly dividend by percent to per share these action taken to maintain strong balance sheet will enable to continue to deliver an investment offering of competitive dividend disciplined growth and financial strength we also believe these action position the company for success in lower more volatile price environment with the flexibility to adjust to commodity price movement in the future key operating and financial summary significant item during included the following achieved full year production of mboed percent production growth from continuing operation adjusted for libya downtime and disposition lowered operating cost year over year reduced capital by percent compared with achieved major project startup at aplng and surmont completed additional startup at eldfisk ii drill site enochdhu and the brodgar subsea tie back announced phased exit from deepwater exploration completed approximately billion of non core asset disposition across the portfolio ended the year with billion of cash and cash equivalent we accomplished several strategic milestone in excluding libya our production from continuing operation wa mboed compared with mboed in mboed increase the production increase wa driven by growth from major project and development program well improved well performance partially offset by normal field decline in we generated billion from the disposition of certain non core asset in our portfolio the full year production impact of completed disposition wa mboed in we reviewed our cost structure and took decisive action to achieve sustainable operating cost reduction across the company we targeted billion reduction in operating cost in compared with we reduced headcount including management position to streamline decision making increased the autonomy in our business unit captured deflation and adjusted our activity level which resulted in achieving our stated target in year ahead of schedule operating cost include production and operating expense selling general and administrative expense and exploration expense excluding dry hole and leasehold impairment expense we generated billion in cash from continuing operation in paid dividend on our common stock of billion and ended the year with billion in cash and cash equivalent business environment in the first half of strong crude oil price were supported by geopolitical tension impacting supply well global oil demand growth this wa followed by an abrupt decline in price during the fourth quarter of surging production growth from tight oil and the decision by the organization of petroleum exporting country opec to maintain production outweighed fear of supply disruption these development combined with slowing global oil demand growth caused crude oil price to plummet to near five year low at the end of price remained significantly lower throughout reaching ten year quarterly low of for brent crude oil in the fourth quarter of lower price contributed to higher demand growth which wa overwhelmed by continued production increase and supply surplus brent crude oil wa in january reflecting an ongoing decline in price table of content the energy industry ha periodically experienced this type of extreme volatility due to fluctuating supply and demand condition commodity price are the most significant factor impacting our profitability and related reinvestment of operating cash flow into our business among other dynamic that could influence world energy market and commodity price are global economic health supply disruption or fear thereof caused by civil unrest or military conflict action taken by opec environmental law tax regulation governmental policy and weather related disruption north america energy landscape ha been transformed from resource scarcity to an abundance of supply primarily due to advance in technology responsible for the rapid growth of tight oil production successful exploration and rising production from the canadian oil sand our strategy is to sustainably lower our cost structure and maintain strong balance sheet and diverse low cost of supply portfolio that can provide the financial flexibility to withstand challenging business cycle operating and financial priority other important factor we must continue to manage well in order to be successful include maintaining relentless focus on safety and environmental stewardship safety and environmental stewardship including the operating integrity of our asset remain our highest priority and we are committed to protecting the health and safety of everyone ha role in our operation and the community in which we operate we strive to conduct our business with respect and care for both the local and global environment and systematically manage risk to drive sustainable business growth our sustainability effort in focused on updating action plan for climate change biodiversity water and human right well revamping public reporting to be more informative searchable and responsive to common question we are committed to building learning organization using human performance principle we relentlessly pursue improved health safety and environment hse and operational performance we are founding member of the marine well containment company llc mwcc non profit organization formed in to improve industry spill response in the gulf of mexico mwcc developed containment system which meet the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement requirement for subsea well containment system that can respond to deepwater well control incident in the gulf of mexico to complement this work internationally we and several leading oil and gas company established the subsea well response project in norway which enhances the oil industry ability to respond to subsea well control incident in international water exercising our capital flexibility we participate in commodity price driven and capital intensive industry with varying lead time from when an investment decision is made to the time an asset is operational and generates cash flow result we must invest significant capital dollar to explore for new oil and gas field develop newly discovered field maintain existing field and construct pipeline and liquefied natural gas lng facility given our view of greater price volatility we see benefit in having an inventory of value preserving shorter cycle time and low cost of supply opportunity in our resource base in response to weakening commodity price we have slowed the pace of certain discretionary investment including the eagle ford and the bakken well emerging unconventional play in the permian niobrara and montney and plan to fund additional cash call in our equity affiliate we retain the flexibility to increase or decrease investment activity without loss of opportunity and will reassess our near term investment decision necessary we use disciplined approach focused on value maximization to set our capital plan in february we announced revised capital budget of billion for reduction of percent compared with actual capital expenditure of billion in the billion reduction primarily reflects lower spending on major project deferral of activity primarily in the lower deflation capture and efficiency across the portfolio table of content portfolio optimization we continue to optimize our asset portfolio by focusing on low cost of supply asset which strategically fit our development plan in the third quarter of we announced plan to reduce future capital spending in our deepwater exploration program result we terminated our gulf of mexico deepwater drillship contract with ensco and impaired certain gulf of mexico lease where we decided not to conduct further activity additionally in the fourth quarter of we recorded dry hole expense and impaired additional lease in the canada segment due to streamlined capital plan in we generated approximately billion in proceeds from non core asset disposition including the sale of certain western canadian property producing property in east texas and north louisiana producing property in south texas certain pipeline and gathering asset in south texas and our percent equity method investment in the russian joint venture polar light company we will continue to evaluate our asset to determine whether they fit our strategic direction and will optimize the portfolio necessary directing our capital investment to area that align with our objective controlling cost and expense controlling operating and overhead cost without compromising safety and environmental stewardship is high priority we monitor these cost using various methodology that are reported to senior management monthly on both an absolute dollar basis and per unit basis managing operating and overhead cost is critical to maintaining competitive position in our industry particularly in low commodity price environment adding to our proved reserve base we primarily add to our proved reserve base in three way successful exploration exploitation and development of new and existing field application of new technology and process to improve recovery from existing field acquisition of existing field proved reserve estimate require economic production based on historical month first of month average price and current cost therefore our proved reserve generally decrease price decline and increase price rise additionally we undertake cash conservation effort our reserve replacement effort could be delayed thus limiting our ability to replace depleted reserve low commodity price and reduced capital expenditure in adversely affected our reported year end proved reserve in our organic reserve replacement excluding the impact of sale and purchase wa percent in the five year ended december our organic reserve replacement wa percent excluding the impact of sale and purchase access to additional resource ha become increasingly difficult commodity price can make project uneconomic or unattractive in addition prohibition of direct investment in some nation national fiscal term political instability competition from national oil company and lack of access to high potential area due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base such the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may or may not allow to replace our production over subsequent year applying technical capability we leverage our knowledge and technology to create value and safely deliver on our plan technical strength is part of our heritage and we are evolving our technical approach to optimally apply best practice companywide we continue to evaluate potential solution to leverage knowledge of technological success across all of our operation such innovation enable to economically convert additional resource to reserve achieve greater operating efficiency and reduce our environmental impact developing and retaining talented work force we strive to attract train develop and retain individual with the knowledge and skill to implement our business strategy and who support our value and ethic to this end we offer university internship across multiple discipline to attract the table of content best talent and needed recruit experienced hire to maintain broad range of skill and experience we promote continued learning development and technical training through structured development program designed to enhance the technical and functional skill of our employee other significant factor that can affect our profitability include commodity price our earnings and operating cash flow generally correlate with industry price level for crude oil and natural gas the price of which are subject to factor external to the company and over which we have no control the following graph depicts the average benchmark price for west texas intermediate wti crude oil dated brent crude oil and henry hub natural gas crude oil price have remained under pressure throughout due to continued global production increase that ha outpaced demand growth leading to large observed rise in global inventory brent crude oil price averaged per barrel in the fourth quarter of decrease of percent compared with per barrel in the fourth

unit mmbtu in the fourth quarter of decrease of percent compared with per mmbtu in the fourth quarter of natural gas price remained under pressure production growth continued and underground gas storage inventory rose to the top of the five year range in late natural gas liquid price were also lower in our realized natural gas liquid price averaged per barrel in the fourth quarter of decrease of percent compared with per barrel in the same quarter of the expansion in tight oil production ha also helped boost supply of natural gas liquid resulting in continued downward pressure on natural gas liquid price in the united state declining global crude oil price have resulted in the western canada select benchmark price experiencing percent decline from per barrel in to per barrel in consequently our realized bitumen price experienced decrease relative to price level our realized bitumen price wa per barrel in decrease of percent compared with in the same period of table of content our total average realized price from continuing operation wa per barrel of oil equivalent boe in decrease of percent compared with per boe in our total average realized price wa per boe in the fourth quarter of decrease of percent compared with per boe in the fourth quarter of the reduction in the price reflects lower average realized price across all commodity in recent year the use of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling in tight oil formation ha led to increased industry actual and forecasted crude oil and natural gas production in the united state although providing significant short and long term growth opportunity for our company the increased abundance of crude oil and natural gas due to development of tight oil play could also have adverse financial implication to including an extended period of low commodity price production curtailment delay of plan to develop area such unconventional field or alaska north slope natural gas field and underutilization of lng regasification facility should one or more of these event occur our revenue would be reduced and additional asset impairment might be possible going forward domestic crude price should reach market equilibrium with global crude price due to the recent overturn of the crude export ban impairment mentioned above we participate in capital intensive industry at time our property plant and equipment and investment become impaired when for example commodity price decline significantly for long period of time our reserve estimate are revised downward or decision to dispose of an asset lead to write down to it fair value we may also invest large amount of money in exploration which if exploratory drilling prof unsuccessful could lead to material impairment of leasehold value in we recorded pre tax impairment of billion for proved property and an equity method investment and billion for unproved property compared with million and million in for additional information on our impairment in and see note impairment in the note to consolidated financial statement effective tax rate our operation are located in country with different tax rate and fiscal structure accordingly even in stable commodity price and fiscal regulatory environment our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly between period based on the mix of pretax earnings within our global operation fiscal and regulatory environment our operation can be affected by changing economic regulatory and political environment in the various country in which we operate including the united state civil unrest or strained relationship with government may impact our operation or investment these changing environment have generally negatively impacted our result of operation and further change to government fiscal take could have negative impact on future operation our production operation in libya and related oil export have been suspended or significantly curtailed since july due to the closure of the sider crude oil export terminal and they were also suspended in during libya period of civil unrest in the united kingdom government enacted tax legislation which reduced our corporate tax rate by percent while the alberta provincial government enacted legislation increasing our overall canadian corporate tax rate by percent our asset in venezuela and ecuador were expropriated in and respectively our management carefully considers these event when evaluating project or determining the level of activity in such country table of content outlook consistent

of completed disposition first quarter production from continuing operation is expected to be mboed to mboed marketing activity in line with our objective to continuously optimize our portfolio we are currently marketing certain non core asset we expect to generate up to billion in proceeds annually from asset sale impairment result of lower commodity price and we optimize our investment and exercise capital flexibility it is reasonably likely we may incur future impairment charge to long lived asset used in operation investment in nonconsolidated entity accounted for under the equity

regulation other company in our industry the most significant of these environmental law and regulation include among others the federal clean air act which governs air emission federal clean water act which governs discharge to water body european union regulation for registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemical reach federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla which imposes liability on generator transporter and arranger of hazardous substance at site where hazardous substance release have occurred or are threatening to occur federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra which governs the treatment storage and disposal of solid waste federal oil pollution act of under which owner and operator of onshore facility and pipeline lessee or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located and owner and operator of vessel are liable for removal cost and damage that result from discharge of oil into navigable water of the united state federal emergency planning and community right to know act epcra which requires facility to report toxic chemical inventory with local emergency planning committee and response department federal safe drinking water act which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection well department of the interior regulation which relate to offshore oil and gas operation in water and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operation well potential liability for pollution damage european union trading directive resulting in european emission trading scheme these law and their implementing regulation set limit on emission and in the case of discharge to water establish water quality limit they also in most case require permit in association with new or modified operation these permit can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the table of content application process which can be expensive and time consuming in addition there can be delay associated with notice and comment period and the agency processing of the application many of the delay associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant many state and foreign country where we operate also have or are developing similar environmental law and regulation governing these same type of activity while similar in some case these regulation may impose additional or more stringent requirement that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting product across state and international border the ultimate financial impact arising from environmental law and regulation is neither clearly known nor easily determinable new standard such air emission standard water quality standard and stricter fuel regulation continue to evolve however environmental law and regulation including those that may arise to address concern about global climate change are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operation in the united state and in other country in which we operate notable area of potential impact include air emission compliance and remediation obligation in the united state and canada an example is the use of hydraulic fracturing an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formation range of local state federal or national law and regulation currently govern hydraulic fracturing operation with hydraulic fracturing currently prohibited in some jurisdiction although hydraulic fracturing ha been conducted for many decade number of new law regulation and permitting requirement are under consideration by the environmental protection agency epa the department of the interior and others which could result in increased cost operating restriction operational delay and or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resource governmental restriction on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall profitability or viability of certain of our oil and natural gas investment we have adopted operating principle that incorporate established industry standard designed to meet or exceed government requirement our practice continually evolve technology improves and regulation change we also are subject to certain law and regulation relating to environmental remediation obligation associated with current and past operation such law and regulation include cercla and rcra and their state equivalent longer term expenditure are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly we occasionally receive request for information or notice of potential liability from the epa and state environmental agency alleging we are potentially responsible party under cercla or an equivalent state statute on occasion we also have been made party to cost recovery litigation by those agency or by private party these request notice and lawsuit assert potential liability for remediation cost at various site that typically are not owned by but allegedly contain waste attributable to our past operation of december there were site around the united state in which we were identified potentially responsible party under cercla and comparable state law for most superfund site our potential liability will be significantly le than the total site remediation cost because the percentage of waste attributable to versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible party is relatively low although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal site and frequently so for state site other potentially responsible party at site where we are party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligation and where they have not or where potentially responsible party could not be located our share of liability ha not increased materially many of the site at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the epa or the state agency concerned prior to actual cleanup those potentially responsible normally ass site condition apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation in some instance we may have no liability or attain settlement of liability actual cleanup cost generally occur after the party obtain epa or equivalent state agency approval there are relatively site where we are major participant and given the timing and amount of anticipated expenditure neither the cost of remediation at those site nor such cost at all cercla site in the aggregate is expected to have material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition table of content expensed environmental cost were million in and are expected to be about million per year in and capitalized environmental cost were million in and are expected to be about million per year in and accrued liability for remediation activity are not reduced for potential recovery from insurer or other third party and are not discounted except those assumed in purchase business combination which we do record on discounted basis many of these liability result from cercla rcra and similar state or international law that require to undertake certain investigative and remedial activity at site where we conduct or conducted operation or at site where conocophillips generated waste wa disposed the accrual also includes number of site we identified that may require environmental remediation but which are not currently the subject of cercla rcra or other agency enforcement activity if applicable we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third party recovery in the future we may incur significant cost under both cercla and rcra remediation activity vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site depending on the mix of unique site characteristic evolving remediation technology diverse regulatory agency and enforcement policy and the presence or absence of potentially liable third party therefore it is difficult to develop reasonable estimate of future site remediation cost at december our balance sheet included total accrued environmental cost of million compared with million at december for remediation activity in the canada and the we expect to incur substantial amount of these expenditure within the next year notwithstanding any of the foregoing and with other company engaged in similar business environmental cost and liability are inherent concern in our operation and product and there can be no assurance that material cost and liability will not be incurred however we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our result of operation or financial position result of compliance with current environmental law and regulation climate change there ha been broad range of proposed or promulgated state national and international law focusing on greenhouse gas ghg reduction these proposed or promulgated law apply or could apply in country where we have interest or may have interest in the future law in this field continue to evolve and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either timetable for implementation or our future compliance cost relating to implementation such law if enacted could have material impact on our result of operation and financial condition example of legislation or precursor for possible regulation that do or could affect our operation include european emission trading

approximately million net share pre tax the agreement reached in paris in december at the conference of the party to the united nation framework on climate change setting new process for achieving global emission reduction in the united state some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal and state level with respect to ghg emission such regulation could take any of several form that may result in the creation of additional cost in the form of tax the restriction of output investment of capital to maintain compliance with law and regulation or required acquisition or trading of emission allowance we are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operation compliance with change in law and regulation that create ghg emission trading scheme or ghg reduction policy could significantly increase our cost reduce demand for fossil energy derived product impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation such law and regulation could also increase demand for le carbon intensive energy source including natural gas the ultimate impact on our financial performance either positive or negative will depend on number of factor including but not limited to whether and to extent legislation or regulation is enacted the timing of the introduction of such legislation or regulation the nature of the legislation such cap and trade system or tax on emission or regulation the price placed on ghg emission either by the market or through tax the ghg reduction required the price and availability of offset the amount and allocation of allowance technological and scientific development leading to new product or service any potential

emission in the range of to per tonne depending on the timing and country or region to evaluate future opportunity other we have deferred tax asset related to certain accrued liability loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards valuation allowance have been established to reduce these deferred tax asset to an amount that will more likely than not be realized based on our historical taxable income our expectation for the future and available tax planning strategy management expects the net deferred tax asset will be realized offset to reversing deferred tax liability and offset to the tax consequence of future taxable income table of content critical accounting estimate the preparation of financial statement in conformity with generally accepted accounting principle requires management to select appropriate accounting policy and to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense see note accounting policy in the note to consolidated financial statement for description of our major accounting policy certain of these accounting policy involve judgment and uncertainty to such an extent there is reasonable likelihood materially different amount would have been reported under different condition or if different assumption had been used these critical accounting estimate are discussed with the audit and finance committee of the board of director at least annually we believe the following discussion of critical accounting estimate along with the discussion of contingency and of deferred tax asset valuation allowance in this report address all important accounting area where the nature of accounting estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matter or the susceptibility of such matter to change oil and gas accounting accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rule unique to the oil and gas industry the acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information prior to the discovery of proved reserve is expensed incurred similar to accounting for research and development cost however leasehold acquisition cost and exploratory well cost are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserve have been discovered on the prospect property acquisition cost for individually significant leasehold management periodically ass for impairment based on exploration and drilling effort to date for relatively small individual leasehold acquisition cost management exercise judgment and determines percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserve and pool that leasehold information with others in the geographic area for prospect in area with limited or no previous exploratory drilling the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high this judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense this judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leasehold and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively at year end the book value of the pool of property acquisition cost that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above described periodic leasehold impairment calculation wa million and the accumulated impairment reserve wa million the weighted average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure wa approximately percent and the weighted average amortization period wa approximately three year if that judgmental percentage were to be raised by percent across all calculation pre tax leasehold impairment expense in would increase by approximately million at year end the remaining million of net capitalized unproved property cost consisted primarily of individually significant leasehold mineral right held in perpetuity by title ownership exploratory well currently being drilled suspended exploratory well and capitalized interest of this amount approximately billion is concentrated in major development area the majority of which are not expected to move to proved property in management periodically ass individually significant leasehold for impairment based on the result of exploration and drilling effort and the outlook for commercialization exploratory cost for exploratory well drilling cost are temporarily capitalized or suspended on the balance sheet pending determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserve have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify completion of the find producing well table of content if exploratory well encounter potentially economic quantity of oil and gas the well cost remain capitalized on the balance sheet long sufficient progress assessing the reserve and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made the accounting notion of sufficient progress is judgmental area but the accounting rule do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well cost on the expectation future market condition will improve or new technology will be found that would make the development economically profitable often the ability to move into the development phase and record proved reserve is dependent on obtaining permit and government or co venturer approval the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control exploratory well cost remain suspended long we are actively pursuing such approval and permit and believe they will be obtained once all required approval and permit have been obtained the project are moved into the development phase and the oil and gas reserve are designated proved reserve for complex exploratory discovery it is not unusual to have exploratory well remain suspended on the balance sheet for several year while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co venturer approval of development plan or seek environmental permitting once determination is made the well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantity the well cost are expensed dry hole and reported in exploration expense management review suspended well balance quarterly continuously monitor the result of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work and expense the suspended well cost dry hole when it determines the potential field doe not warrant further investment in the near term criterion utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristic and hydrocarbon property expected development cost ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserve fiscal term regulation or contract negotiation and our expected return on investment at year end total suspended well cost were million compared with million at year end for additional information on suspended well including an aging analysis see note suspended well and other exploration expense in the note to consolidated financial statement proved reserve engineering estimate of the quantity of proved reserve are inherently imprecise and represent approximate amount because of the judgment involved in developing such information reserve estimate are based on geological and engineering assessment of in place hydrocarbon volume the production plan historical extraction recovery and processing yield factor installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limit the reliability of these estimate at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbon despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimate accounting rule require disclosure of proved reserve estimate due to the importance of these estimate to better understand the perceived value and future cash flow of company operation there are several authoritative guideline regarding the engineering criterion that must be met before estimated reserve can be designated proved our geosciences and reservoir engineering organization ha policy and procedure in place consistent with these authoritative guideline we have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserve held by consolidated company well our share of equity affiliate proved reserve estimate are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant change occur and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field also required by current authoritative guideline the estimated future date when an asset will be permanently shut down for economic reason is based on month average price and current cost this estimated date when production will end affect the amount of estimated reserve therefore price and cost level change from year to year the estimate of proved reserve also change generally our proved reserve decrease price decline and increase price rise table of content our proved reserve include estimated quantity related to production sharing contract reported under the economic interest method well variable royalty regime and are subject to fluctuation in commodity price recoverable operating expense and capital cost if cost remain stable reserve quantity attributable to recovery of cost will change inversely to change in commodity price we would expect reserve from these contract to decrease when product price rise and increase when price decline the estimation of proved developed reserve also is important to the income statement because the proved developed reserve estimate for field serf the denominator in the unit of production calculation of the dd of the capitalized cost for that asset at year end the net book value of productive property plant and equipment pp subject to unit of production calculation wa approximately billion and the dd recorded on these asset in wa approximately billion the estimated proved developed reserve for our consolidated operation were billion boe at the end of and billion boe at the end of if the estimate of proved reserve used in the unit of production calculation had been lower by percent across all calculation pre tax dd in would have increased by an estimated million impairment long lived asset used in operation are assessed for impairment whenever change in fact and circumstance indicate possible significant deterioration in future cash flow expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following update to corporate planning assumption if there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered the asset is monitored by management through an established process where change to significant assumption such price volume and future development plan are reviewed if upon review the sum of the undiscounted pre tax cash flow is le than the carrying value of the asset group the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value individual asset are grouped for impairment purpose based on judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flow that are largely independent of the cash flow of other group of asset generally on field by field basis for exploration and production asset because there usually is lack of quoted market price for long lived asset the fair value of impaired asset is typically determined based on the present value of expected future cash flow using discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participant or based on multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transaction of similar asset where possible the expected future cash flow used for impairment review and related fair value calculation are based on judgmental assessment of future production volume commodity price operating cost and capital decision considering all available information at the date of review differing assumption could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment in any period see note impairment in the note to consolidated financial statement for additional information investment in nonconsolidated entity accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence of loss in value and annually following update to corporate planning assumption such evidence of loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount or current fair value le than the investment carrying amount when it is determined such loss in value is other than temporary an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment carrying value and it estimated fair value when determining whether decline in value is other than temporary management considers factor such the length of time and extent of the decline the investee financial condition and near term prospect and our ability and intention to retain our investment for period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment since quoted market price are usually not available the fair value is typically based on the present value of expected future cash flow using discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participant plus market analysis of comparable asset owned by the investee if appropriate differing assumption could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period table of content asset retirement obligation and environmental cost under various contract permit and regulation we have material legal obligation to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operation at operational site our largest asset removal obligation involve plugging and abandonment of well removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platform around the world well oil and gas production facility and pipeline in alaska the fair value of obligation for dismantling and removing these facility are recorded liability and an increase to pp at the time of installation of the asset based on estimated discounted cost estimating future asset removal cost is difficult most of these removal obligation are many year or decade in the future and the contract and regulation often have vague description of what removal practice and criterion must be met when the removal event actually occurs asset removal technology and cost regulatory and other compliance consideration expenditure timing and other input into valuation of the obligation including discount and inflation rate are also subject to change normally change in asset removal obligation are reflected in the income statement increase or decrease to dd over the remaining life of the asset however for asset at or nearing the end of their operation well previously sold asset for which we retained the asset removal obligation an increase in the asset removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings because any increase in pp due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment due to the low fair value of these property in addition to asset removal obligation under the above or similar contract permit and regulation we have certain environmental related project these are primarily related to remediation activity required by canada and various state within the united state at exploration and production site future environmental remediation cost are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factor the uncertain magnitude of cleanup cost the unknown time and extent of such remedial action that may be required and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible party see note asset retirement obligation and accrued environmental cost in the note to consolidated financial statement for additional information projected benefit obligation determination of the projected benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plan are important to the recorded amount for such obligation on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement the actuarial determination of projected benefit obligation and company contribution requirement involves judgment about uncertain future event including estimated retirement date salary level at retirement mortality rate lump sum election rate rate of return on plan asset future health care cost trend rate and rate of utilization of health care service by retiree due to the specialized nature of these calculation we engage outside actuarial firm to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligation and company contribution requirement for employee retirement income security act governed pension plan the actuary exercise fiduciary care on behalf of plan participant in the determination of the judgmental assumption used in determining required company contribution into the plan due to differing objective and requirement between financial accounting rule and the pension plan funding regulation promulgated by governmental agency the actuarial method and assumption for the two purpose differ in certain important respect ultimately we will be required to fund all vested benefit under pension and postretirement benefit plan not funded by plan asset or investment return but the judgmental assumption used in the actuarial calculation significantly affect periodic financial statement and funding pattern over time projected benefit obligation are particularly sensitive to the discount rate assumption percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase projected benefit obligation by million benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan asset assumption percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by million while percent decrease in the return on plan asset assumption would increase annual benefit expense by million in determining the discount rate we use yield on high quality fixed income investment matched to the estimated benefit cash flow of our plan we are also exposed to the possibility that lump sum retirement benefit taken from pension plan during the year could exceed the total of service and interest component of annual pension expense and trigger accelerated recognition of portion of table of content unrecognized net actuarial loss and gain these benefit payment are based on decision by plan participant and are therefore difficult to predict in the event there is significant reduction in the expected year of future service of present employee or elimination for significant number of employee the accrual of defined benefit for some or all of their future service we could recognize curtailment gain or loss see note employee benefit plan in the note to consolidated financial statement for additional information contingency number of claim and lawsuit are made against the company arising in the ordinary course of business management exercise judgment related to accounting and disclosure of these claim which includes loss damage and underpayment associated with environmental remediation tax contract and other legal dispute we learn new fact concerning contingence we reassess our position both with respect to amount recognized and disclosed considering change to the probability of additional loss and potential exposure however actual loss can and do vary from estimate for variety of reason including legal arbitration or other third party decision settlement discussion evaluation of scope of damage interpretation of regulatory or contractual term expected timing of future action and proportion of liability shared with other

cost material supply and other miscellaneous inventory such tubular good and well equipment are valued using various method including the weighted average cost method and the first in first out fifo method consistent with industry practice fair value measurement we categorize asset and liability measured at fair value into one of three different level depending on the observability of the input employed in the measurement level input are quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability level input are observable input other than quoted price included within level for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly through market corroborated input level input are unobservable input for the asset or liability reflecting significant modification to observable related market data or our assumption about pricing by market participant derivative instrument derivative instrument are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value if the right of offset exists and certain other criterion are met derivative asset and liability with the same counterparty are netted on the balance sheet and the collateral payable or receivable is netted against derivative asset and derivative liability respectively recognition and classification of the gain or loss that result from recording and adjusting derivative to fair value depends on the purpose for issuing or holding the derivative gain and loss from derivative not accounted for hedge are recognized immediately in earnings for derivative instrument that are designated and qualify fair value hedge the gain or loss from adjusting the derivative to it fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings and to the extent the hedge is effective offset the concurrent recognition of change in the fair value of the hedged item oil and gas exploration and development oil and gas exploration and development cost are accounted for using the successful effort method of accounting property acquisition cost oil and gas leasehold acquisition cost are capitalized and included in the balance sheet caption property plant and equipment pp leasehold impairment is recognized based on exploratory experience and management judgment upon achievement of all condition necessary for reserve to be classified proved the associated leasehold cost are reclassified to proved property exploratory cost geological and geophysical cost and the cost of carrying and retaining undeveloped property are expensed incurred exploratory well cost are capitalized or suspended on the balance sheet pending further evaluation of whether economically recoverable reserve have been found if economically recoverable reserve are not found exploratory well cost are expensed dry hole if exploratory well encounter potentially economic quantity of oil and gas the well cost remain capitalized on the balance sheet long sufficient progress assessing the reserve and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made for complex exploratory discovery it is not unusual to have exploratory well remain suspended on the balance sheet for several year while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the table of content potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co venturer approval of development plan or seek environmental permitting once all required approval and permit have been obtained the project are moved into the development phase and the oil and gas resource are designated proved reserve management review suspended well balance quarterly continuously monitor the result of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work and expense the suspended well cost dry hole when it judge the potential field doe not warrant further investment in the near term see note suspended well and other exploration expense for additional information on suspended well development cost cost incurred to drill and equip development well including unsuccessful development well are capitalized depletion and amortization leasehold cost of producing property are depleted using the unit of production method based on estimated proved oil and gas reserve amortization of intangible development cost is based on the unit of production method using estimated proved developed oil and gas reserve capitalized interest interest from external borrowing is capitalized on major project with an expected construction period of one year or longer capitalized interest is added to the cost of the underlying asset and is amortized over the useful life of the asset in the same manner the underlying asset depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization of pp on producing hydrocarbon property and certain pipeline asset those which are expected to have declining utilization pattern are determined by the unit of production method depreciation and amortization of all other pp are determined by either the individual unit straight line method or the group straight line method for those individual unit that are highly integrated with other unit impairment of property plant and equipment pp used in operation are assessed for impairment whenever change in fact and circumstance indicate possible significant deterioration in the future cash flow expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following update to corporate planning assumption if there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered the asset is monitored by management through an established process where change to significant assumption such price volume and future development plan are reviewed if upon review the sum of the undiscounted pre tax cash flow is le than the carrying value of the asset group the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value through additional amortization or depreciation provision and reported impairment in the period in which the determination of the impairment is made individual asset are grouped for impairment purpose at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flow that are largely independent of the cash flow of other group of asset generally on field by field basis for exploration and production asset because there usually is lack of quoted market price for long lived asset the fair value of impaired asset is typically determined based on the present value of expected future cash flow using discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participant or based on multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transaction of similar asset where possible long lived asset committed by management for disposal within one year are accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value le cost to sell with fair value determined using binding negotiated price if available or present value of expected future cash flow previously described the expected future cash flow used for impairment review and related fair value calculation are based on estimated future production volume price and cost considering all available evidence at the date of review the impairment review includes cash flow from proved developed and undeveloped reserve including any development expenditure necessary to achieve that production additionally when probable and possible reserve exist an appropriate risk adjusted amount of these reserve may be included in the impairment calculation table of content impairment of investment in nonconsolidated entity investment in nonconsolidated entity are assessed for impairment whenever change in the fact and circumstance indicate loss in value ha occurred and annually following update to corporate planning assumption when such condition is judgmentally determined to be other than temporary the carrying value of the investment is written down to fair value the fair value of the impaired investment is based on quoted market price if available or upon the present value of expected future cash flow using discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participant plus market analysis of comparable asset owned by the investee if appropriate maintenance and repair cost of maintenance and repair which are not significant improvement are expensed when incurred property disposition when complete unit of depreciable property are sold the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated with any gain or loss reflected in the gain on disposition line of our consolidated income statement when le than complete unit of depreciable property are disposed of or retired the difference between asset cost and salvage value is charged or credited to accumulated depreciation asset retirement obligation and environmental cost the fair value of legal obligation to retire and remove long lived asset are recorded in the period in which the obligation is incurred typically when the asset is installed at the production location when the liability is initially recorded we capitalize this cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related pp if in subsequent period our estimate of this liability change we will record an adjustment to both the liability and pp over time the liability is increased for the change in it present value and the capitalized cost in pp is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset for additional information see note asset retirement obligation and accrued environmental cost environmental expenditure are expensed or capitalized depending upon their future economic benefit expenditure relating to an existing condition caused by past operation and those having no future economic benefit are expensed liability for environmental expenditure are recorded on an undiscounted basis unless acquired in purchase business combination when environmental assessment or cleanup are probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated recovery of environmental remediation cost from other party are recorded asset when their receipt is probable and estimable guarantee the fair value of guarantee is determined and recorded liability at the time the guarantee is given the initial liability is subsequently reduced we are released from exposure under the guarantee we amortize the guarantee liability over the relevant time period if one exists based on the fact and circumstance surrounding each type of guarantee in case where the guarantee term is indefinite we reverse the liability when we have information indicating the liability is essentially relieved or amortize it over an appropriate time period the fair value of our guarantee exposure decline over time we amortize the guarantee liability to the related income statement line item based on the nature of the guarantee when it becomes probable that we will have to perform on guarantee we accrue separate liability if it is reasonably estimable based on the fact and circumstance at that time we reverse the fair value liability only when there is no further exposure under the guarantee share based compensation we recognize share based compensation expense over the shorter of the service period the stated period of time required to earn the award or the period beginning at the start of the service period and ending when an employee first becomes eligible for retirement we have elected

obligation under various contractual arrangement described below we recognize liability at inception for the fair value of our obligation guarantor for newly issued or modified guarantee unless the carrying amount of the liability is noted below we have not recognized liability because the fair value of the obligation is immaterial in addition unless otherwise stated we are not currently performing with any significance under the guarantee and expect future performance to be either immaterial or have only remote chance of occurrence aplng guarantee at december we had outstanding multiple guarantee in connection with our percent ownership interest in aplng the following is description of the guarantee with value calculated utilizing december exchange rate we have guaranteed aplng performance with regard to construction contract executed in connection with aplng issuance of the train and train notice to proceed we estimate the remaining term of this guarantee is one year our maximum potential amount of future payment related to this guarantee is approximately million and would become payable if aplng cancel the applicable construction contract and doe not perform with respect to the amount owed to the contractor we have issued construction completion guarantee related to the third party project financing secured by aplng our maximum potential amount of future payment under the guarantee is estimated to be billion which could be payable if the full debt financing capacity is utilized and completion of the project is not achieved our guarantee of the project financing will be released upon meeting certain completion test with milestone which we estimate should occur beginning in our maximum exposure at december is billion based upon our pro rata share of the facility used at that date at december the carrying value of this guarantee is approximately million table of content in conjunction with our original purchase of an ownership interest in aplng from origin energy in october we agreed to reimburse origin energy for our share of the existing contingent liability arising under guarantee of an existing obligation of aplng to deliver natural gas under several sale agreement with remaining term of to year our maximum potential liability for future payment or cost of volume delivery under these guarantee is estimated to be billion billion in the event of intentional or reckless breach and would become payable if aplng fails to meet it obligation under these agreement and the obligation can not otherwise be mitigated future payment are considered unlikely the payment or cost of volume delivery would only be triggered if aplng doe not have enough natural gas to meet these sale commitment and if the co venturer do not make necessary equity contribution into aplng we have guaranteed the performance of aplng with regard to certain other contract executed in connection with the project continued development the guarantee have remaining term of up to year or the life of the venture our maximum potential amount of future payment related to these guarantee is approximately million and would become payable if aplng doe not perform other guarantee we have other guarantee with maximum future potential payment amount totaling approximately million which consist primarily of guarantee of the residual value of leased office

asset value are lower than guaranteed amount business condition decline at guaranteed entity or result of nonperformance of contractual term by guaranteed party indemnification over the year we have entered into agreement to sell ownership interest in certain corporation joint venture and asset that gave rise to qualifying indemnification these agreement include indemnification for tax environmental liability employee claim and litigation the term of these indemnification vary greatly the majority of these indemnification are related to environmental issue the term is generally indefinite and the maximum amount of future payment is generally unlimited the carrying amount recorded for these indemnification at december wa approximately million we amortize the indemnification liability over the relevant time period if one exists based on the fact and circumstance surrounding each type of indemnity in case where the indemnification term is indefinite we will reverse the liability when we have information the liability is essentially relieved or amortize the liability over an appropriate time period the fair value of our indemnification exposure decline although it is reasonably possible future payment may exceed amount recorded due to the nature of the indemnification it is not possible to make reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payment included in the recorded carrying amount at december were approximately million of environmental accrual for known contamination that are included in the asset retirement obligation and accrued environmental cost line on our consolidated balance sheet for additional information about environmental liability see note contingency and commitment on april the separation of our downstream business wa completed creating two independent energy company conocophillips and phillips in connection with the separation we entered into an indemnification and release agreement which provides for cross indemnity between phillips and and established procedure for handling claim subject to indemnification and related matter we evaluated the impact of the indemnification given and the phillips indemnification received of the separation date and concluded those fair value were immaterial on march supplier to one of the refinery that wa included in phillips part of the separation of our downstream business formally registered phillips party to the supply agreement thereby triggering guarantee we provided at the time of separation our maximum potential liability for future table of content payment under this guarantee which would become payable if phillips doe not perform it contractual obligation under the supply agreement is approximately billion at december the carrying value of this guarantee is approximately million and the remaining term is nine year because phillips ha indemnified for loss incurred under this guarantee we have recorded an indemnification asset from phillips of approximately million the recorded indemnification asset amount represents the estimated fair value of the guarantee however if we are required to perform under the guarantee we would expect to recover from phillips any amount in excess of that value provided phillips is going concern note contingency and commitment number of lawsuit involving variety of claim arising in the ordinary course of business have been made against conocophillips we also may be required to remove or mitigate the effect on the environment of the placement storage disposal or release of certain chemical mineral and petroleum substance at various active and inactive site we regularly ass the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingency in the case of all known contingency other than those related to income tax we accrue liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable if range of amount can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is better estimate than any other amount then the minimum of the range is accrued we do not reduce these liability for potential insurance or third party recovery if applicable we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third party recovery with respect to income tax related contingency we use cumulative probability weighted loss accrual in case where sustaining tax position is le than certain see note income tax for additional information about income tax related contingency based on currently available information we believe it is remote that future cost related to known contingent liability exposure will exceed current accrual by an amount that would have material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statement we learn new fact concerning contingency we reassess our position both with respect to accrued liability and other potential exposure estimate particularly sensitive to future change include contingent liability recorded for environmental remediation tax and legal matter estimated future environmental remediation cost are subject to change due to such factor the uncertain magnitude of cleanup cost the unknown time and extent of such remedial action that may be required and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible party estimated future cost related to tax and legal matter are subject to change event evolve and additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation process environmental we are subject to international federal state and local environmental law and regulation when we prepare our consolidated financial statement we record accrual for environmental liability based on management best estimate using all information that is available at the time we measure estimate and base liability on currently available fact existing technology and presently enacted law and regulation taking into account stakeholder and business consideration when measuring environmental liability we also consider our prior experience in remediation of contaminated site other company cleanup experience and data released by the environmental protection agency epa or other organization we consider unasserted claim in our determination of environmental liability and we accrue them in the period they are both probable and reasonably estimable although liability of those potentially responsible for environmental remediation cost is generally joint and several for federal site and frequently so for other site we are usually only one of many company cited at particular site due to the joint and several liability we could be responsible for all cleanup cost related to any site at which we have been designated potentially responsible party we have been successful to date in sharing cleanup cost with other financially sound company many of the site at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the epa or the agency concerned prior to actual cleanup those potentially responsible normally ass the site condition apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation in some instance we may have no liability or may attain settlement of liability where it appears that other potentially responsible party may be financially unable to bear their proportional table of content share we consider this inability in estimating our potential liability and we adjust our accrual accordingly result of various acquisition in the past we assumed certain environmental obligation some of these environmental obligation are mitigated by indemnification made by others for our benefit and some of the indemnification are subject to dollar limit and time limit we are currently participating in environmental assessment and cleanup at numerous federal superfund and comparable state and international site after an assessment of environmental exposure for cleanup and other cost we make accrual on an undiscounted basis except those acquired in purchase business combination which we record on discounted basis for planned investigation and remediation activity for site where it is probable future cost will be incurred and these cost can be reasonably estimated we have not reduced these accrual for possible insurance recovery in the future we may be involved in additional environmental assessment cleanup and proceeding see note asset retirement obligation and accrued environmental cost for summary of our accrued environmental liability legal proceeding we are subject to various lawsuit and claim including but not limited to matter involving oil and gas royalty and severance tax payment gas measurement and valuation method contract dispute environmental damage personal injury and property damage our primary exposure for such matter relate to alleged royalty and tax underpayment on certain federal state and privately owned property and claim of alleged environmental contamination from historic operation we will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matter our legal organization applies it knowledge experience and professional judgment to the specific characteristic of our case employing litigation management process to manage and monitor the legal proceeding against our process facilitates the early evaluation and quantification of potential exposure in individual case this process also enables to track those case that have been scheduled for trial and or mediation based on professional judgment and experience in using these litigation management tool and available information about current development in all our case our legal organization regularly ass the adequacy of current accrual and determines if adjustment of existing accrual or establishment of new accrual is required other contingency we have contingent liability resulting from throughput agreement with pipeline and processing company not associated with financing arrangement under these agreement we may be required to provide any such company with additional fund through advance and penalty for fee related to throughput capacity not utilized in
