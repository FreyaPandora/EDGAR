accepting the depleted battery from the customer without any additional charge automobile manufacturer and dealer regulation state law regulate the manufacture distribution and sale of automobile and generally require motor vehicle manufacturer and dealer to be licensed in order to sell vehicle directly to consumer in the state we open additional tesla store and service center we secure dealer license or their equivalent and engage in sale activity to sell our vehicle directly to consumer few state such texas and michigan do not permit automobile manufacturer to be licensed dealer or to act in the capacity of dealer or otherwise restrict manufacturer ability to deliver or service vehicle to sell vehicle to resident of state where we are not licensed dealer we generally conduct the sale of the state via the internet phone or mail in such state we have opened gallery that serve an educational purpose and are not retail location we expand our retail footprint in the united state some automobile dealer trade association have both challenged the legality of our operation in court and used administrative and legislative process to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing store or expand to new location although we have thus far prevailed in every lawsuit brought by dealer association we expect that the dealer association will continue to mount challenge to our business model in addition we expect the dealer association to actively lobby state licensing agency and legislator to interpret existing law or enact new law in way not favorable to tesla ownership and operation of it own retail and service location while we have analyzed the principal law in the eu china japan uk and australia relating to our distribution model and believe we comply with such law we have not performed complete analysis of all jurisdiction in which we may sell vehicle accordingly there may be law in certain jurisdiction that may restrict our sale and service operation competition the worldwide automotive market particularly for alternative fuel vehicle is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future we introduce additional lower priced vehicle such our model we believe the primary competitive factor in our market include but are not limited to technological innovation product quality and safety service option product performance design and styling brand perception product price and manufacturing efficiency we believe that our vehicle compete in the market both based on their traditional segment classification well based on their propulsion technology for example model competes primarily in the extremely competitive premium sedan market with internal combustion vehicle from more established automobile manufacturer including audi bmw lexus and mercedes our vehicle also compete with vehicle propelled by alternative fuel principally electricity many established and new automobile manufacturer have entered or have announced plan to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market overall we believe these announcement and vehicle introduction promote the development of the alternative fuel vehicle market by highlighting the attractiveness of alternative fuel vehicle particularly those fueled by electricity relative to the internal combustion vehicle bmw daimler nissan fiat ford and mitsubishi among others have electric vehicle available today moreover porsche lexus audi volkswagen and volvo well number of prospective automobile manufacturer are also developing electric vehicle electric vehicle have also already been brought to market in china and other foreign country and we expect number of those manufacturer to enter the united state market well in addition several manufacturer including general motor toyota ford and honda are each selling hybrid vehicle and certain of these manufacturer have announced plug in version of their hybrid vehicle the market for energy storage product is also highly competitive established company well emerging company have introduced product that are similar to our product portfolio for instance there are several company providing individual component of energy storage system such cell battery module and power electronics well others providing integrated system most of our current and potential competitor in both the automotive and energy storage market have significantly greater resource than we do may be able to devote greater resource to the manufacture sale and support of their product and have other advantage we believe our exclusive focus on electric vehicle electric vehicle component and energy storage product well our history of vehicle development and production however are the basis on which we can

including through trademark copyright trade secret including know patent patent application employee and third party nondisclosure agreement intellectual property license and other contractual right additionally consistent with our mission to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport we announced patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate lawsuit any party for infringing our patent through activity relating to electric vehicle or related equipment for so long such party is acting in good faith we made this pledge in order to encourage the advancement of common rapidly evolving platform for electric vehicle thereby benefiting other company making electric vehicle and the world segment information we operate one reportable segment which is the design development manufacturing and sale of electric vehicle employee of december we had full time employee to date we have not experienced any work stoppage and we consider our relationship with our

not incorporated by reference into this annual report on form item risk factor you should carefully consider the risk described together with the other information set forth in this report which could materially affect our business financial condition and future result the risk described below are not the only risk facing our company risk and uncertainty not currently known to or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result risk related to our business and industry we may experience significant delay or other complication in the design manufacture launch and production ramp of new vehicle such model and future vehicle such model which could harm our brand business prospect financial condition and operating result we may experience significant delay or other complication in bringing to market and ramping production of new vehicle such model while we commenced model delivery late in the third quarter of we have only recently begun manufacturing model vehicle and various factor could result in delay in it production ramp including the capacity of our supplier to deliver component at the timing and volume we require and production limitation that are needed to maintain our quality production standard in addition since model share certain production facility with the model the volume or efficiency of model production may be impacted if the ramp of model is not efficient we plan we have experienced delay or other complication in connection with new vehicle model in the past such production ramp delay for model in and the all wheel drive dual motor model and the launch of model any significant additional delay or other complication in the ramp of model or the development manufacture launch and production ramp of our future vehicle including complication associated with expanding our production capacity supply chain or regulatory approval could materially damage our brand business prospect financial condition and operating result the complexity in our business continues to grow we introduce new product and variant we have limited experience simultaneously designing testing manufacturing upgrading adapting and selling our electric vehicle well limited experience allocating our available resource among the design and production of multiple vehicle such model model and model and the variant thereof in the past when we have added complexity to our production line we have occasionally experienced unexpected delay similar problem may occur in the future we simultaneously produce model and model vehicle well future vehicle and tesla energy product we may be unable to meet our production and delivery plan for model and model both of which could harm our business and prospect we have significantly increased vehicle production and delivery and our plan call for significant increase in vehicle production and delivery going forward our ability to further increase vehicle production including the ramp of model production will depend upon number of factor including our ability to use new manufacturing process planned while maintaining our desired quality level our supplier ability to deliver sufficient volume of quality part to in timely manner and carefully but efficiently making design and production change to ensure consistently high quality certain supplier have historically experienced delay in meeting our demand or have sought to renegotiate the term of the supply arrangement and we continue to focus on supplier capability and constraint while our plan call for to significantly increase vehicle production and delivery in short amount of time we may be unable to do so any delay or disruption in our production of model and model in line with our plan could materially damage our brand business prospect financial condition and operating result in addition we have introduced number of new manufacturing technology and technique for our vehicle such aluminum spot welding system and high speed blow forming of certain difficult to stamp vehicle part our vehicle also have unique design feature such inch display screen retractable exterior door handle and all new dual motor and autopilot hardware introduced in model and falcon wing door and other unique feature introduced in model each of which pose different manufacturing challenge concurrent with the significant increase in our planned vehicle production level we will also need to continue to significantly increase delivery of our vehicle we have limited experience in delivering high volume of vehicle and we may face difficulty meeting our delivery and growth plan into both existing market well new market into which we expand if we are unable to ramp up to meet our delivery goal globally this could have material adverse effect on our business prospect financial condition and operating result finally detailed long term testing of quality reliability and durability of our vehicle is ongoing and in the case of model vehicle ha only recently commenced and any negative result from such testing could cause production or delivery delay or cost increase our long term success will be dependent upon our ability to achieve market acceptance of our vehicle including model and model and new vehicle model such model there is no guarantee that model model or our future vehicle such model will continue to be successfully accepted by the general public especially in the long term although we have successfully grown demand for model to date and have seen strong initial demand for model and we believe that we will be able to continue to grow demand for these vehicle there is no guarantee that future demand for model or model will meet our expectation additionally we have limited experience in introducing new vehicle although our reservation conversion rate for model ha been strong we have only recently commenced production and delivery of model to the extent that we are not able to build model in accordance with consumer expectation customer may cancel their reservation and our future sale could be harmed while we believe that there will continue to be separate and strong demand for both model and model we have limited experience in selling multiple vehicle model at the time although we believe that each of our vehicle and their variant meet distinct segment of the automotive market if our vehicle end up competing with one another in the market then our ability to sell each vehicle model at planned quantity or price may be impacted beyond model we have announced our intent to develop model which we intend to offer at lower price point and to produce at high volume we have not yet finalized the design engineering or material and component sourcing plan for model if we are not successful in bringing it to market at the expected price point and the expected volume our operating result may suffer additionally while we expect model to be an extremely popular vehicle we do not know long term demand for model will be and whether it will meet our expectation furthermore the market for vehicle in the price range we expect for model is larger but more competitive than the market for model and model problem or delay in bringing the gigafactory online and operating it in line with our expectation could negatively affect the production and profitability of our product such model or tesla energy product to lower the cost of cell production and produce cell in high volume we intend to integrate the production of lithium ion cell and finished battery pack for our vehicle including model and tesla energy product at our new gigafactory we have limited experience in building factory and no direct experience in the production of lithium ion cell also the cost and complexity of building and operating the gigafactory could exceed our current expectation and the gigafactory may take longer to bring online for lithium ion cell and battery pack production than we anticipate if we are unable to build the gigafactory in timely manner to produce high volume of quality lithium ion cell at reasonable price our ability to supply battery pack to our vehicle and other product according to our schedule and or at price that allows to sell them profitably and in the quantity we estimate could be constrained any such problem or delay with the gigafactory could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospect financial condition and operating result if our vehicle or vehicle that contain our powertrains fail to perform expected our ability to develop market and sell our electric vehicle could be harmed if our vehicle or vehicle that contain our powertrains were to contain defect in design and manufacture that cause them not to perform expected or that require repair our ability to develop market and sell our vehicle could be harmed for example the operation of our vehicle is highly dependent on software which is inherently complex and could conceivably contain defect and error issue that have historically been experienced by customer include those related to the software for the inch display screen the panoramic roof and the volt battery in the model although we attempt to remedy any issue we observe in our vehicle effectively and rapidly possible such effort may not be timely may hamper production or may not be up to the satisfaction of our customer while we have performed extensive internal testing we currently have limited frame of reference by which to evaluate the long term performance of our battery pack powertrains vehicle and tesla energy product there can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defect in our product prior to their sale to consumer any vehicle product defect or any other failure of our vehicle to perform expected could harm our reputation and result in delivery delay product recall product liability claim significant warranty and other expense and could have material adverse impact on our business financial condition operating result and prospect our model vehicle have not yet been evaluated by nhtsa for it star safety rating and while based on our internal testing we expect to obtain comparable rating to those achieved by model there is no assurance this will occur we are dependent on our supplier the majority of which are single source supplier and the inability of these supplier to continue to deliver or their refusal to deliver necessary component of our vehicle in timely manner at price quality level and volume acceptable to would have material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating result model and model contain numerous purchased part which we source globally from hundred of direct supplier the majority of are currently single source supplier despite effort to qualify and obtain component from multiple source whenever possible furthermore we do not maintain long term agreement with number of our supplier while we may be able to establish alternate supply relationship or engineer replacement component for our single source component we may be unable to do so in the short term or at all at price or cost that are favorable to in particular while we believe that we will be able to secure alternate source of supply for most of our single sourced component in relatively short time frame qualifying alternate supplier or developing our own replacement for certain highly customized component of our vehicle may be time consuming costly and may force to make additional modification to vehicle design this limited supply chain expose to multiple potential source of delivery failure or component shortage for the production of our vehicle and powertrain component we may experience delay due to supply chain disruption with respect to model model model and any other future vehicle we may produce such those we experienced in in connection with our slower than anticipated model ramp in addition our currently ongoing transition from low to high volume production tooling for model may take longer than expected which may adversely impact our short term financial result change in business condition labor issue war governmental change natural disaster such the march earthquake in japan and other factor beyond our control or which we do not presently anticipate could also affect our supplier ability to deliver component to on timely basis furthermore if we experience significantly increased demand or need to replace certain existing supplier there can be no assurance that additional supply of component part will be available when required on term that are favorable to or that any supplier would allocate sufficient supply to in order to meet our requirement or fill our order in timely manner or that we could engineer replacement component ourselves change in our supply chain have resulted in the past and may result in the future in increased cost we have also experienced cost increase from certain of our supplier in order to meet our quality target and development timeline well due to design change that we made and we may experience similar cost increase in the future additionally we are negotiating with existing supplier for cost reduction seeking new and le expensive supplier for certain part and attempting to redesign certain part to make them le expensive to produce if we are unsuccessful in our effort to control and reduce supplier cost our operating result will suffer finally in october we entered into an amendment to our existing supply agreement with panasonic corporation in order to address our anticipated short to medium term lithium ion battery cell need while we expect that this supply agreement amended will provide with sufficient cell for the next few year we may not be able to meet our long term need including for model and other program we may introduce without securing additional supplier or other source for cell we have signed an agreement with panasonic to be our partner in the gigafactory and be responsible for among other thing manufacturing cell from there for use in our product if we encounter unexpected difficulty with our current supplier including panasonic and if we are unable to fill these need from other supplier we could experience production delay which could have material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating result our future growth is dependent upon consumer willingness to adopt electric vehicle our growth is highly dependent upon the adoption by consumer of alternative fuel vehicle in general and electric vehicle in particular if the market for electric vehicle not develop we expect or develops more slowly than we expect our business prospect financial condition and operating result will be harmed the market for alternative fuel vehicle is relatively new rapidly evolving and subject to numerous external factor such perception about electric vehicle quality safety performance cost and the convenience of charging perception about the limited range over which electric vehicle may be driven on single battery charge the availability of other type of alternative fuel vehicle including plug in hybrid electric vehicle improvement in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine volatility in the cost of oil and gasoline government regulation and economic incentive and access to charging facility if we fail to manage future growth effectively we rapidly grow our company especially internationally we may not be able to produce market sell and service our vehicle successfully any failure to manage our growth effectively could materially and adversely affect our business prospect operating result and financial condition we continue to expand our operation significantly internationally particularly in asia our future operating result depend to large extent on our ability to manage this expansion and growth successfully risk that we face in undertaking this global expansion include controlling expense establishing sufficient sale service and supercharger facility in timely manner adapting our product to meet local requirement implementing the required infrastructure system and process and finding and hiring significant number of additional personnel including manufacturing personnel design personnel engineer and service technician if we are unable to adequately reduce the manufacturing cost of model control manufacturing cost for model or otherwise control the cost associated with operating our business our financial condition and operating result will suffer we have gradually ramped production of model manufacturing cost per vehicle have decreased while we expect ongoing cost reduction to be realized by both and our supplier there is no guarantee we will be able to achieve sufficient cost saving to reach our gross margin and profitability goal we incur significant cost related to procuring the raw material required to manufacture our vehicle assembling vehicle and compensating our personnel we may also incur substantial cost or cost overrun in increasing the production capability of our model model and powertrain manufacturing facility furthermore if we are unable to produce model pursuant to our plan due to cost overrun or other unexpected cost we may not be able to meet our gross margin and other financial target furthermore many of the factor that impact our operating cost are beyond our control such potential increase in the cost of our raw material and component such lithium ion battery cell or aluminum used to produce body panel if we are unable to keep our operating cost aligned with the level of revenue we generate our operating result business and prospect will be harmed we may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectation about our business which would cause our stock price to decline we occasionally provide guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance such projection regarding sale and production well anticipated future revenue gross margin profitability and cash flow correctly identifying key factor affecting business condition and predicting future event is inherently an uncertain process and our guidance may not ultimately be accurate our guidance is based on certain assumption such those relating to anticipated production and sale volume and average sale price supplier and commodity cost and planned cost reduction if our guidance is not accurate or varies from actual result due to our inability to meet our assumption or the impact on our financial performance that could occur result of various risk and uncertainty the market value of our common stock could decline significantly our vehicle make use of lithium ion battery cell which have been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flame and such event have raised concern and future event may lead to additional concern about the battery used in automotive application the battery pack that we produce make use of lithium ion cell on rare occasion lithium ion cell can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flame in manner that can ignite nearby material well other lithium ion cell while we have designed the battery pack to passively contain any single cell release of energy without spreading to neighboring cell there can be no assurance that field or testing failure of our vehicle or other battery pack that we produce will not occur which could subject to lawsuit product recall or redesign effort all of which would be time consuming and expensive also negative public perception regarding the suitability of lithium ion cell for automotive application or any future incident involving lithium ion cell such vehicle or other fire even if such incident doe not involve our vehicle could seriously harm our business in addition we store significant number of lithium ion cell at our manufacturing facility any mishandling of battery cell may cause disruption to the operation of our facility while we have implemented safety procedure related to the handling of the cell there can be no assurance that safety issue or fire related to the cell would not disrupt our operation such damage or injury would likely lead to adverse publicity and potentially safety recall moreover any failure of competitor electric vehicle may cause indirect adverse publicity for and our electric vehicle such adverse publicity would negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospect financial condition and operating result we are exposed to fluctuation in currency exchange rate which could negatively affect our financial result our revenue and cost denominated in foreign currency are not completely matched we have increased model delivery in market outside of the united state we have much higher revenue than cost denominated in other currency such the euro norwegian krone chinese yuan and canadian dollar the recent strengthening of the dollar therefore ha reduced and any further strengthening of the dollar would tend to further reduce our revenue measured in dollar in addition portion of our cost and expense have been and we anticipate will continue to be denominated in foreign currency including the japanese yen if we do not have fully offsetting revenue in these currency and if the value of the dollar depreciates significantly against these currency our cost measured in dollar percent of our revenue will correspondingly increase and our margin will suffer result our operating result could be adversely affected our resale value guarantee and leasing program expose to the risk that the resale value of vehicle returned to are lower than our estimate and may result in lower revenue gross margin profitability and liquidity we offer resale value guarantee to many of our customer under which such customer may sell their vehicle back to at certain point in time at pre determined resale value customer can lease our vehicle through both leasing partner and from directly through our captive finance company the resale value of any vehicle resold or returned to pursuant to these program may be lower than our estimate which are based on limited secondary market for our vehicle if the volume of vehicle returned to is higher than our estimate and or we are not able to resell them timely or at all our liquidity could be negatively impacted in case where customer retain their vehicle past the guarantee period our gross margin will be negatively impacted all remaining revenue and cost related to the vehicle will be recognized at no gross profit we apply lease accounting on sale of vehicle with resale value guarantee and on lease made directly by under lease accounting we recognize the associated revenue and cost of the vehicle sale over time rather than fully upfront at vehicle delivery result these program generate lower revenue in the period the car is delivered and higher gross margin during the period of the resale value guarantee compared to purchase in which the resale value guarantee doe not apply higher than anticipated uptake under these program could therefore have an adverse impact on our near term revenue and operating result moreover unlike the resale value guarantee program or program with leasing partner which do not impact our cash flow and liquidity at the time of vehicle delivery under lease held directly by we may receive only very small portion of the total vehicle purchase price at the time of lease followed by stream of payment over the term of the lease to the extent we expand our leasing program without securing external financing or business partner to support such expansion our cash flow and liquidity could also be negatively impacted if we fail to effectively manage the residual financing and credit risk related to our direct tesla leasing program our business may suffer we offer financing arrangement through our local subsidiary in the united state canada germany and the uk including leasing directly through certain of those subsidiary the profitability of the leasing program depends on our ability to accurately project residual value secure adequate financing and or business partner to fund and grow this program and manage customer credit risk if actual residual value of our vehicle are below our estimate we may suffer lower profitability or potentially have loss if we are unable to adequately fund our leasing program with either internal fund or external financing source we may be unable to grow our sale additionally if we do not properly screen customer for their creditworthiness we may be exposed to excessive credit risk and associated loss furthermore if our leasing business grows substantially our business may suffer if we can not effectively manage the greater level of residual and credit risk resulting from growth finally if we do not successfully monitor and comply with applicable national state and or local financial regulation and consumer protection law governing lease transaction we may become subject to enforcement action or penalty either of which may harm our business increase in cost disruption of supply or shortage of raw material in particular lithium ion cell could harm our business we may experience increase in the cost or sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of raw material any such increase or supply interruption could materially and negatively impact our business prospect financial condition and operating result we use various raw material in our business including aluminum steel nickel and copper the price for these raw material fluctuate depending on market condition and global demand for these material and could adversely affect our business and operating result for instance we are exposed to multiple risk relating to lithium ion cell these risk include the inability or unwillingness of current battery manufacturer to build or operate battery cell manufacturing plant to supply the number of lithium ion cell we require disruption in the supply of cell due to quality issue or recall by battery cell manufacturer an increase in the cost of raw material used in the cell and fluctuation in the value of the japanese yen against the dollar our battery cell purchase are currently denominated in japanese yen our business is dependent on the continued supply of battery cell for the battery pack used in our vehicle and energy storage product while we believe several source of the battery cell are available for such battery pack we have fully qualified only very limited number of supplier for the cell used in such battery pack and have very limited flexibility in changing cell supplier in particular we have fully qualified only one supplier for the cell used in battery pack for our production vehicle any disruption in the supply of battery cell from such vendor could disrupt production of our vehicle and of the battery pack we produce for other automobile manufacturer such time different supplier is fully qualified furthermore fluctuation or shortage in petroleum and other economic condition may cause to experience significant increase in freight charge and raw material cost substantial increase in the price for our raw material or price charged to such those charged by our battery cell manufacturer would increase our operating cost and could reduce our margin if we can not recoup the increased cost through increased vehicle price any attempt to increase vehicle price in response to increased raw material cost could result in cancellation of vehicle order and reservation and therefore materially and adversely affect our brand image business prospect and operating result we may become subject to product liability claim which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully defend or insure against such claim product liability claim could harm our business prospect operating result and financial condition the automobile industry experience significant product liability claim and we face inherent risk of exposure to claim in the event our vehicle do not perform expected resulting in personal injury or death we also may face claim related to any misuse or failure of our new autopilot technology successful product liability claim against with respect to any aspect of our vehicle could require to pay substantial monetary award our risk in this area are particularly pronounced given the limited number of vehicle delivered to date and limited field experience of those vehicle moreover product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity about our vehicle and business and would have material adverse effect on our brand business prospect and operating result we self insure against the risk of product liability claim meaning that any product liability claim will have to be paid from company fund not by insurance the automotive market is highly competitive and we may not be successful in competing in this industry we currently face competition from new and established and international competitor and expect to face competition from others in the future including competition from company with new technology the worldwide automotive market particularly for alternative fuel vehicle is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future many established and new automobile manufacturer have entered or have announced plan to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market for example bmw daimler nissan and many other large company have announced or are also reported to be developing electric vehicle in addition several manufacturer including general motor toyota ford and honda are selling hybrid vehicle including plug in hybrid vehicle most of our current and potential competitor have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing and other resource than we do and may be able to devote greater resource to the design development manufacturing distribution promotion sale and support of their product virtually all of our competitor have more extensive customer base and broader customer and industry relationship than we do and almost all of these company have longer operating history and greater name recognition than we do increased competition could result in lower vehicle unit sale price reduction revenue shortfall loss of customer and loss of market share which could harm our business prospect financial condition and operating result demand in the automobile industry is volatile which may lead to lower vehicle unit sale and adversely affect our operating result volatility of demand in the automobile industry may materially and adversely affect our business prospect operating result and financial condition the market in which we currently compete and plan to compete in the future have been subject to considerable volatility in demand in recent period including recent softening of the premium sedan category low volume vehicle producer we have le financial resource than more established automobile manufacturer to withstand change in the market and disruption in demand volatility in demand may lead to lower vehicle unit sale and increased inventory which may result in further downward price pressure and adversely affect our business prospect financial condition and operating result these effect may have more pronounced impact on our business given our relatively smaller scale and financial resource compared to many incumbent automobile manufacturer if we are unable to establish and maintain confidence in our long term business prospect among consumer analyst and within our industry then our financial condition operating result business prospect and stock price may suffer materially consumer may be le likely to purchase our vehicle if they are not convinced that our business will succeed or that our operation will continue for many year similarly supplier and other third party will be le likely to invest time and resource in developing business relationship with if they are not convinced that our business will succeed accordingly in order to build and maintain our business we must maintain confidence among customer supplier analyst and other party in our liquidity and long term business prospect maintaining such confidence may be particularly complicated by certain factor such our limited operating history unfamiliarity with our product competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicle many of these factor are largely outside our control and any negative perception about our long term business prospect even if exaggerated or unfounded would likely harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional fund if needed our vehicle have unique servicing requirement and we are using different service model from the one typically used in the automobile industry if we are unable to address the service requirement of our existing and future customer our business will be materially and adversely affected servicing electric vehicle is different than servicing vehicle with internal combustion engine and requires specialized skill including high voltage training and servicing technique if we are unable to satisfactorily service our vehicle our ability to generate customer loyalty grow our business and sell additional vehicle could be impaired we service our vehicle through our company owned tesla service center certain of our store and through our mobile service technician known the tesla ranger we will need to open new standalone service center in location around the world and hire and train significant number of new employee to staff these service center and act tesla ranger in order to successfully maintain our fleet of delivered vehicle if we do not continue to adequately address the service requirement of our customer to their satisfaction particularly the volume of vehicle we are able to deliver annually increase our business would be harmed our plan to expand our network of tesla store service center and supercharger will require significant cash investment and management resource and may not meet our expectation with respect to additional sale of our electric vehicle in addition we may not be able to open store or service center in certain state or supercharger in desired location our plan to expand our network of tesla store service center and supercharger will require significant cash investment and management resource and may not meet our expectation with respect to additional sale of our vehicle this ongoing global expansion may not have the desired effect of increasing sale and expanding our brand presence to the degree we are anticipating we will also need to ensure we are in compliance with any regulatory requirement applicable to the sale and service of our vehicle in those jurisdiction which could take considerable time and expense if we experience any delay in expanding our network of tesla store service center and supercharger this could lead to decrease in sale of our vehicle and could negatively impact our business prospect financial condition and operating result we face risk associated with our international operation and expansion including unfavorable regulatory political tax and labor condition and establishing ourselves in new market all of which could harm our business we currently have international operation and subsidiary in various country and jurisdiction that are subject to the legal political regulatory and social requirement and economic condition in these jurisdiction additionally part of our growth strategy we will continue to expand our sale service and supercharger location internationally we have limited experience however selling and servicing our product internationally well limited experience installing and operating supercharger internationally furthermore international expansion requires to make significant expenditure including the establishment of local operating entity hiring of local employee and establishing facility in advance of generating any revenue we are subject to number of risk associated with international business activity that may increase our cost impact our ability to sell our electric vehicle and require significant management attention these risk include conforming our vehicle to various international regulatory and safety requirement difficulty in establishing staffing and managing foreign operation challenge in attracting customer foreign government tax regulation and permit requirement our ability to enforce our contractual right trade restriction custom regulation tariff and price or exchange control and preference of foreign nation for domestically produced vehicle additionally we have expanded into new international market we historically faced challenge with ensuring that our charging equipment work successfully with the charging infrastructure in such market including in norway and china if customer experience problem with the way our charging equipment work with the local charging infrastructure or we are unable to adapt our equipment to resolve such problem then the viability and acceptance of our vehicle in such market could be materially and adversely affected if we fail to successfully address these risk our business prospect operating result and financial condition could be materially harmed the unavailability reduction or elimination of government and economic incentive in the and abroad supporting the development and adoption of electric vehicle could have some impact on demand for our vehicle we currently benefit from certain government and economic incentive supporting the development and adoption of electric vehicle in the united state and abroad such incentive include among other thing tax credit or rebate that encourage the purchase of electric vehicle in norway for example the purchase of electric vehicle is not currently subject to import tax tax on non recurring vehicle fee the value added tax or the purchase tax that apply to the purchase of gas powered vehicle notably the quantum of incentive program promoting electric vehicle is tiny fraction of the amount of incentive that are provided to gas powered vehicle through the oil and gas industry notwithstanding that the former promotes social good while the latter contributes to significant social harm nevertheless even the limited benefit from such program could be reduced eliminated or exhausted for example on january previously available incentive in denmark that favored the purchase of electric vehicle expired and wa replaced with newly phased in incentive that is le generous than the incentive that it replaced in certain circumstance there is pressure from the oil and gas lobby or related special interest to bring about such development which could have some negative impact on demand for our vehicle our strategic relationship with third party such panasonic are subject to various risk which could adversely affect our business and future prospect our strategic relationship with third party such panasonic which supply with battery cell for use in model and model and which is our strategic partner in the gigafactory pose various risk to including potential loss of access to important technology and part for producing servicing and supporting our product potential loss of business and adverse publicity moreover factor that may not be within our partner control such material pricing may impact our ability to realize the goal of certain strategic relationship such cost and gross margin target in addition these third party may not perform expected under our agreement with them such with respect to quality of production part and timeliness of their delivery and we may have disagreement or dispute with these third party the occurrence of any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business prospect financial condition and operating result if we are unable to attract and or retain key employee and hire qualified personnel our ability to compete could be harmed the loss of the service of any of our key employee could disrupt our operation delay the development and introduction of our vehicle and service and negatively impact our business prospect and operating result in particular we are highly dependent on the service of elon musk our chief executive officer and jb straubel our chief technical officer none of our key employee is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and we may not be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain executive officer and other key technology sale marketing engineering manufacturing and support personnel and any failure to do so could adversely impact our business prospect financial condition and operating result key talent may leave tesla due to various factor such very competitive labor market for talented individual with automotive experience currently in california there is increasing competition for talented individual with the specialized knowledge of electric vehicle software engineer manufacturing engineer and other skilled employee and this competition affect both our ability to retain key employee and hire new one our continued success depends upon our continued ability to hire new employee in timely manner and retain current employee additionally we compete with both mature and prosperous company that have far greater financial resource than we do and start ups and emerging company that promise short term growth opportunity any difficulty in retaining current employee or recruiting new one would have an adverse effect on our performance we are highly dependent on the service of elon musk our chief executive officer we are highly dependent on the service of elon musk our chief executive officer product architect chairman of our board of director and largest stockholder although mr musk spends significant time with tesla and is highly active in our management doe not devote full time and attention to tesla mr musk also currently serf chief executive officer and chief technical officer of space exploration technology developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicle and chairman of solarcity solar provider we are subject to various environmental and safety law and regulation that could impose substantial cost upon and negatively impact our ability to operate our manufacturing facility an automobile manufacturer we are subject to complex environmental health and safety law and regulation at numerous level including law relating to the use handling storage disposal and human exposure to hazardous material both in the united state and abroad the cost of compliance including remediating contamination if any is found on our property and of any change to our operation mandated by new law or amendment to existing law may be significant we may also face unexpected delay in obtaining the necessary permit and approval required by such law in connection with our manufacturing facility which would hinder our operation of these facility such cost and delay may adversely impact our business prospect and operating result furthermore any violation of these law may result in substantial fine and penalty remediation cost third party damage or suspension or cessation of our operation our business may be adversely affected by any disruption caused by union activity although none of our employee is currently represented by labor union it is common for employee at automobile company to belong to union which can result in higher employee cost and increased risk of work stoppage although we work diligently to provide the best possible work environment for our employee they may still decide to join or seek recognition to form labor union or we may be required to become union signatory furthermore we are directly or indirectly dependent upon company with unionized work force such part supplier and trucking and freight company and work stoppage or strike organized by such union could have material adverse impact on our business financial condition or operating result if work stoppage occurs it could delay the manufacture and sale of our product and have material adverse effect on our business prospect operating result or financial condition we are subject to substantial regulation which is evolving and unfavorable change or failure by to comply with these regulation could substantially harm our business and operating result motor vehicle are subject to substantial regulation under international federal state and local law we incur significant cost in complying with these regulation and may be required to incur additional cost to comply with any change to such regulation also we are subject to law and regulation applicable to the import sale and service of automobile internationally for example we are required to meet vehicle specific safety standard that are often materially different from requirement thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicle and system to ensure regulatory compliance this process necessitates that foreign regulatory official review and certify our vehicle prior to market entry in addition we must comply with regulation applicable to vehicle after they enter the market including foreign reporting requirement and recall management system additionally we recently released vehicle software update that delivers range of new autopilot feature that relieve driver of the most tedious and potentially dangerous aspect of road travel autopilot is completely new feature that and foreign regulator have limited experience with there is risk that regulator could take action impacting whether and how our customer are able to use our vehicle equipped for autopilot which could adversely affect our business we are subject to various privacy and

and financial condition we previously experienced product recall in may october june and november none of which wa related to our electric powertrain or that resulted in vehicle crash or personal injury reported to in april we determined that condition caused by insufficient torqueing of the rear inner hub flange bolt existed in some of our tesla roadster result of missed process during the manufacture of the tesla roadster glider in october we initiated product recall after the volt low voltage auxiliary cable in single vehicle chafed against the edge of carbon fiber panel in the vehicle causing short smoke and possible fire behind the right front headlamp of the vehicle in june we initiated recall of slightly more than one thousand model vehicle to inspect and repair rear seat striker that may have been compromised during the assembly process rear seat striker are used to retain the rear seat back in an upright position failure of this component may have resulted in collapse of the rear seat back during crash in november we initiated recall after we discovered single customer owned model with front seat belt that wa not properly connected to the outboard lap pretensioner furthermore in january we implemented firmware update to address issue with certain universal mobile connector nema adapter which are part of the charging unit and are not part of the

affect our brand image in our target market well our business prospect financial condition and result of operation our current and future warranty reserve may be insufficient to cover future warranty claim which could adversely affect our financial performance if our warranty reserve are inadequate to cover future warranty claim on our vehicle our business prospect financial condition and operating result could be materially and adversely affected warranty reserve include management best estimate of the projected cost to repair or to replace item under warranty these estimate are based on actual claim incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and cost of future claim these estimate are inherently uncertain and change to our historical or projected experience may cause material change to our warranty reserve in the future subject to separate limited warranty for the supplemental restraint system and battery we provide four year or mile new vehicle limited warranty for the purchaser of new model and model vehicle the new vehicle limited warranty for model and model also cover the drive unit for eight year and the battery for period of eight year or mile or unlimited mile depending on the size of the vehicle battery although the battery charging capacity is not covered under the new vehicle limited warranty or any extended service plan in addition customer have the opportunity to purchase an extended service plan for the period after the end of the new vehicle limited warranty for model and model to cover additional service for an additional four year or mile provided it is purchased within specified period of time the new vehicle limited warranty and extended service plan for the model and model are subject to certain limitation exclusion or separate warranty including certain wear item such tire brake pad paint and general appearance and battery performance and is intended to cover part and labor to repair defect in material or workmanship in the vehicle including the body chassis suspension interior electronic system powertrain and brake system additionally in part of our ongoing effort to improve the customer ownership experience we expanded the battery pack warranty and also eliminated the annual service requirement that wa needed to keep the new vehicle limited warranty in effect should this change in warranty coverage lead to an increase in warranty claim we may need to record additional warranty reserve which would negatively affect our profitability we are currently expanding and improving our information technology system and use security measure designed to protect our system against breach and cyber attack if these effort are not successful our business and operation could be disrupted and our operating result and reputation could be harmed we are currently expanding and improving our information technology system including implementing new internally developed system to assist in the management of our business in particular our volume production of multiple vehicle necessitates continued development maintenance and improvement of our information technology system in the and abroad which include product data management procurement inventory management production planning and execution sale service and logistics dealer management financial tax and regulatory compliance system the implementation maintenance and improvement of these system require significant management time support and cost moreover there are inherent risk associated with developing improving and expanding our core system well implementing new system including the disruption of our data management procurement manufacturing execution finance supply chain and sale and service process these risk may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory procure part or supply or manufacture sell deliver and service vehicle or achieve and maintain compliance with or realize available benefit under tax law and other applicable regulation we also maintain information technology measure designed to protect against system security risk data breach and cyber attack we can not be sure that these system or their required functionality will be effectively implemented maintained or expanded planned if we do not successfully implement maintain or expand these system planned our operation may be disrupted our ability to accurately and or timely report our financial result could be impaired and deficiency may arise in our internal control over financial reporting which may impact our ability to certify our financial result moreover our proprietary information could be compromised and our reputation may be adversely affected if these system or their functionality do not operate we expect them to we may be required to expend significant resource to make correction or find alternative source for performing these function our insurance strategy may not be adequate to protect from all business risk we may be subject in the ordinary course of business to loss resulting from product liability accident act of god and other claim against for which we may have no insurance coverage while we currently maintain general liability automobile property worker compensation and director and officer insurance policy general matter we do not maintain much insurance coverage many other company do and in some case we do not maintain any at all additionally the policy that we do have may include significant deductible and we can not be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future claim against loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limit may require to pay substantial amount which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating result our financial result may vary significantly from period to period due to fluctuation in our operating cost we expect our period to period operating result to vary based on our operating cost which we anticipate will increase significantly in future period we among other thing design develop and manufacture model tesla energy product and other future product increase the production capacity at our manufacturing facility to produce vehicle at higher volume including ramping up the production of model develop the gigafactory open new tesla service center with maintenance and repair capability open new supercharger location increase our sale and marketing activity and increase our general and administrative function to support our growing operation result of these factor we believe that quarter to quarter comparison of our operating result especially in the short term are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparison can not be relied upon indicator of future performance moreover our operating result may not meet expectation of equity research analyst or investor if any of this occurs the trading price of our stock could fall substantially either suddenly or over time any unauthorized control or manipulation of our vehicle system could result in loss of confidence in and our vehicle and harm our business our vehicle contain complex information technology system for example our vehicle are designed with built in data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote update from to improve or update the functionality of our vehicle we have designed implemented and tested security measure intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology network our vehicle and their system however hacker have reportedly attempted and may attempt in the future to gain unauthorized access to modify alter and use such network vehicle and system to gain control of or to change our vehicle functionality user interface and performance characteristic or to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle we encourage reporting of potential vulnerability in the security of our vehicle via our security vulnerability reporting policy and we aim to remedy any reported and verified vulnerability accordingly we have received report of potential vulnerability in the past and have attempted to remedy them however there can be no assurance that vulnerability will not be identified in the future or that our remediation effort are or will be successful any unauthorized access to or control of our vehicle or their system or any loss of data could result in legal claim or proceeding in addition regardless of their veracity report of unauthorized access to our vehicle their system or data well other factor that may result in the perception that our vehicle their system or data are capable of being hacked could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospect financial condition and operating result if we had desire or need to raise additional fund and could not do so our operation and prospect could be negatively affected we expect that our principal source of liquidity will provide adequate liquidity based on our current plan however if the cost for developing manufacturing and delivering our current or future vehicle exceed our expectation or if we incur any significant unplanned expense or embark on or accelerate new significant strategic investment such the gigafactory we may need to raise additional fund we need sufficient capital to fund our ongoing operation continue research and development project including those for our planned model vehicle establish sale and service center build and deploy supercharger and to make the investment in tooling and manufacturing capital required to introduce new vehicle if we can not raise additional fund on favorable term or at all when we need them our financial condition result of operation business and prospect could be materially adversely affected we may face regulatory limitation on our ability to sell vehicle directly which could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our electric vehicle we sell our vehicle from our tesla store well over the internet we may not be able to sell our vehicle through this sale model in each state in the united state some state have law that may be interpreted to impose limitation on this sale model including law that prohibit manufacturer from selling vehicle directly to consumer without the use of an independent dealership or without physical presence in the state in certain state in which we are not able to obtain dealer license we have worked with state regulator to open gallery which are not full retail location the application of these state law to our operation continues to be difficult to predict law in some state have limited our ability to obtain dealer license from state motor vehicle regulator and may continue to do so in addition decision by regulator permitting to sell vehicle may be subject to challenge to whether such decision comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry law for example vehicle dealer association in new york ohio georgia and massachusetts have filed lawsuit to revoke dealer license issued to these lawsuit have been dismissed and in one court decision the supreme court of massachusetts held that state franchise law like the one in massachusetts do not restrict manufacturer like tesla that doe not use franchised dealer from selling it vehicle directly to consumer such result have reinforced our continuing belief that state law were not designed to prevent our distribution model similar lawsuit ha been filed in missouri possible additional challenge in other state if successful could restrict or prohibit our ability to sell our vehicle to resident in such state in some state there have also been regulatory and legislative effort by vehicle dealer association to propose bill and regulation that if enacted would prevent from obtaining dealer license in their state given our current sale model other state such new jersey new york ohio and pennsylvania have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate but at the same time limit the number of dealer license we can obtain or store that we can operate internationally there may be law in jurisdiction we have not yet entered or law we are unaware of in jurisdiction we have entered that may restrict our sale or other business practice even for those jurisdiction we have analyzed the law in this area can be complex difficult to interpret and may change over time we may need to defend ourselves against patent or trademark infringement claim which may be time consuming and would cause to incur substantial cost company organization or individual including our competitor may hold or obtain patent trademark or other proprietary right that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use develop sell or market our vehicle or component which could make it more difficult for to operate our business from time to time we may receive communication from holder of patent or trademark regarding their proprietary right company holding patent or other intellectual property right may bring suit alleging infringement of such right or otherwise assert their right and urge to take license in addition if we are determined to have infringed upon third party intellectual property right we may be required to do one or more of the following cease selling incorporating certain component into or using vehicle or offering good or service that incorporate or use the challenged intellectual property pay substantial damage seek license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right which license may not be available on reasonable term or at all redesign our vehicle or other good or service or establish and maintain alternative branding for our product and service in the event of successful claim of infringement against and our failure or inability to obtain license to the infringed technology or other intellectual property right our business prospect operating result and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition any litigation or claim whether or not valid could result in substantial cost negative publicity and diversion of resource and management attention our patent application may not result in issued patent which may have material adverse effect on our ability to prevent others from interfering with our commercialization of our product the status of patent involves complex legal and factual question and the breadth and effectiveness of patented claim is uncertain we can not be certain that we are the first creator of invention covered by pending patent application or the first to file patent application on these invention can we be certain that our pending patent application will result in issued patent or that any of our issued patent will afford sufficient protection against someone creating knockoff of our product or defensive portfolio against competitor who claim that we are infringing it patent in addition patent application filed in foreign country are subject to law rule and procedure that differ from those of the united state and thus we can not be certain that foreign patent application will result in issued patent in those foreign jurisdiction or that such patent can be effectively enforced even if they relate to patent issued in the in addition others may obtain patent that we need to take license to or design around either of which would increase cost and may adversely affect our business prospect financial condition and operating result our trademark application in certain country remain subject to outstanding opposition proceeding we have filed trade and service mark application for our tesla mark in various country in which we currently sell and plan to sell our product and service certain of our application are subject to outstanding opposition proceeding brought by owner or applicant alleging prior application for or use of similar mark or refusal issued by trademark office citing prior application or registration for allegedly similar mark if we can not resolve these opposition and refusal and thereby secure registered right in these country the value of the mark representing our exclusive brand name in these country will be diluted in addition there is risk that the prior right owner could in the future take action to challenge our use of the tesla mark in these country such action could have severe impact on our position in these country and may inhibit our ability to use the tesla mark in these country if we were prevented from using the tesla mark in any or all of these country we would need to expend significant additional financial and marketing resource on establishing an alternative brand identity in these market our facility or operation could be damaged or adversely affected result of disaster our corporate headquarters and primary manufacturing facility are all located in northern california region known for seismic activity if major disaster such earthquake or other event occur or our information system or communication network break or operates improperly our headquarters and production facility may be seriously damaged or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our product we may incur expense relating to such damage which could have

selling asset refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on term that may be onerous or highly dilutive our ability to refinance our existing or any future indebtedness will depend on the capital market and our financial condition at such time in addition our ability to make required payment under our indebtedness may be limited by law by regulatory authority or by agreement governing our future indebtedness we may not be able to engage in any of these activity or engage in these activity on desirable term or at all which could result in default on our existing or future

commenced customer delivery of our model in september and are currently ramping production we have delivered over vehicle through december we intend to unveil model lower priced sedan designed for the mass market in the first quarter of and expect to commence production and delivery of this vehicle in late in addition to our automotive product we recently announced the next generation of our energy storage product the kwh and kwh powerwall for residential application and the kwh powerpack for commercial and industrial application we began production and delivery of these product which we will sell under the tesla energy brand in the third quarter of we transitioned the production of these product from the fremont factory to the gigafactory during our primary source of revenue is from the sale of our vehicle during the year ended december we recognized total revenue of billion an increase of million over total revenue of billion for the year ended december primarily driven by growth of model delivery worldwide gross margin for the year ended december wa decrease from for the year ended december we continue to increase our sale and service footprint worldwide and expand our supercharging and destination charging network with the continued global expansion of our customer support and supercharger infrastructure selling general and administrative expense were million for the year ended december compared to million for the year ended december management opportunity challenge and risk vehicle order production and delivery we are currently producing and selling both the model sedan and the model sport utility vehicle we have broadened the appeal of model by introducing new variant that improve range performance and value for those wanting more affordable car we introduced model with starting price of only before incentive and fuel saving our new battery pack option enables almost mile of range at mph finally for our performance enthusiast the new ludicrous mode option improves to mph acceleration to second the introduction of model now provides customer with performance electric vehicle option in the sport utility segment for the first time similar to model we expect to introduce new version and functionality for the model over time overall we expect that demand for our vehicle will continue to increase worldwide more people drive and become aware of our vehicle we grow our customer sale and service infrastructure and we continue to develop our product we have been increasing our production activity and expect to continue to do so in august we began significant production capacity increase at the tesla factory by transitioning to our new final assembly line and upgrading our body center these production capacity increase continued into with further investment including building new paint shop new body shop for model and additional stamping capacity we expect our annual production will increase considerably each year for the next several year in addition scaling our delivery mean that we will have an increasing number of car in transit therefore production will exceed delivery during we achieved significant efficiency in model production and produced vehicle in the fourth quarter of we began production of model in the third quarter of we plan to deliver to new model and model vehicle in in addition to expanding our vehicle production we expect to continue to lower the cost of manufacturing our vehicle over the next several quarter we expect that this trend will contribute to improved automotive gross margin over time excluding the impact of foreign currency movement significant cost improvement for model were achieved in and relating to material cost reduction from both engineering and commercial action and manufacturing efficiency excluding the impact of newly introduced model variant and model however during our product introduction over the last few year we incurred manufacturing inefficiency which negatively impacted our gross margin we expect that automotive gross margin should increase during due to cost reduction for model and improving margin on model our manufacturing efficiency improves for that vehicle supporting our plan to be profitable for the fourth quarter of if we are not able to achieve the planned cost reduction from our various cost saving and process improvement initiative or ramp model efficiently our ability to reach our gross margin goal would be negatively affected in the short term to support our planned vehicle growth in we plan to continue expanding store and service infrastructure worldwide provide more timely service in area with high concentration of tesla customer and continue expanding our supercharger and destination charger network since we now offer our vehicle in many country throughout north america europe and asia our expansion will primarily occur in geographic area in which we already have presence we expect our long term sale outside of north america will be almost half of our worldwide automotive revenue compared to market in the united state we have relatively limited experience in international market and thus we may face difficulty meeting our future international expansion plan if we experience unexpected difficulty or delay in finding and opening desirable location for store and service center we may not be able to meet our delivery plan trend in cash flow capital expenditure and operating expense we expect to see net increase in cash and cash equivalent for the full year we plan to fund about billion in capital expenditure without accessing any outside capital other than our existing source that support our leasing and finished good inventory we plan to invest in equipment to support cell production at the gigafactory begin installation of model vehicle production machinery open about retail location and service center and energize about new supercharger location our operating expense are expected to grow by about in compared to driven primarily by the expansion of our retail and service center well increase in general and administrative cost to support the growth of the business we expect sale general and administrative expense to decline over time percentage of revenue we focus on increasing operational efficiency while continuing to expand our customer and corporate infrastructure over time we also expect total operating expense to decrease percentage of revenue of december and december the net book value of our supercharger network wa million and million and of december included location globally we plan to continue investing in our supercharger network for the foreseeable future including in north america europe and asia and expect such spending to be minimal portion of total capital spending during during this investment will grow our supercharger network by about we allocate supercharger related expense to cost of automotive revenue and selling general and administrative expense these cost were immaterial for all period presented customer financing option we offer loan and lease in north america europe and asia primarily through various financial institution we offer resale value guarantee in connection with certain loan offered by financial institution and of december had approximately vehicle under this program we expanded this program to selected european and asian market during the first half of resale value guarantee available for exercise within the next month total million in value and relate to vehicle vehicle delivery with the resale value guarantee do not impact our near term cash flow and liquidity since we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sale price at delivery however this program requires the deferral of revenue and cost into future period they are considered lease for accounting purpose while we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer if customer exercise the option to return the vehicle to we are exposed to liquidity risk that the resale value of vehicle under these program may be lower than our guarantee or the volume of vehicle returned to may be higher than our estimate or we may be unable to resell the used car in timely manner all of which could adversely impact our cash flow alternatively in case where customer retain their vehicle past the expiration of the guarantee period the remaining deferred revenue and cost will be recognized at no gross profit based on current market demand for our car we estimate the resale price for our vehicle will continue to be above our resale value guarantee amount should market value of our vehicle or customer demand decrease these estimate may be impacted materially we currently offer lease in the directly from our captive financing entity well through leasing partner leasing through tesla finance is now available in state and the district of columbia we also offer financing arrangement through entity in canada germany and uk of december we had leased approximately vehicle through our captive financing entity in the and germany and approximately vehicle through our leasing partner leasing through both our captive financing entity and our leasing partner expose to residual value risk and will adversely impact our near term operating result by requiring the deferral of revenue and cost into future period under lease accounting in addition for lease offered directly from our captive financing entity but not for those offered through our bank partner we will not receive the full amount of the cash for the vehicle price at delivery and will assume customer credit risk we plan to continue expanding our leasing offering the gigafactory we are developing the gigafactory facility where we work together with our supplier to integrate production of battery material cell module and battery pack in one location we broke ground on the gigafactory in june and began assembling our tesla energy product in the first portion of the facility in the fourth quarter of we currently expect to produce cell at this site beginning in for use initially in our tesla energy product and later for our vehicle over the next few year we will continue to invest in the expansion of additional tesla energy production capacity we continue to invest in construction of the building and utility at the gigafactory and in production equipment for battery module and pack production we will be responsible for the overall management of the gigafactory and will engage with partner who have significant experience in battery cell and material production panasonic ha agreed to partner with on the gigafactory with investment in production equipment that it will use to manufacture and supply with battery cell under our arrangement with panasonic we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment at negotiated price these term convey right to use the production related asset defined within asc lease we will consider these leased asset beginning with the start of cell production in given the size and complexity of this undertaking the cost of building and operating the gigafactory could exceed our current expectation we may have difficulty signing up additional partner and the gigafactory may take longer to bring online than we anticipate critical accounting policy and estimate our consolidated financial statement are prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state the preparation of these consolidated financial statement requires to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue cost and expense and related disclosure we base our estimate on historical experience appropriate and on various other assumption that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance change in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period accordingly actual result could differ significantly from the estimate made by our management we evaluate our estimate and assumption on an ongoing basis to the extent that there are material difference between these estimate and actual result our future financial statement presentation financial condition result of operation and cash flow will be affected we believe that the following critical accounting policy involve greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policy accordingly these are the policy we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and result of operation revenue recognition we recognize revenue for product and service when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery ha occurred and there are no uncertainty regarding customer acceptance iii pricing or fee are fixed or determinable and iv collection is reasonably assured vehicle sale include standard feature customer selected option and accessory and specific other element that meet the definition of deliverable under multiple element accounting guidance including free internet connectivity access to our supercharger network and future over the air software update these deliverable are valued on stand alone basis and we recognize their revenue over our performance period which is generally the eight year life of the vehicle except for internet connectivity which is over the free four year period if we sell deliverable separately we use that pricing to determine it fair value otherwise we use our best estimated selling price by considering cost used to develop and deliver the service third party pricing of similar option and other information which may be available vehicle sale to customer with residual value guarantee we offer resale value guarantee or similar buy back term to all customer who purchase vehicle and who finance their vehicle through one of our specified banking partner under this program customer have the option of selling their vehicle back to during the guarantee period for pre determined resale value guarantee period generally range from to month although we receive full payment for the vehicle sale price at the time of delivery we are required to account for these operating lease the amount of sale proceeds equal to the residual value guarantee is deferred until the guarantee expires or is exercised the remaining sale proceeds are deferred and recognized on straight line basis over the stated guarantee period the guarantee period expires at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the pay of the initial loan we capitalize the cost of these vehicle to leased vehicle on our consolidated balance sheet and depreciate their value le salvage value to cost of automotive revenue over the same period in case when customer retains ownership of the vehicle at the end of the guarantee period the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balance related to the vehicle are settled to automotive revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to cost of automotive revenue in case when customer return the vehicle back to during the guarantee period we purchase the vehicle from the customer at an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred balance to automotive revenue and we reclassify the net book value of the vehicle on our balance sheet to pre owned vehicle inventory of december million of guarantee are exercisable by customer within the next twelve month vehicle sale to leasing partner with residual value guarantee in the fourth quarter of we also began offering residual value guarantee in connection with automobile sale to certain bank leasing partner we have guaranteed the value of these vehicle and the vehicle are leased to end customer we account for these transaction interest bearing collateralized borrowing required under asc lease under this program cash is received for the full price of the vehicle and is recorded within resale value guarantee for the long term portion and deferred revenue for the current portion we accrete the deferred revenue amount to automotive revenue on straight line basis over the guarantee period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate we capitalize vehicle under this program to leased vehicle on our consolidated balance sheet and record depreciation from these vehicle to cost of automotive revenue during the period the vehicle is under lease arrangement cash received for these vehicle net of revenue recognized during the period is classified collateralized lease borrowing within cash flow from financing activity in our consolidated statement of cash flow at the end of the lease term we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the residual value guarantee amount or paying shortfall to the guarantee amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle any remaining balance within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive revenue in case where the bank retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our guarantee period we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to cost of automotive revenue the maximum cash we could be required to pay under this program assuming we repurchase of all vehicle under this program is million at december of december and december we had million and million of such borrowing recorded in the resale value guarantee liability and million and million recorded in deferred revenue liability at least annually we ass the estimated market value of vehicle under our resale value guarantee program to determine if we have sustained loss on any of these contract we accumulate more data related to the resale value of our vehicle or market condition change there may be significant change to their estimated value direct vehicle leasing program we offer vehicle leasing program in certain location in the united state canada and germany qualifying customer are permitted to lease vehicle directly from tesla for or month at the end of the lease term customer have the option of either returning the vehicle to or purchasing if for pre determined residual value we account for these leasing transaction operating lease and recognize leasing revenue over the contractual term and record the depreciation of these vehicle to cost of automotive revenue of december and december we had deferred million and million of lease related upfront payment which will be recognized on straight line basis over the contractual term of the individual lease lease revenue are recorded in automotive revenue and for the year ended december and december we recognized million and million maintenance and service plan we offer prepaid maintenance program for our vehicle which includes plan covering maintenance for up to eight year or up to mile provided these service are purchased within specified period of time the maintenance plan cover annual inspection and the replacement of wear and tear part excluding tire and the battery payment collected in advance of the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet and recognized in automotive sale we fulfill our performance obligation we also offer an extended service plan which cover the repair or replacement of vehicle part for an additional four year or up to an additional mile after the end of our initial new vehicle limited warranty provided they are purchased within specified period of time payment collected in advance of the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet and recognized in automotive sale ratably over the service coverage period inventory valuation inventory are stated at the lower of cost or market cost is computed using standard cost which approximates actual cost on first in first out basis we record inventory write down for excess or obsolete inventory based upon assumption about on current and future demand forecast if our inventory on hand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amount are written off we also review inventory to determine whether it carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory this requires to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicle le the estimated cost to convert inventory on hand into finished product once inventory is written down new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent change in fact and circumstance do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis should our estimate of future selling price or production cost change additional and potentially material increase to this reserve may be required small change in our estimate may result in material charge to our reported financial result warranty we provide manufacturer warranty on all vehicle production powertrain component and system and tesla energy product we sell at the time of delivery we accrue for manufacturer warranty which includes our best estimate of the projected cost to repair or to replace item under warranty these estimate are based on actual claim incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and cost of future claim these estimate are inherently uncertain and change to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material change to our warranty reserve in the future the portion of the warranty provision expected to be incurred within month is classified current liability our warranty reserve do not include projected warranty cost associated with our vehicle accounted for operating lease or collateralized debt arrangement cost to repair these vehicle are expensed incurred warranty expense is recorded component of cost of automotive revenue stock based compensation we use the fair value method of accounting for our stock option and restricted stock unit rsus granted to employee and our employee stock purchase plan espp to measure the cost of employee service received in exchange for the stock based award the fair value of stock option and espp are estimated on the grant date and offering date using the black scholes option pricing model the fair value of rsus is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock the resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period which is generally four year for stock option and rsus and six month for the espp stock based compensation expense is recognized on straight line basis net of estimated forfeiture the black scholes option pricing model requires input such the risk free interest rate expected term and expected volatility further the forfeiture rate also affect the amount of aggregate compensation these input are subjective and generally require significant judgment we estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeiture experience and will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience analysis of employee turnover behavior and other factor quarterly change in the estimated forfeiture rate can have significant effect on reported stock based compensation expense the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed if revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate an adjustment is made that will result in decrease to the stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statement if revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statement we accumulate additional employee stock based award data over time and we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatility expected life and forfeiture rate which could materially impact the valuation of our stock based award and the stock based compensation expense that we will recognize in future period stock based compensation expense is recorded in our cost of revenue research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense in august our board of director granted stock option to our ceo ceo grant the ceo grant consists of ten vesting tranche with vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance condition and market condition assuming continued employment and service to through each vesting date each of the vesting tranche requires combination of one of the ten pre determined performance milestone outlined below and an incremental increase in our market capitalization of billion compared to the initial market capitalization of billion measured at the time of the ceo grant successful completion of the model alpha prototype successful completion of the model beta prototype completion of the first model production vehicle successful completion of the model alpha prototype successful completion of the model beta prototype completion of the first model production vehicle gross margin of or more for four consecutive quarter aggregate vehicle production of vehicle aggregate vehicle production of vehicle and aggregate vehicle production of vehicle the term of the ceo grant is ten year so any tranche that remain unvested at the expiration of the ceo grant will be forfeited in addition unvested option will be forfeited if our ceo is no longer in that role whether for cause or otherwise we measured the fair value of the ceo grant using monte carlo simulation approach with the following assumption risk free interest rate of expected term of ten year expected volatility of and dividend yield of stock based compensation expense associated with the ceo grant is recognized for each pair of performance and market condition over the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance and market condition beginning at the point in time that the relevant performance condition is considered probable of being met of december the market condition for seven vesting tranche and the following performance milestone were achieved and approved by our board of director and therefore four of ten tranche of the ceo grant were vested of such date successful completion of the model alpha prototype successful completion of the model beta prototype and completion of the first model production vehicle aggregate vehicle production of vehicle of december the following two performance milestone were considered probable of achievement successful completion of the model alpha prototype and successful completion of the model beta prototype the above three performance milestone were considered probable of achievement we recorded stock based compensation expense of million million and million for the year ended december and additionally no cash compensation ha ever been received by our ceo for his service to the company income tax we are subject to federal and state tax in the united state in many foreign jurisdiction significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income tax our deferred tax asset and liability and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax asset we make these estimate and judgment about our future taxable income that are based on assumption that are consistent with our future plan tax law regulation and administrative practice may be subject to change due to economic or political condition including fundamental change to the tax law applicable to corporate multinationals the many country in the european union and number of other country are actively considering change in this regard of december we had recorded full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset because we expect that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax asset will not be realized in the foreseeable future should the actual amount differ from our estimate the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted furthermore significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax position in the ordinary course of business there are many transaction and calculation for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain result we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attribute based on our estimate of the eventual outcome these effect are recognized when despite our belief that our tax return position are supportable we believe that it is more likely than not that those position may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authority we are required to file income tax return in the united state and various foreign jurisdiction which requires to interpret the applicable tax law and regulation in effect in such jurisdiction such return are subject to audit by the various federal state and foreign taxing authority who may disagree with respect to our tax position we believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit year based on our assessment of many factor including past experience and interpretation of tax law we review and update our estimate in light of changing fact and circumstance such the closing of tax audit the lapse of statute of limitation or change in estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matter differs from our expectation such difference may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made the eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax asset in the period that such determination is made result of operation revenue automotive revenue includes revenue related to delivery of new model and model vehicle including internet connectivity supercharging access and over the air

market price of our common stock for given period exceeds the conversion price of and per share for the note note and note note financial instrument fair value measurement the carrying value of our financial instrument including cash equivalent marketable security account receivable and account payable approximate their fair value due to their short term nature basis for determining the fair value of certain of our asset and liability we established three tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the input used in measuring fair value follows level observable input such quoted price in

from our implied volatility on publicly traded option of our common stock and the historical volatility of our common stock prior to our expected volatility wa derived from our implied volatility on publicly traded option of our common stock and the historical volatility of several unrelated public company within industry related to our business including the automotive oem automotive retail automotive part and battery technology industry because we had limited trading history on our common stock when making the selection of our peer company within industry related to our business to be
