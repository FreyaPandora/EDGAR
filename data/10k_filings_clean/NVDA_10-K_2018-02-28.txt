that provide value to our customer partner and ultimately our shareholder if we fail to anticipate the changing need of our target market and emerging technology trend or if we do not appropriately adapt that strategy market condition evolve in timely manner to exploit potential market opportunity our business will be harmed competition in our current and target market could prevent from growing our revenue our target market remain extremely competitive and we expect competition to intensify current competitor expand their product and or service offering industry standard continue to evolve customer need change and new competitor enter these market our competitor product service and technology may be le costly or may offer superior functionality or better feature than ours which may result among other thing in lower than expected selling price for our product in addition some of our competitor operate and maintain their own fabrication facility have longer operating history larger customer base more comprehensive intellectual property or ip portfolio and patent protection and greater financial sale marketing and distribution resource than we do these competitor may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunity in new market and end user customer trend quickly transition their product including semiconductor product to increasingly smaller line width geometry and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging material which could harm our business if we are unable to successfully compete in our target market respond to change in our target market or introduce new offering to meet the need of this competitive environment including in significant international market such china demand for our product service and technology could decrease which would cause our revenue to decline and cause our result of operation to suffer in addition the competitive landscape in our target market ha changed and may continue to evolve due to trend toward consolidation which could lead to fewer customer partner or supplier any of which could negatively affect our financial result of contentssystem security and data protection breach well cyber attack could disrupt our operation reduce our expected revenue and increase our expense which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation security breach computer malware and cyber attack have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent year these threat are constantly evolving making it increasingly difficult to successfully defend them or implement adequate preventative measure these attack have occurred on our system in the past and are expected to occur in the future experienced computer programmer hacker and employee may penetrate our security control and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of our employee or third party these attack may create system disruption or cause shutdown these hacker may also develop and deploy virus worm and other malicious software program that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerability in our product including consumer and automotive product where we utilize over the air update to improve functionality over time for portion of our it infrastructure including business management and communication software product we rely on product and service provided by third party these provider may also experience breach and attack to their product which may impact our system data security breach may also result from non technical mean such action by an employee with access to our system to defend against security threat both to our internal system and those of our customer we must continuously engineer more secure product and enhance security and reliability feature which may result in increased expense actual or perceived breach of our security measure or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about our partner our customer or third party could expose and the party affected to risk of loss or misuse of this information resulting in litigation and potential liability paying damage regulatory inquiry or action damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business our effort to prevent and overcome these challenge could increase our expense and may not be successful we may experience interruption delay cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customer such disruption could adversely impact our ability to fulfill order and interrupt other critical function delayed sale lower margin or lost customer result of these disruption could adversely affect our financial result stock price and reputation if our product contain significant defect we could incur significant expense to remediate such defect our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market share our product are complex and may contain defect or security vulnerability or experience failure or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issue in design fabrication packaging material and or use within system these risk may increase our product are introduced into new device market technology and application including into the automotive market or new version are released some error in our product or service may only be discovered after product or service ha been shipped or used by customer or the end user of such product undiscovered vulnerability in our product or service could expose our customer or end user to hacker or other unscrupulous third party who develop and deploy virus worm and other malicious software program that could attack our product or service failure of our product to perform to specification or other product defect could lead to substantial damage to the product we sell directly to customer the end product in which our device ha been integrated by oems odms aibs and tier automotive supplier and to the user of such end product any such defect may cause to incur significant warranty support and repair or replacement cost write the value of related inventory cause to lose market share and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development effort to find and correct the issue in addition an error or defect in new product or release or related software driver after commencement of commercial shipment could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design win harm our relationship with customer and partner and harm consumer perception of our brand also we may be required to reimburse our customer partner or consumer including cost to repair or replace product in the field product recall including automotive recall or recall due to bug in our product or significant number of product return could be expensive damage our reputation harm our ability to attract new customer result in the shifting of business to our competitor and result in litigation against such product liability suit if product liability claim is brought against the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the effort of our technical and management personnel and harm our business further our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable term which could adversely impact our financial result we depend on third party and their technology to manufacture assemble test and or package our product which reduces our control over product quantity and quality manufacturing yield development enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business we do not manufacture the silicon wafer used for our gpus and tegra processor and do not own or operate wafer fabrication facility instead we are dependent on industry leading foundry such taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited and samsung electronics co ltd to manufacture our semiconductor wafer using their fabrication equipment and technique similarly we do not directly assemble test or package our product but instead rely on of contentsindependent subcontractor we do not have long term commitment contract with these foundry or subcontractor result we face several significant risk which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand and or negatively impact our business operation gross margin revenue and or financial result including lack of guaranteed supply of wafer and other component and potential higher wafer and component price due to supply constraint failure by our foundry to procure raw material or to provide or allocate adequate or any manufacturing or test capacity for our product failure to develop obtain or successfully implement high quality leading edge process technology including transition to smaller geometry process technology such finfet and memory design such cowos needed to manufacture our product profitably or on timely basis loss of supplier and additional expense and or production delay result of qualifying new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of loss of or decision to add or change supplier lack of direct control over delivery schedule or product quantity and quality and delay in product shipment shortage decrease in product quality and or higher expense in the event our subcontractor or foundry prioritize our competitor order over our order or otherwise in addition low manufacturing yield could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand increase manufacturing cost harm customer or partner relationship and or negatively impact our business operation gross margin revenue and or financial result manufacturing yield for our product are function of product design which is developed largely by and process technology which typically is proprietary to the foundry low yield may result from either product design or process technology failure we do not know whether yield problem will exist our design is actually manufactured by the foundry result yield problem may not be identified until well into the manufacturing process and require and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem we also rely on third party software development tool to assist in the design simulation and verification of new product or product enhancement and to bring such new product and enhancement to market in timely manner in the past we have experienced delay in the introduction of product and enhancement result of the inability of then available software development tool to fully simulate the complex feature and functionality of our product the design requirement necessary to meet consumer demand for more feature and greater functionality from our product may exceed the capability of available software development tool if we miss design cycle or lose design win due to the unavailability of such software development tool we could lose market share and our revenue could decline if we fail to achieve design win for our product our business will be harmed for our product that we do not sell directly to consumer achieving design win is an important success factor achieving design win may involve lengthy process in pursuit of customer opportunity and depend on our ability to anticipate feature and functionality that customer and consumer will demand failure to obtain particular design win may prevent from obtaining design win in subsequent generation of particular product this could result in lost revenue and could weaken our position in future competitive bid selection process unanticipated change in industry standard could render our product incompatible with product developed by major hardware manufacturer and software developer further if our product are not in compliance with prevailing industry standard including safety standard our customer may not incorporate our product into their design strategy winning product design doe not guarantee sale to customer or that we will realize much revenue anticipated if any business disruption could harm our business lead to decline in revenue and increase our cost our worldwide operation could be disrupted by earthquake telecommunication failure power or water shortage outage at cloud service provider tsunami flood hurricane typhoon fire extreme weather condition cyber attack terrorist attack medical epidemic or pandemic and other natural or man made disaster catastrophic event or climate change the occurrence of any of these disruption could harm our business and result in significant loss decline in revenue and an increase in our cost and expense any of these business disruption could require substantial expenditure and recovery time in order to fully resume operation our corporate headquarters and portion of our research and development activity are located in california and other critical business operation and some of our supplier are located in asia near major earthquake fault known for seismic activity in addition majority of our current datacenter capacity is located in california making our operation vulnerable to natural disaster or other business disruption occurring in these geographical area the manufacture of product component the final assembly of our product and other critical operation are concentrated in certain geographic location including taiwan china and korea geopolitical change or change in government regulation and policy in the or abroad also may result in changing regulatory requirement of contentstrade policy and economic disruption that could impact our operating strategy access to global market hiring and profitability catastrophic event can also have an impact on third party vendor who provide critical infrastructure service for it and research and development system and personnel our operation could be harmed if manufacturing logistics or other operation in these location are disrupted for any reason including natural disaster high heat event or water shortage information technology system failure military action or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issue the ultimate impact on our third party foundry and other supplier and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake fault and being consolidated in certain geographical area is unknown in the event major earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event affect or the third party system on which we rely our business could be harmed result of decline in revenue increase in expense substantial expenditure and time spent to fully resume operation if we fail to estimate customer demand properly our financial result could be harmed we manufacture our gpus and tegra processor based on estimate of customer demand and requirement in order to have shorter shipment lead time and quicker delivery schedule for our customer we may build inventory for anticipated period of growth which do not occur or may build inventory anticipating demand for product that doe not materialize in estimating demand we make multiple assumption any of which may prove to be incorrect situation that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include change in business and economic condition including downturn in our target market and or overall economy change in consumer confidence caused by change in market condition including change in the credit market sudden and significant decrease in demand for our product higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirement our introduction of new product resulting in lower demand for older product le demand than expected for newly introduced product or increased competition including competitive pricing action the cancellation or deferral of customer purchase order could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our gross margin in addition because we often sell substantial portion of our product in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitment in timely manner in response to customer cancellation or deferral we could be required to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or market or write off excess inventory and we could experience reduction in average selling price if we incorrectly forecast product demand any of which could harm our financial result conversely if we underestimate our customer demand for our product our foundry partner may not have adequate lead time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customer order on timely basis we may also face supply constraint caused by natural disaster or other event in such case even if we are able to increase production level to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in cost effective or timely manner if we fail to fulfill our customer order on timely basis or at all our customer relationship could be damaged we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged we are subject to risk and uncertainty associated with international operation which may harm our business we conduct our business worldwide and we have office in various country outside of the united state our semiconductor wafer are manufactured assembled tested and packaged by third party located outside of the united state and other america we also generate significant portion of our revenue from sale outside the united state and other america revenue from sale outside of the united state and other america accounted for and of total revenue for fiscal year and respectively additionally of january approximately of our employee were located outside of the united state the global nature of our business subject to number of risk and uncertainty which could have material adverse effect on our business financial

currency fluctuation and increased cost due to imposition of climate change regulation such carbon tax fuel or energy tax and pollution limit if our sale outside of the united state and other america are delayed or cancelled because of any of the factor our revenue may be negatively impacted if we are unable to attract retain and motivate our executive and key employee we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively to be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully we must attract retain and motivate our executive and key employee the market for highly skilled worker and leader in our industry is extremely competitive in particular hiring qualified executive scientist engineer technical staff and research and development personnel is critical to our business additionally change in immigration and work permit law and regulation or the administration or interpretation of such law or regulation could impair our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employee if we are le successful in our recruiting effort or if we can not retain key employee our ability to develop and deliver successful product and service may be adversely affected additionally competition for personnel result in increased cost in the form of cash and stock based compensation the interpretation and application of employment related law to our workforce practice may result in increased operating cost and le flexibility in how we meet our workforce need effective succession planning is also important to our long term success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transition involving key employee could hinder our strategic planning and execution we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefit of business acquisition or strategic investment and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition target which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new product or sell our product we have in the past acquired and invested in and may continue to acquire and invest in other business that offer product service and technology that we believe will help expand or enhance our

disclosure of contingency on an on going basis we evaluate our estimate including those related to revenue recognition inventory income tax goodwill cash equivalent and marketable security stock based compensation and litigation investigation and settlement cost and other contingency we base our estimate on historical experience and on various other assumption that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstance the result of which form the basis for making judgment about the carrying value of asset and liability we believe the following critical accounting policy affect our significant judgment and estimate used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statement our management ha discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policy and estimate with the audit committee of our board of director the audit committee ha reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policy and estimate in this annual report on form revenue recognitionproduct revenuewe recognize revenue from product sale when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product ha been delivered the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured our customer program primarily involve rebate which are designed to serve sale incentive to resellers of our product in various target market we account for rebate reduction of revenue and accrue for of the potential rebate and do not apply breakage factor we typically find that over of the rebate we accrue each year are eventually claimed which is substantially close to and that this percentage varies by program and by customer we recognize liability for these rebate at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate rebate typically expire six month from the date of the original sale unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate unclaimed rebate are reversed to revenue the amount of which typically represents le than of total revenue our customer program also include marketing development fund or mdfs mdfs represent monies paid to our partner that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and are typically designed to support our partner activity while also promoting nvidia product we account for mdfs reduction of revenue and apply breakage factor to certain type of mdf program accrual for which we believe we can make reasonable and reliable estimate of the amount that will ultimately be unclaimed we also record reduction to revenue by establishing sale return allowance for estimated product return at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rate however if product return for particular fiscal period exceed historical return rate we may determine that additional sale return allowance are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product return license and development revenuefor license arrangement that require significant customization of our intellectual property component we generally recognize the related revenue over the period that service are performed for most license and service arrangement we determine progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete the project we periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimate to complete each contract remain accurate revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of project in progress significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total cost any change in or deviation from these estimate could have material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period for license arrangement that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverable over the term of the license agreement we record revenue over the life of the license term with consideration received in advance of the performance period classified deferred revenue refer to note of the note to the consolidated financial statement in part iv item of this annual report on form for additional information of contentsinventoriesinventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or first in first basis we charge cost of sale for inventory provision to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory most of our inventory provision relate to the write off of excess quantity of product based on our inventory level and future product purchase commitment compared to assumption about future demand and market condition situation that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include change in business and economic condition change in market condition sudden and significant decrease in demand for our product inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirement failure to estimate customer demand properly or unexpected competitive pricing action by our competition in addition cancellation or deferral of customer purchase order could result in our holding excess inventory the overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provision and sale of item previously written down wa insignificant in fiscal year and and an unfavorable impact of in fiscal year the charge we took to cost of sale for inventory provision during these fiscal year were primarily related to the write off of excess quantity of product whose inventory level were higher than our updated forecast of future demand for those product fable semiconductor company we must make commitment to purchase inventory based on forecast of future customer demand in doing so we must account for our third party manufacturer lead time and constraint we also adjust to other market factor

attributable to temporary difference and carryforwards and we record valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax asset by the amount of any tax benefit that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized our calculation of deferred tax asset and liability is based on certain estimate and judgment and involves dealing with uncertainty in the application of complex tax law our estimate of deferred tax asset and liability may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome change in accounting standard or tax law in the united state or foreign jurisdiction where we operate or change in other fact or circumstance in addition we recognize liability for potential united state and foreign income tax contingency based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax may be due if we determine that payment of these amount is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is le than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statement accordingly of january we had valuation allowance of million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax asset that management determined are not likely to be realized due to projection of future taxable income and potential utilization limitation of tax attribute acquired result of stock ownership change to the extent realization of the deferred tax asset becomes more likely than not we would recognize such deferred tax asset an income tax benefit during the period we recognize the benefit from tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merit of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalty related to unrecognized tax benefit component of income tax expense the tcja which wa enacted in december significantly change tax law including reduction of the federal corporate

preparation of financial statement in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset and liability and disclosure of contingent asset and liability at the date of the financial statement and the reported amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period actual result could differ materially from our estimate on an on going basis we evaluate our estimate including those related to revenue recognition cash equivalent and marketable security account receivable inventory income tax goodwill stock based compensation litigation investigation and settlement cost restructuring and other charge and other contingency these estimate are based on historical fact and various other assumption that we believe are reasonable revenue recognitionproduct revenuewe recognize revenue from product sale when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product ha been delivered the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured for most sale we use binding purchase order and in certain case we use contractual agreement evidence of an arrangement we consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer at the point of sale we ass whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured if we determine that collection of fee is not reasonably assured we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured which is generally upon receipt of payment our customer program primarily involve rebate which are designed to serve sale incentive to resellers of our product in various target market we account for rebate reduction of revenue and accrue for of the potential rebate and do not apply breakage factor we typically find that over of the rebate we accrue each year are eventually claimed which is substantially close to and that this percentage varies by program and by customer we recognize liability for these rebate at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate rebate typically expire six month from the date of the original sale unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate unclaimed rebate are reversed to revenue the amount of which typically represents le than of total revenue our customer program also include marketing development fund or mdfs mdfs represent monies paid to our partner that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and are typically designed to support our partner of contentsnvidia corporation and subsidiariesnotes to the consolidated financial statement continued activity while also promoting nvidia product we account for mdfs reduction of revenue and apply breakage factor to certain type of mdf program accrual for which we believe we can make reasonable and reliable estimate of the amount that will ultimately be unclaimed we also record reduction to revenue by establishing sale return allowance for estimated product return at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rate however if product return for particular fiscal period exceed historical return rate we may determine that additional sale return allowance are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product return license and development revenuefor license arrangement that require significant customization of our intellectual property component we generally recognize the related revenue over the period that service are performed for most license and service arrangement we determine progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete the project provision for estimated loss on contract is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated cost incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded deferred cost on uncompleted contract if the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized the excess amount is recorded deferred revenue for license arrangement that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverable over the term of the license agreement we record revenue over the life of the license term with consideration received in advance of the performance period classified deferred revenue royalty revenue is recognized related to the distribution or sale of product that use our technology under license agreement with third party we recognize royalty revenue upon receipt of confirmation of earned royalty and when collectability is reasonably assured from the applicable licensee advertising expenseswe expense advertising cost in the period in which they are incurred advertising expense for fiscal year and were million million and million respectively rent expensewe recognize rent expense on straight line basis over the lease period and accrue for rent expense incurred but not paid product warrantieswe generally offer limited warranty to end user that range from one to three year for product in order to repair or replace product for any manufacturing defect or hardware component failure cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranty that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition under limited circumstance we may offer an extended limited warranty to customer for certain product we also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issue if loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated stock based compensationwe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant minus dividend yield discount the fair value of award of restricted stock unit or rsus and performance stock unit that are based on our corporate financial performance target or psus we use monte carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock unit that are based on market condition or market based psus the compensation expense for rsus and market based psus is recognized using straight line attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for psus is recognized using an accelerated amortization model we estimate the fair value of share to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan or espp using the black scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in march and september of each year stock based compensation for our espp is expensed using an accelerated amortization model additionally we estimate forfeiture annually based on historical experience and revise the estimate of forfeiture in subsequent period if actual forfeiture differ from those estimate if factor change the compensation expense that we record under these accounting standard may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period of contentsnvidia corporation and subsidiariesnotes to the consolidated financial statement continued restructuring and other charge our restructuring and other charge include employee severance and related cost the write down of asset and other exit cost the severance and related cost include one time termination benefit well certain statutory termination benefit or employee termination under ongoing benefit arrangement one time termination benefit are recognized liability at estimated fair value when the approved plan of termination ha been communicated to employee unless employee must provide future service in which case the benefit are recognized ratably over the future service period ongoing termination benefit arrangement are recognized liability at estimated fair value when the amount of such benefit becomes estimable and payment is probable any contract termination cost are recognized at estimated fair value when we terminate the contract in accordance with the contract term other associated cost are recognized in the period the liability is incurred our operating expense for fiscal year included million of restructuring and other charge related to the wind down of our icera operation which wa comprised mainly of employee severance facility and related cost restructuring charge were not significant for fiscal year and litigation investigation and settlement costsfrom time to time we are involved in legal action and or investigation by regulatory body we are aggressively defending our current litigation matter however there are many uncertainty associated with any litigation or investigation and we can not be certain that these action or other third party claim against will be resolved without litigation fine and or substantial settlement payment if that occurs our business financial condition and result of operation could be materially and adversely affected if information becomes available that cause to determine that loss in any of our pending litigation investigation or settlement is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such event we will record the loss in accordance with gaap however the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimate which could require to record additional cost foreign currency remeasurementwe use the united state dollar our functional currency for all of our subsidiary foreign currency monetary asset and liability are remeasured into united state dollar at end of period exchange rate non monetary asset and liability such property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rate revenue and expense are remeasured at average exchange rate in effect during each period except for those expense related to the previously noted balance sheet amount which are remeasured at historical exchange rate gain or loss from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense in our consolidated statement of income and to date have not been significant income taxeswe recognize federal state and foreign current tax liability or asset based on our estimate of tax payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax asset or liability appropriate for our estimate of future tax effect attributable to temporary difference and carryforwards and we record valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax asset by the amount of any tax benefit that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized our calculation of deferred tax asset and liability is based on certain estimate and judgment and involves dealing with uncertainty in the application of complex tax law our estimate of deferred tax asset and liability may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome change in accounting standard or tax law in the united state or foreign jurisdiction where we operate or change in other fact or circumstance in addition we recognize liability for potential united state and foreign income tax contingency based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax may be due if we determine that payment of these amount is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is le than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statement accordingly of january we had valuation allowance of million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax asset that management determined are not likely to be realized due to projection of future taxable income and potential utilization limitation of tax attribute acquired result of stock ownership change to the extent realization of the deferred tax asset becomes more likely than not we would recognize such deferred tax asset an income tax benefit during the period of contentsnvidia corporation and subsidiariesnotes to the consolidated financial statement continued we recognize the benefit from tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merit of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalty related to unrecognized tax benefit component of income tax expense in december the tax cut and job act or tcja wa enacted into law the tcja significantly change tax law including reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate from to

when their effect is anti dilutive additionally we issued convertible note with net settlement feature that requires upon conversion to settle the principal amount of debt for cash and the conversion premium for cash or share of our common stock our convertible note note hedge and related warrant contain various conversion feature which are further described in note of these note to the consolidated financial statement the potentially dilutive share resulting from the convertible note and warrant under the treasury stock method will be included in the calculation of diluted income

required to sell the instrument before recovery of it amortized cost basis or credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument in these situation we recognize an other than temporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instrument amortized cost basis and it fair value for available for sale debt instrument

based on overall estimated exposure our overall estimated exposure excludes amount covered by credit insurance and letter of credit account receivablewe maintain an allowance for doubtful account receivable for estimated loss resulting from the inability of our customer to make required payment we determine this allowance by identifying amount for specific customer issue well amount based on

final test yield fallout and shipping cost well the cost of purchased memory product and other component part we charge cost of sale for inventory provision to write down our inventory to the lower of

purpose of completing our impairment test we perform either qualitative or quantitative analysis on reporting unit basis for those reporting unit where significant change or event ha occurred where potential impairment indicator exist or for which we have not performed quantitative assessment recently we perform quantitative assessment to testing goodwill for impairment it test for possible impairment by applying fair value based test by weighting the result from the income approach and the market approach refer to note of these note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information intangible asset and other long lived assetsintangible asset primarily represent right acquired under technology license patent acquired intellectual property trademark and customer relationship and are subject to an annual impairment test we currently amortize our intangible asset with definitive life over period ranging from three to ten year using method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefit of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or if that pattern can not be reliably determined using straight line amortization method long lived asset such property and equipment and intangible asset subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or

expected to be generated by the asset or asset group if the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds it estimated future cash flow an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flow expected to be generated by the asset or asset group asset and liability to be disposed of would be separately presented in the consolidated balance sheet and the asset would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value le cost to sell and would no longer be depreciated adoption of new and recently issued accounting pronouncementsrecently adopted accounting pronouncementsin october the financial accounting standard board or fasb issued an accounting standard update which requires the recognition of income tax consequence of an intra entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs we elected to early adopt this new guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year which required to reflect any adjustment of january upon adoption of this guidance we recorded cumulative effect adjustment of the first day of fiscal year to decrease retained earnings by million with corresponding decrease to prepaid tax that had not been previously recognized in income tax expense in january the fasb issued an accounting standard update that simplifies the test for goodwill impairment the update eliminates the second step in the goodwill impairment test that requires an entity to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill instead an entity should recognize an impairment loss if the carrying value of the net asset assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit with the impairment loss not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit we adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and applied it prospectively permitted by the standard the adoption of this accounting guidance did not have material impact on our consolidated financial statement recent accounting pronouncement not yet adopted in january the fasb issued an accounting standard update to amend certain aspect of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instrument most prominent among the amendment is the requirement for change in the fair value of our equity investment to be recognized through net income rather than other comprehensive income the update will be effective for beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year we anticipate the adoption of this accounting standard to increase the volatility of our other income or expense net due to the remeasurement of certain of our equity security primarily our investment in non affiliate for fair value change of contentsnvidia corporation and subsidiariesnotes to the consolidated financial statement continued in february the fasb issued an accounting standard update regarding the accounting for lease by which we will begin recognizing lease asset and liability on the balance sheet for lease with lease term of more than month the update will require additional disclosure regarding key information about leasing arrangement under existing guidance operating lease are not recorded lease asset and lease liability on the balance sheet the update will be effective for beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year with early adoption permitted we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statement however we expect the adoption of this accounting guidance to result in an increase in lease asset and corresponding increase in lease liability on our consolidated balance sheet the fasb issued an accounting standard update that creates single source of revenue guidance under gaap for all company in all industry we expect to adopt this guidance beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year using the modified retrospective approach we have made progress in and continue to ass change in policy process system and control necessary to meet the additional requirement of the guidance while we are still finalizing our analysis to quantify the adoption impact of the provision of the new revenue standard we do not expect it to have material impact on our consolidated financial statement however we do expect to provide additional disclosure under this guidance including more information regarding estimate and judgment practical expedient used contract balance and performance obligation note stock based compensationour stock based compensation expense is associated with stock option restricted stock unit or rsus performance stock unit

granting rsus psus and market based psus to reflect changing market trend for equity incentive at our peer company of january there were million stock option outstanding and the amount of unvested stock option wa not significant the number of psus that will ultimately vest is contingent on the company level of achievement versus the corporate financial performance target established by our compensation committee in the beginning of each fiscal year of the total fair value of equity award we estimated that the stock based compensation expense related to the equity award that are not expected to vest for fiscal year and wa million million and million respectively january january in million aggregate unearned stock based compensation expense estimated weighted average remaining amortization period in year rsus psus and market based fair value of share issued under our espp have been estimated with the following assumption year ended january january january using the black scholes model espp weighted average expected life in year free interest dividend for espp share the expected term represents the average term from the first day of the offering period to the purchase date the risk free interest rate assumption used to value espp share is based upon observed interest rate on treasury bill appropriate for the expected term our expected stock price volatility assumption for espp is estimated using historical volatility for award granted we use the dividend yield at grant date our rsu psu and market based psu award are not eligible for cash dividend prior to vesting therefore the fair value of rsus psus and market based psus are discounted for the dividend yield additionally for employee stock option rsu psu and market based psu award we estimate forfeiture annually and revise the estimate of forfeiture in subsequent period if actual forfeiture differ from those estimate forfeiture are estimated based on historical experience equity incentive
