some risk that apply more specifically to our business our revenue is concentrated with the government this customer relationship involves some specific risk in addition our sale to non customer expose to different financial and legal risk despite the varying nature of our and non defense and business aviation operation and the market they serve each group share some common risk such the ongoing development of high technology product and the price availability and quality of commodity and subsystem the government provides significant portion of our revenue percent of our consolidated revenue in wa from the government level of defense spending are driven by threat to national security competing demand for federal fund pressure various area of spending decrease in government defense spending or change in spending allocation or priority could result in one or more of our program reduced delayed or terminated which could impact our financial performance for additional information relating to the defense budget see the business environment section of management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation in item government contract are not always fully funded at inception and any funding is subject to disruption or delay our government revenue is funded by agency budget that operate on an october to september fiscal year early each calendar year the president of the united state present to congress the budget for the upcoming fiscal year this budget proposes funding level for every federal agency and is the result of month of policy and program review throughout the executive branch for the remainder of the year the appropriation and authorization committee of congress review the president budget proposal and establish the funding level for the upcoming fiscal year these level are enacted into law the executive office of the president administers the fund to the agency there are two primary risk associated with the government budget cycle first the annual process may be delayed or disrupted which ha occurred in recent year for example change in congressional schedule due to election or other legislative priority or negotiation for program funding level can interrupt the process if the annual budget is not approved by the beginning of the government fiscal year portion of the government can shut or operate under continuing resolution that maintains spending at prior year level which can impact funding for our program and timing of new award second congress typically appropriates fund on fiscal year basis even though contract performance may extend over many year future revenue under existing multi year contract is conditioned on the continuing availability of congressional appropriation change in appropriation in subsequent year may impact the funding available for these program delay or change in funding can impact the timing of available fund or lead to change in program content our government contract are subject to termination right by the customer government contract generally permit the government to terminate contract in whole or in part for convenience if contract is terminated for convenience contractor usually is entitled to receive payment for it allowable cost incurred and the proportionate share of fee or earnings for the work performed the government may also terminate contract for default in the event of breach by the contractor if contract is terminated default the government in most case pay only for the work it ha accepted the termination of multiple or large program could have material adverse effect on our future revenue and earnings government contractor operate in highly regulated environment and are subject to audit by the government numerous government agency routinely audit and review government contractor these agency review contractor performance under it contract and compliance with applicable law regulation and standard the government also review the adequacy of and compliance with internal control system and policy including the contractor purchasing property estimating material earned value management and accounting system in some case audit may result in delayed payment or contractor cost not being reimbursed or subject to repayment if an audit or investigation were to result in allegation against contractor of improper or illegal activity civil or criminal penalty and administrative sanction could result including termination of contract forfeiture of profit suspension of payment fine and suspension or prohibition from business with the government in addition reputational harm could result if allegation of impropriety were made in some case audit may result in dispute with the respective government agency that can result in negotiated settlement arbitration or litigation moreover new law regulation or standard or change to existing one can increase our performance and compliance cost and reduce our profitability our aerospace group is subject to changing customer demand for business aircraft the business jet market is driven by the demand for business aviation product and service by business individual and government customer in the united state and around the world the aerospace group result also depend on other factor including general economic condition the availability of credit pricing pressure and trend in capital good market in addition if customer default on existing contract and the contract are not replaced the group anticipated revenue and profitability could be reduced materially earnings and margin depend on our ability to perform on our contract when agreeing to contractual term our management team make assumption and projection about future condition and event the accounting for our contract and program requires assumption and estimate about these condition and event these projection and estimate ass the productivity and availability of labor the complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of material and component and schedule requirement if there is significant change in one or more of these circumstance estimate or assumption or if the risk under our contract are not managed adequately the profitability of contract could be adversely affected this could affect earnings and margin materially earnings and margin depend in part on subcontractor and vendor performance we rely on other company to provide material component and subsystem for our product subcontractor also perform some of the service that we provide to our customer we depend on these subcontractor and vendor to meet our contractual obligation in full compliance with customer requirement and applicable law misconduct by subcontractor such failure to comply with procurement regulation or engaging in unauthorized activity may harm our future revenue and earnings we manage our supplier base carefully to avoid customer issue we sometimes rely on only one or two source of supply that if disrupted could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our customer commitment our ability to perform our obligation may be materially adversely affected if one or more of these supplier is unable to provide the agreed upon supply perform the agreed upon service in timely and cost effective manner or engages in misconduct or other improper activity and operation outside the united state are subject to different risk that may be associated with doing business in foreign country in some country there is increased chance for economic legal or political change and procurement procedure may be le robust or mature which may complicate the contracting process our non business may be sensitive to change in foreign government budget leadership and national priority which may occur suddenly non transaction can involve increased financial and legal risk arising from foreign exchange rate variability and differing legal system our non business is subject to and foreign law and regulation including law and regulation relating to import export control technology transfer the foreign corrupt practice act and other anti corruption law and the international traffic in arm regulation itar an unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factor or failure to comply with or foreign law could result in administrative civil or criminal liability including suspension or debarment from government contract or suspension of our export privilege and could materially adversely affect revenue and earnings associated with our non business in addition some non government customer require contractor to enter into letter of credit performance or surety bond bank guarantee and other similar financial arrangement we may also be required to agree to specific in country purchase manufacturing agreement or financial support arrangement known offset that require to satisfy investment or other requirement or face penalty offset requirement may extend over several year and could require to team with local company to fulfill these requirement if we do not satisfy these financial or offset requirement our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected our future success depends in part on our ability to develop new product and technology and maintain qualified workforce to meet the need of our customer many of the product and service we provide involve sophisticated technology and engineering with related complex manufacturing and system integration process our customer requirement change and evolve regularly accordingly our future performance depends in part on our ability to continue to develop manufacture and provide innovative product and service and bring those offering to market quickly at cost effective price some new product particularly in our aerospace group must meet extensive and time consuming regulatory requirement that are often outside our control additionally due to the highly specialized nature of our business we must hire and retain the skilled and qualified personnel necessary to perform the service required by our customer if we were unable to develop new product that meet customer changing need and satisfy regulatory requirement in timely manner or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected we have made and expect to continue to make investment including acquisition and joint venture that involve risk and uncertainty when evaluating potential acquisition and joint venture we make judgment regarding the value of business opportunity technology and other asset and the risk and cost of potential liability based on information available to at the time of the transaction whether we realize the anticipated benefit from these transaction depends on multiple factor including our integration of the business involved the performance of the underlying product capability or technology market condition following the acquisition and acquired liability including some that may not have been identified prior to the acquisition these factor could materially adversely affect our financial result change in business condition may cause goodwill and other intangible asset to become impaired goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net

included in item business environmentwith percent of our revenue from the government our financial performance is impacted by government spending level particularly defense spending over the past several year defense spending ha been mandated by the budget control act of bca the bca establishes spending cap over year period through the fiscal year fy budget request for the department of defense dod total billion which includes billion in the base budget in compliance with the bca well billion for overseas contingency operation the budget request represents slight increase over fy spending level congress ha not yet passed the fy defense appropriation bill and on december continuing resolution cr which fund government agency at fy spending level wa approved through april to prevent detrimental change or delay to certain government program the cr included exception that provide funding flexibility and additional appropriation for certain program including the columbia class submarine program we do not anticipate that the current cr will have material impact on our operating result in the long term outlook for our defense business is influenced by the relevance of our program to the military funding priority the diversity of our program and customer our insight into customer requirement stemming from our incumbency on core program our ability to evolve our product to address fast changing threat environment and our proven track record of successful contract execution we continue to pursue international opportunity presented by demand for military equipment and information technology from our non operation and through export from our north american business while the revenue potential can be significant these opportunity are subject to changing budget priority and overall spending pressure unique to each country in our aerospace group business jet order reflected demand across our product portfolio we expect our continued investment in the development of new aircraft product and technology to support the aerospace group long term growth similarly we believe the aircraft service business will continue to be strong source of revenue the global business jet fleet grows in navigating the current business environment we continue to focus on improving operating earnings expanding margin and the efficient conversion of earnings into cash we emphasize effective program execution anticipate trend and react to changing circumstance in our business environment and look for opportunity to drive cost reduction activity across our business of operationsintroductionan understanding of our accounting practice is important to evaluate our financial statement and operating result we recognize the majority of our revenue using the percentage of completion method of accounting the following paragraph explain how this method is applied in recognizing revenue and operating cost in our business group for the period reported in this form in the aerospace group contract for new aircraft have two major phase the manufacture of the green aircraft and the aircraft outfitting which includes exterior painting and installation of customer selected interior we record revenue on these contract at the completion of these two phase when green aircraft are completed and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the outfitted aircraft we do not recognize revenue at green delivery unless contract ha been executed with the customer and the customer can be expected to satisfy it obligation under the contract evidenced by the receipt of deposit from the customer and other factor revenue associated with the group completion of other original equipment manufacturer oems aircraft and the group service business are recognized work progress or upon delivery of service fluctuation in revenue from period to period result from the number and mix of new aircraft delivery green and outfitted progress on aircraft completion and the level of aircraft service activity during the period the majority of the aerospace group operating cost relates to new aircraft production on firm order and consists of labor material subcontractor and overhead cost the cost are accumulated in production lot recorded in inventory and recognized operating cost at green aircraft delivery based on the estimated average unit cost in production lot while change in the estimated average unit cost for production lot impact the level of operating cost the amount of operating cost reported in given period is based largely on the number and type of aircraft delivered operating cost in the aerospace group completion and service business are recognized generally incurred for new aircraft operating earnings and margin are function of the price of our aircraft our operational efficiency in manufacturing and outfitting the aircraft and the mix of higher margin large cabin and lower margin mid cabin aircraft delivery additional factor affecting the group earnings and margin include the volume mix and profitability of completion and service work performed the volume of and market for pre owned aircraft and the level of general and administrative and net research and development cost incurred by the group in the three defense group revenue on our long term government contract is recognized the work progress either product are produced or service are rendered result variation in revenue are discussed generally in term of volume typically measured by the level of activity on individual contract or program year over year variance attributed to volume are due to change in production or service level and delivery schedule operating cost for the defense group consist of labor material subcontractor overhead and cost and are recognized generally incurred variance in cost recognized from period to period reflect primarily increase and decrease in production or activity level on individual contract and therefore result largely from the same factor that drive variance in revenue operating earnings and margin in the defense group are driven by change in volume performance or contract mix performance refers to change in profitability based on adjustment to estimate at completion on individual contract these adjustment result from increase or decrease to the estimated value of the contract the estimated cost to complete or both therefore change in cost incurred in the compared with prior period do not necessarily impact profitability it is only when total estimated cost at completion on given contract change without corresponding change in the contract value that the profitability of that contract may be impacted contract mix refers to change in the volume of higher lower margin work additionally higher or lower margin can be inherent in the contract type fixed price cost reimbursable or type of work development production consolidated overview in review

operating cost and operating operating operating earnings and margin increased in on essentially flat revenue compared with continuing trend of superb operating performance our volume reflects fewer aircraft delivery in our aerospace group offset largely by higher navy engineering and ship construction work in our marine system group and command control communication computer intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance solution volume in our information system and technology group operating cost and expense decreased at greater rate than revenue resulting in positive operating

quarter of we recognized an loss net of tax to adjust the previously recognized settlement value in addition we recognized loss net of tax in the fourth quarter of related to an environmental matter associated with former operation of the company in we entered into an agreement to sell our axle business in the combat system group and recognized loss net of tax the sale wa completed in january in the first quarter of we recognized final adjustment of to the loss on the sale of this business see note to the consolidated financial statement in item for further discussion of these transaction outlookour outlook ha been developed under accounting standard codification asc topic revenue from contract with customer which we adopted on january we have assessed our and operating result under asc topic outlined in the table that follows the impact of asc topic on our and operating result may or may not be representative of the impact on subsequent year result described in the application of critical accounting policy discussion aircraft manufacturing revenue in our aerospace group will be recognized when control is transferred to the customer generally at customer acceptance and final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft additionally use of the cumulative catch up method of recognizing adjustment in estimated profit on our long term contract will require to recognize the total impact of an adjustment in the period it is identified rather than prospectively over the remaining contract term we have in the past revenue recognition accounting change of january restated revenuerestated operating earningsyear ended december system and total following outlook for each of our business group is compared with the restated operating result under the new standard shown in the table above aerospace we expect the aerospace group revenue to be up about percent from operating margin is expected to be in the low percent range combat system we expect the combat system group revenue to increase between and percent in operating margin is expected to be in the mid percent range information system and technology we expect the information system and technology group revenue

commission that allows to access the debt market non gaap management metricswe emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder return described below we use free cash flow and roic to measure our performance in area while we believe these metric provide useful information they are not defined operating measure under generally accepted accounting principle gaap and there are limitation associated with their use our calculation of these metric may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measure of other company due to potential difference in the method of calculation result the use of these metric should not be considered in isolation from or substitute for other gaap measure free cash flow we define free cash flow from operation net cash provided by operating activity le capital expenditure we believe free cash flow from operation is useful measure for investor because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our business for purpose such repaying maturing debt funding business acquisition repurchasing our common stock and paying dividend we use free cash flow from operation to ass the quality of our earnings and key performance measure in evaluating management the following table reconciles the free cash flow from operation with net cash provided by operating activity classified on the consolidated statement of cash flow year ended december cash provided by operating activity expenditure free cash flow from operation flow percentage of earnings from continuing operation net cash provided by operating nm free cash flow from nm not meaningful nm due to net loss in discussed previously the decrease in free cash flow from operation in and is due primarily to growth in operating working capital in our aerospace and combat system group return on invested capital we believe roic is useful measure for investor because it reflects our ability to generate return from the capital we have deployed in our operation we use roic to evaluate investment decision and performance measure in evaluating management we define roic net operating profit after tax divided by average invested capital net operating profit after tax is defined earnings from continuing operation plus after tax interest and amortization expense average invested capital is defined the sum of the average debt and shareholder equity for the year roic excludes accumulated other comprehensive loss goodwill impairment and non economic accounting change they are not reflective of our operating performance roic

government contract under which we would expect full recourse under normal contract termination clause represents other long term liability on our consolidated balance sheet including the current portion of these liability the projected timing of cash flow associated with these obligation is based on management estimate which are based largely on historical experience this amount also includes all liability under our defined benefit retirement plan see note to the consolidated financial statement in item for information regarding these liability and the plan asset available to satisfy them amount of commitment expiration by periodcommercial commitmentstotal amount committed le than year year year more than yearsletters of credit and guarantee see note to the consolidated financial statement in item for discussion of letter of credit application of critical accounting policiesmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation is based on our consolidated financial statement which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statement in accordance with gaap requires that we make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset and liability and the disclosure of contingent asset and liability at the date of the financial statement well the reported amount of revenue and expense during the period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimate including most pervasively those related to various assumption and projection for our long term contract and program other significant estimate include those related to goodwill and other intangible asset income tax pension and other post retirement benefit worker compensation warranty obligation and litigation and other contingency we employ judgment in making our estimate but they are based on historical experience currently available information and various other assumption that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance the result of these estimate form the basis for making judgment about the carrying value of asset and liability that are not readily available from other source actual result may differ from these estimate believe that our judgment is applied consistently and produce financial information that fairly depicts the result of operation for all period presented in our opinion the following policy are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application revenue recognitionwe account for revenue and earnings using the percentage of completion method under this method we recognize contract cost and revenue the work progress either the product are produced or service are rendered we determine progress using either input measure cost incurred or output measure contract milestone or unit delivered appropriate to the circumstance an input measure is used in most case unless an output measure is identified that is reliably determinable and representative of progress toward completion we estimate the profit on contract the difference between the total estimated revenue and expected cost to complete contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract if at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on the contract we recognize the loss in the quarter it is identified we generally measure progress toward completion on contract in our defense business based on the proportion of cost incurred to date relative to total estimated cost at completion for our contract for the manufacture of business jet aircraft we record revenue at two contractual milestone when green aircraft are completed and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft we do not recognize revenue at green delivery unless contract ha been executed with the customer and the customer can be expected to satisfy it obligation under the contract evidenced by the receipt of deposit from the customer and other factor accounting for long term contract and program involves the use of various technique to estimate total contract revenue and cost contract estimate are based on various assumption to project the outcome of future event that often span several year these assumption include labor productivity and availability the complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of material the performance of subcontractor and the availability and timing of funding from the customer we include in our contract estimate additional revenue for submitted contract modification or claim against the customer when the amount can be estimated reliably and it realization is probable in evaluating these criterion we consider the contractual legal basis for the claim the cause of any additional cost incurred the reasonableness of those cost and the objective evidence available to support the claim we include award or incentive fee in the estimated contract value when there is basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee estimate of award or incentive fee are based on historical award experience and anticipated performance these estimate are based on our best judgment at the time significant change in one or more of these estimate could affect the profitability of our contract we review and update our contract related estimate regularly we recognize adjustment in estimated profit on contract under the reallocation method under the reallocation method the impact of an adjustment in estimate is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term the net impact of adjustment in contract estimate on our operating earnings and on diluted per share basis totaled favorable adjustment of in in and in no adjustment on any one contract wa material to our consolidated financial statement in or consistent with industry practice we classify asset and liability related to long term contract current even though some of these amount may not be realized within one year all contract are reported on the consolidated balance sheet in net asset contract in process or liability customer advance and position on contract by contract basis at the end of each reporting period our government customer generally asserts title to or security interest in inventoried cost related to such contract result of advance and progress payment we reflect these advance and progress payment an offset to the related inventoried cost change in revenue recognition standard adoption of asc topic we adopted asc topic revenue from contract with customer on january the standard outline five step model whereby revenue is recognized performance obligation within contract are satisfied the standard also requires new expanded disclosure regarding revenue recognition we adopted the new standard using the retrospective transition method implementation plan because the new standard impacted our business process system and control we developed comprehensive change management project plan to guide the implementation which commenced in this project plan included analyzing the standard impact on our contract portfolio comparing our historical accounting policy and practice to the requirement of the new standard and identifying difference from applying the requirement of the new standard to our contract we developed internal control to ensure that we adequately evaluated our portfolio of contract under the five step model to ensure proper assessment of our operating result under asc topic we reported on the progress of the implementation to the audit committee and the board of director on regular basis during the project duration asc topic impact the majority of our long term contract will continue to recognize revenue and earnings over time the work progress because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer generally using an input measure cost incurred to reflect progress the adoption of asc topic will have two primary impact on our portfolio of contract and our consolidated financial statement we will be precluded from using the reallocation method of recognizing adjustment in estimated profit on contract the total impact of an adjustment in estimated profit recorded to date on contract will be recognized in the period it is identified cumulative catch up method rather than recognizing the impact of an adjustment prospectively over the remaining contract term result adjustment in contract estimate may be larger and likely more variable from period to period particularly on our contract of greater value and with longer performance period for example in our marine system group despite this variability contract cash flow and overall profitability at completion are the same under the cumulative catch up method and the reallocation method anticipated loss on contract will continue to be recognized in the quarter they are identified for our contract for the manufacture of business jet aircraft in the aerospace group we will record revenue under asc topic at single point in time when control is transferred to the customer generally when the customer accepts the fully outfitted aircraft asc topic will not change the total revenue or operating earnings recognized for each aircraft only the timing of when those amount are recognized prior to the adoption of asc topic we recorded revenue for these contract at two contractual milestone when green aircraft were completed and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepted final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft numerous other contract in our portfolio were impacted by asc topic due primarily to the identification of multiple performance obligation within single contract on our consolidated balance sheet long term contract will continue to be reported in net contract asset contract in process or contract liability customer advance and deposit position on contract by contract basis at the end of each reporting period business jet component in our aerospace group will be reported in inventory until control of the aircraft transfer to the customer the assessment of our consolidated balance sheet under asc topic will result in some reclassification among financial statement account but these reclassification will not materially change the total amount of net asset of december see note to the consolidated financial statement in item for additional information regarding our adoption of asc topic long lived asset and goodwill we review long lived asset including intangible asset subject to amortization for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable we ass the recoverability of the carrying value of asset held for use based on review of undiscounted projected cash flow impairment loss where identified are measured the excess of the carrying value of the long lived asset over it estimated fair value goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible asset acquired goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstance indicate that an impairment is more likely than not such circumstance include significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting unit or decision to dispose of reporting unit or significant portion of reporting unit the test for goodwill impairment is two step process that requires significant level of estimation and use of judgment by management particularly the estimate of the fair value of our reporting unit we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit based primarily on the discounted projected cash flow of the underlying operation this requires numerous assumption including the timing of work embedded in our backlog our performance and profitability under our contract our success in securing future business the appropriate risk adjusted interest rate used to discount the projected cash flow and terminal value growth and earnings rate applied to the final year of projected cash flow due to the variable inherent in our estimate of fair value difference in assumption may have material effect on the result of our impairment analysis to ass the reasonableness of our discounted projected cash flow we compare the sum of our reporting unit fair value to our market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium the excess of the sum of the reporting unit fair value over the market capitalization additionally we evaluate the reasonableness of each reporting unit fair value by comparing the fair value to comparable peer company and recent comparable market transaction we completed the required annual goodwill impairment test of december the first step of the goodwill impairment test compare the fair value of our reporting unit to their carrying value our reporting unit are consistent with our business group the estimated fair value for each of our reporting unit were in excess of their respective carrying value of december commitment and contingencieswe are subject to litigation and other legal proceeding arising either from the ordinary course of our business or under provision relating to the protection of the environment estimating liability and cost associated with these matter requires the use of judgment we record charge against earnings when liability associated with claim or pending or threatened litigation is probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable the ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matter may change further fact and circumstance become known deferred contract costscertain cost incurred in the performance of our government contract are recorded under gaap but are not allocable currently to contract such cost include portion of our estimated worker compensation obligation other insurance related assessment pension and other post retirement benefit and environmental expense these cost will become allocable to contract generally after they are paid we elected to defer or inventory these cost in contract in process until they can be allocated to contract we expect to recover these cost through ongoing business including existing backlog and probable follow on contract we regularly ass the probability of recovery of these cost this assessment requires that we make assumption about future contract cost the extent of cost recovery under our contract and the amount of future contract activity these estimate are based on our best judgment if the backlog in the future doe not support the continued deferral of these cost the profitability of our remaining contract could be adversely affected retirement plansour defined benefit pension and other post retirement benefit cost and obligation depend on several assumption and estimate the key assumption include interest rate used to discount estimated future liability and projected long term rate of return on plan asset we base the discount rate on current yield curve developed from portfolio of high quality fixed income investment with maturity consistent with the projected benefit payout period beginning in we refined the method used to determine the service and interest cost component of our net periodic benefit cost previously the cost wa determined using single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve described above under the refined method known the spot rate approach we use individual spot rate along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each service cost and discounted benefit obligation payment we believe this change provides more precise measurement of service and interest cost by improving the correlation between projected service cost and discounted benefit obligation cash outflow and corresponding spot rate on the yield curve compared to the previous method the spot rate approach decreased the service and interest component of our benefit cost slightly in we accounted for this change prospectively change in accounting estimate we determine the long term rate of return on asset based on consideration of historical and forward looking return and the current and expected asset allocation strategy following an assessment of the long term return of our various asset class we will alter the expected long term rate of return on asset in our primary government and commercial pension plan by basis point beginning in decreasing the weighted average expected long term rate of return to approximately percent this decrease is not expected to have material impact on our benefit cost in we adopted an updated mortality improvement scale published by the society of actuary that reflects slower average rate of improvement in mortality than in previous year additionally we updated other assumption to better align them with historical experience and anticipated future experience including rate of retirement and cost of living increase the impact of these change wa net decrease of and in the benefit obligation of our pension and other post retirement benefit plan respectively on december these retirement plan estimate are based on our best judgment including consideration of current and future market condition in the event any of the assumption change pension and other post retirement benefit cost could increase or decrease for further discussion including the impact of hypothetical change in the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan asset see note to the consolidated financial statement in item discussed under deferred contract cost our contractual arrangement with the government provide for the recovery of benefit cost for our government retirement plan we have elected to defer recognition of the benefit cost until such cost can be allocated to contract therefore the impact of annual change in financial reporting assumption on the retirement benefit cost for these plan doe not immediately affect our operating result standard updatessee note to the consolidated financial statement in item for information regarding accounting standard we adopted in and other new accounting standard that have been issued by the fasb but are not effective until after december item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskwe are exposed to market risk primarily from foreign currency exchange rate interest rate commodity price and investment see note to the consolidated financial statement in item for discussion of these risk the following quantifies the market risk exposure arising from hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate we had notional forward exchange contract outstanding of billion on december and billion on december percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of forward exchange contract would have resulted in the following hypothetical incremental pretax loss dollar in million unrecognized foreign currency our exchange rate sensitivity relates primarily to change in the canadian dollar euro and british pound exchange rate these loss would be offset by corresponding gain in the remeasurement of the underlying transaction being hedged we believe these foreign currency forward contract and the offsetting underlying commitment when taken together do not create material market risk interest rate risk our financial instrument subject to interest rate risk include fixed rate long term debt obligation and variable rate commercial paper on december we had billion par value of fixed rate debt and no commercial paper outstanding our fixed rate debt obligation are not putable and we do not trade these

we review long lived asset including intangible asset subject to amortization for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable we ass the recoverability of the carrying value of asset held for use based on review of undiscounted projected cash flow impairment loss where identified are measured the excess of the carrying value of the long lived asset over it estimated fair value determined by discounted projected cash flow we review goodwill for impairment annually or when circumstance indicate that an impairment is more likely than not goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible asset acquired the test for goodwill impairment is two step process to first identify potential goodwill impairment for each reporting unit and then if necessary measure the amount of the impairment loss our reporting unit are consistent with our business group in note we completed the required annual goodwill impairment test of december the first step of the goodwill impairment test compare the fair value of each of our reporting unit to it carrying value we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit based primarily on the discounted projected cash flow of the underlying operation the estimated fair value for each of our reporting unit wa in excess of it respective carrying value of december for summary of our goodwill by reporting unit see note accounting standard update we adopted the standard described below in asu fair value measurement topic disclosure for investment in certain entity that calculate net asset value per share or it equivalent asu remove from the fair value hierarchy all investment for which fair value is

on an employee behalf for tax withholding purpose is classified financing activity impact of the adoption in wa tax benefit of approximately this area of the asu permit only prospective adoption there wa no impact on our or consolidated financial statement in the consolidated statement of cash flow the impact of the adoption in wa increase in net cash provided by operating activity and corresponding increase in net cash used by financing activity the area of the asu that relate to the consolidated statement of cash flow were adopted retrospectively we have therefore restated our prior period consolidated statement of cash flow accordingly resulting in and increase in net cash provided by operating activity and corresponding and increase in net cash used by financing activity for the year ended december and respectively the other aspect of the asu did not have material impact on our result of operation financial condition or cash flow there are several other new accounting standard that have been issued by the fasb but are not effective until after december including the following asu income tax topic balance sheet classification of deferred tax asu requires that deferred tax asset and liability be classified noncurrent on the consolidated balance sheet we adopted the standard prospectively on the effective date january the adoption of asu resulted in reclassification among financial statement account but these reclassification did not change the total amount of our net deferred tax asset asu financial instrument overall subtopic recognition and measurement of financial asset and financial liability asu address certain aspect of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instrument specific to our business asu requires equity investment to be measured at fair value with change in fair value recognized in net income the asu eliminates the available for sale classification for equity investment that recognized change in the fair value component of other comprehensive income we intend to adopt the standard on the effective date with cumulative effect adjustment to the consolidated balance sheet of january we do not expect the adoption of asu to have material effect on our result of operation financial condition or cash flow asu lease topic asu requires the recognition of lease right and obligation asset and liability on the balance sheet previously lessee were not required to recognize on the balance sheet asset and liability arising from operating lease the asu also requires disclosure of key information about leasing arrangement asu is effective on january using the modified retrospective method of adoption with early adoption permitted we are in the preliminary phase of assessing the

of asset other than inventory asu requires recognition of the current and deferred income tax effect of an intra entity asset transfer other than inventory when the transfer occurs opposed to current gaap which requires company to defer the income tax effect of intra entity asset transfer until the asset ha been sold to an outside party the income tax effect of intra entity inventory transfer will continue to be deferred the inventory is sold asu is effective on january with early adoption permitted the standard is required to be adopted on modified retrospective basis with cumulative effect

presented on the consolidated statement of cash flow and the cash and equivalent balance presented on the consolidated balance sheet asu is effective retrospectively on january with early adoption

expect to record annual amortization expense over the next five year follows earnings per sharewe compute basic earnings per share eps using net earnings for the period and the weighted average number of common share outstanding during the period basic weighted average share outstanding have decreased throughout and due to share repurchase see note for additional detail of our share repurchase diluted eps incorporates the additional share issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock option and the release of restricted stock and restricted stock unit rsus the dilutive effect of stock option and restricted stock rsus increased because of the adoption of asu in see note for additional detail of our adoption of this accounting standard and diluted weighted average share outstanding were follows in thousand year ended december weighted average share effect of stock option and restricted stock rsus weighted average share excludes outstanding option to purchase share of common stock because these option had exercise price in excess of the average market price of our common stock during the year and therefore the effect of including these option would be antidilutive these option totaled in in and in fair value fair value is defined the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between marketplace participant various valuation approach can be used to determine fair value each requiring different valuation input the following hierarchy classifies the input used to determine fair value into three level level quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability level input other than quoted price observable by marketplace participant either directly or indirectly and level unobservable input significant to the fair value measurement we did not have any significant non financial asset or liability measured at fair value on december or our financial instrument include cash and equivalent and other investment account receivable and payable short and long term debt and derivative financial instrument the carrying value of cash and equivalent account receivable and payable and short term debt on the consolidated balance sheet approximate their fair value the following table present the fair value of our other financial asset and liability

determined under market approach using valuation model that incorporate observable input such interest rate bond yield and quoted price for similar asset and liability income taxesincome tax provision we calculate our provision for federal state and international income tax based on current tax law the reported tax provision differs from the amount currently receivable or payable because some income and expense item are recognized in different time period for financial reporting than for income tax purpose the following is summary of our net provision for income tax for continuing operation year ended december federal for income tax net income tax payment and local income tax allocable to government contract are included in operating cost and expense in the consolidated

income tax the effective tax rate in wa impacted favorably by increased international activity and the adoption of asu see note for further discussion of our adoption of this accounting standard the decrease in the effective tax rate in from wa due primarily to the favorable impact of contract close out largely resulting from interest from the completion of long term contract triggered by the prior settlement of litigation deferred tax asset the tax effect of temporary difference between reported earnings and taxable income consisted of the following december benefit loss and credit and

deferred tax asset of billion on december and billion on december related to the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss aocl to recognize the funded status of our retirement plan see note and for further discussion one of our deferred tax liability result from our participation in the capital construction fund ccf program established by the government and administered by the maritime administration that support the acquisition construction reconstruction or operation of flag merchant marine vessel the program allows to defer federal and state income tax on earnings derived from eligible program long the proceeds are deposited in the fund and withdrawal are used for qualified activity we had government account receivable pledged and thereby deposited to the ccf of on december and on december december we had net operating loss carryforwards of that begin to expire in capital loss carryforward of that expires in and tax credit carryforwards of that begin to

december we had approximately billion of undistributed earnings from these non subsidiary in general should these earnings be distributed portion would be treated dividend under tax law and thus subject to federal corporate income tax at the statutory rate of percent but would generate offsetting foreign tax credit tax uncertainty for all period open to examination by tax authority we periodically ass our liability and contingency based on the latest available information where we believe there is more than percent chance that our tax position will not be sustained we record our best estimate of the resulting tax liability including interest in the consolidated financial statement we include any interest or penalty incurred in connection with income tax part of income tax expense the total amount of these tax liability on december is not material to our result of operation financial condition or cash flow we participate in the internal revenue service irs compliance

tax matter for open year to have material impact on our result of operation financial condition cash flow or effective tax rate based on all known fact and circumstance and current tax law we believe the total amount of any unrecognized tax benefit on december is not material to our result of operation financial condition or cash flow and if recognized would not have material impact on our effective tax rate in addition there are no tax position for which it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefit will significantly vary over the next month producing individually or in the aggregate material effect on our result of operation financial condition or cash flow account receivableaccounts receivable represent amount billed and currently due from customer payment is

other contract cost represent amount that are not currently allocable to government contract such portion of our estimated worker compensation obligation other insurance related assessment pension and other post retirement benefit and environmental expense these cost will become allocable to contract generally after they are paid we expect to recover these cost through ongoing business including existing backlog and probable follow on contract if the backlog in the future doe not support the continued deferral of these cost the profitability of our remaining contract could be adversely affected the increase in contract in process is due primarily to the transition for large program in our combat system group from net liability position customer advance and deposit to net asset position contract in process we utilized significant customer deposit received upon contract award excluding our other contract cost we expect to bill all but approximately percent of our year end contract in process balance in the normal course of business during of the amount not expected to be billed in approximately relates to single contract in our information system and technology group

match the duration of the activity that are at risk record change in the fair value of derivative financial instrument in operating cost and expense in the consolidated statement of earnings or in

district court also in the suspending and debarring official for the department of the navy issued show cause letter to electric boat requesting that electric boat respond to the official concern regarding electric boat oversight and management with respect to it quality assurance system for subcontractor and supplier electric boat responded to the show cause letter and ha been engaged in discussion with the official given the current status of these matter we are unable to express view regarding the ultimate outcome or if the outcome is adverse to estimate an amount or range of reasonably possible loss depending on the outcome of these matter there could be material impact on our result of operation financial condition and cash flow additionally various claim and legal

subject to and affected by variety of federal state local and foreign environmental law and regulation we are directly or indirectly involved in environmental investigation or remediation at some of our current and former facility and third party site that we do not own but where we have been designated potentially responsible party prp by the environmental protection agency or state environmental agency based on historical experience we expect that significant percentage of the total remediation and compliance cost associated with these facility will continue to be allowable contract cost and therefore recoverable under government contract required we provide financial assurance for certain site undergoing or subject to investigation or remediation we accrue environmental cost when it is probable that liability ha been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated where applicable we seek insurance recovery for cost related to environmental liability we do not record insurance recovery before collection is considered probable based on all known fact and analysis we do not believe that our liability at any individual site or in the aggregate arising from such environmental condition will be material to our result of operation financial condition or cash flow we also do not believe that the range of reasonably possible additional loss beyond what ha been recorded would be material to our result of operation financial condition or cash flow minimum lease paymentstotal expense under operating lease wa in in and in operating lease are primarily for

due to customer directed change in the scope of work while we are entitled to recovery of these cost under our contract the administrative process with our customer may be protracted based upon the circumstance we periodically file request for equitable adjustment reas that are sometimes converted into claim in some case these request are disputed by our customer we believe our outstanding

associated with certain product sale we record estimated warranty cost in the period in which the related product are delivered the warranty liability recorded at each balance sheet date is generally

expected term and determined separate fair value for option granted for two employee population risk free interest rate is the yield on treasury zero coupon issue with remaining term equal to the expected term of the option at the grant date expected dividend yield is based on our historical dividend yield the resulting weighted average fair value per stock option granted wa in in and in stock

plan totaled in in and in the defined contribution plan held approximately million and million share of our common stock representing approximately percent and percent of our outstanding share on december and respectively pension benefit we have six noncontributory and five contributory trusteed qualified defined benefit pension plan covering eligible government business employee and two noncontributory and four contributory plan covering eligible commercial business employee including some employee of our international operation the primary factor affecting the benefit earned by participant in our pension plan are employee year of service and compensation level our primary government pension plan which comprises the majority of our unfunded obligation wa closed to new salaried participant on january additionally we made change to this plan for certain participant effective in that limit or cease the benefit that accrue for future service we made similar change to our primary commercial pension plan in we also sponsor one funded and several unfunded non qualified supplemental executive plan which provide participant with additional benefit including excess benefit over limit imposed on qualified plan by federal tax law other post retirement benefit we maintain plan that provide post retirement healthcare and life insurance coverage for certain employee and retiree these benefit vary by employment status age service and salary level at retirement the coverage provided and the extent to which the retiree share in the cost of the program vary throughout the company the plan provide health and life insurance benefit only to those employee retire directly from our service and not to those who terminate service prior to eligibility for retirement contribution and benefit paymentsit is our policy to fund our defined benefit retirement plan in manner that optimizes the tax deductibility and contract recovery of contribution considered within our capital deployment framework therefore we may make discretionary contribution in addition to the required contribution determined in accordance with irs regulation we contributed to our pension plan in and expect to contribute approximately in we maintain several tax advantaged account primarily voluntary employee beneficiary association veba trust to fund the obligation for some of our other post retirement benefit plan for non funded plan claim are paid received contribution to our other post retirement plan were not material in and are not expected to be material in expect the following benefit to be paid from our retirement plan over the next year pensionbenefits other post contract considerationsour contractual arrangement with the government provide for the recovery of contribution to our pension and other post retirement benefit plan covering employee working in our defense business group for non funded plan our government contract allow to recover claim paid following payment these recoverable amount are allocated to contract and billed to the customer in accordance with the cost accounting standard ca and specific contractual term for some of these plan the cumulative pension and other post retirement benefit cost exceeds the amount currently allocable to contract to the extent recovery of the cost is considered probable based on our backlog and probable follow on contract we defer the excess in contract in process on the consolidated balance sheet until the cost is allocable to contract see note for discussion of our deferred contract cost for other plan the amount allocated to contract and included in revenue ha exceeded the plan cumulative benefit cost we have deferred recognition of these excess earnings to provide better matching of revenue and expense these deferral have been classified against the plan asset on the consolidated balance sheet defined benefit retirement plan summary financial informationestimating retirement plan asset liability and cost requires the extensive use of actuarial assumption these include the long term rate of return on plan asset the interest rate used to discount projected benefit payment healthcare cost trend rate and future salary increase given the long term nature of the assumption being made actual outcome can and often do differ from these estimate our annual benefit cost consists of three primary element the cost of benefit earned by employee for service rendered during the year an interest charge on our plan liability and an assumed return on our plan asset for the year the annual cost also includes gain and loss resulting from change in actuarial assumption difference between the actual and assumed long term rate of return on asset and gain and loss resulting from change we make to plan benefit term we recognize an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheet equal to the funded status of each of our defined benefit retirement plan the funded status is the difference between the fair value of the plan asset and it benefit obligation change in plan asset and liability due to difference between actuarial assumption and the actual result of the plan are deferred in ocl rather than charged to earnings these difference are then amortized over future year component of our annual benefit cost we amortize actuarial difference under qualified plan on straight line basis over the average remaining service period of eligible employee we recognize the difference between the actual and expected return on plan asset for qualified plan over five year the deferral of these difference reduces the volatility of our annual benefit cost that can result either from year to year change in the assumption or from actual result that are not necessarily representative of the long term financial position of these plan we recognize difference under nonqualified plan immediately annual pension and other post retirement benefit cost consisted of the

december and respectively on december and some of our pension plan had an abo that exceeded the plan asset summary information for those plan follows abo fair value of plan plan assumptionswe calculate the plan asset and liability for given year and the net periodic benefit cost for the subsequent year using assumption determined of december of the year in question the following table summarizes the weighted average assumption used to determine our benefit obligation assumption on december benefit benefit obligation discount rate of increase in compensation other post retirement benefit benefit obligation discount healthcare cost trend rate trend rate for next ultimate trend year rate reach ultimate trend following table summarizes the weighted average assumption used to determine our net periodic benefit cost assumption for year ended december benefit discount rate benefit service interest expected long term rate of return on rate of increase in compensation other post retirement benefit discount rate benefit service interest expected long term rate of return on not applicable we changed to the spot rate approach beginning in further described below we base the discount rate on current yield curve developed from portfolio of high quality fixed income investment with maturity consistent with the projected benefit payout period beginning in we refined the method used to determine the service and interest cost component of our net periodic benefit cost previously the cost wa determined using single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve described above under the refined method known the spot rate approach we use individual spot rate along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each service cost and discounted benefit payment we believe this change provides more precise measurement of service and interest cost by improving the correlation between projected service cost and discounted benefit obligation cash outflow and corresponding spot rate on the yield curve compared to the previous method the spot rate approach decreased the service and interest component of our benefit cost slightly in we accounted for this change prospectively change in accounting estimate we determine the long term rate of return on asset based on consideration of historical and forward looking return and the current and expected asset allocation strategy following an assessment of the long term return of our various asset class we will alter the expected long term rate of return on asset in our primary government and commercial pension plan by basis point beginning in decreasing the weighted average expected long term rate of return to approximately percent this decrease is not expected to have material impact on our benefit cost in we adopted an updated mortality improvement scale published by the society of actuary that reflects slower average rate of improvement in mortality than in previous year additionally we updated other assumption to better align them with historical experience and anticipated future experience including rate of retirement and cost of living increase the impact of these change wa net decrease of and in the benefit obligation of our pension and other post retirement benefit plan respectively on december retirement plan assumption are based on our best judgment including consideration of current and future market condition change in these estimate impact future pension and other post retirement benefit cost discussed above we defer recognition of the cumulative benefit cost for our government plan in excess of cost allocable to contract to provide better matching of revenue and expense therefore the impact of annual change in financial reporting assumption on the cost for these plan doe not immediately affect our operating result for our pension plan that represent the majority of our total obligation the following hypothetical change in the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan asset would have had the following impact in basis point basis pointsincrease decrease to net pension cost from change in discount rate in long term rate of return on plan asset basis point change in these assumed rate would not have had measurable impact on the benefit cost for our other post retirement plan in for our healthcare plan the effect of percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate on the net periodic benefit cost is and respectively and the effect on the december accumulated other post retirement benefit obligation is and respectively plan assetsa committee of our board of director is responsible for the strategic oversight of our defined benefit retirement plan asset held in trust

fasb issued asu revenue from contract with customer topic in the standard outline five step model whereby revenue is recognized performance obligation within contract are satisfied the standard also requires new expanded disclosure regarding revenue recognition several asus have been issued since the issuance of asu these asus which modify certain section of asu are intended to promote more consistent interpretation and application of the principle outlined in the standard we adopted the new standard on january using the retrospective transition method asc topic impact the majority of our long term contract will continue to recognize revenue and earnings over time the work progress because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer generally using an input measure cost incurred to reflect progress the adoption of asc topic will have two primary impact on our portfolio of contract and our consolidated financial statement we will be precluded from using the reallocation method of recognizing adjustment in estimated profit on contract discussed in note the total impact of an adjustment in estimated profit recorded to date on contract will be recognized in the period it is identified cumulative catch up method rather than recognizing the impact of an adjustment prospectively over the remaining contract term result adjustment in contract estimate may be larger and likely more variable from period to period particularly on our contract of greater value and with longer performance period for example in our marine system group despite this variability contract cash flow and overall profitability at completion are the same under the cumulative catch up method and the reallocation method anticipated loss on contract will continue to be recognized in the quarter they are identified for our contract for the manufacture of business jet aircraft in the aerospace group we will record revenue under asc topic at single point in time when control is transferred to the customer generally when the customer accepts the fully outfitted aircraft asc topic will not change the total revenue or operating earnings recognized for each aircraft only the timing of when those amount are recognized prior to the adoption of asc topic we recorded revenue for these contract at two contractual milestone when green aircraft were completed and accepted by the customer and when the customer accepted final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft numerous other contract in our portfolio were impacted by asc topic due primarily to the identification of multiple performance obligation within single contract assessment we have assessed our and operating result under asc topic outlined in the table below the difference between the operating result reported in the consolidated financial statement and the business group information in note and the operating result in the table below is due only to the adoption of asc topic summary financial information for each of our business group follows revenue recognition accounting change of january restated revenuerestated operating earningsyear ended december system and total corporate operating result consist primarily of stock option expense diluted earnings per share from continuing operation reflecting the adoption of asc topic were in and in the primary driver of this difference is due to fewer outfitted aircraft delivery in than in the impact of asc topic on our and operating result may or may not be representative of the impact on subsequent year result noted above aircraft manufacturing revenue in our aerospace group will be recognized when control is transferred to the customer generally when the customer accepts the fully outfitted aircraft moreover in our defense group use of the cumulative catch up method of recognizing adjustment in estimated profit on our long term contract will require to recognize the total impact of an adjustment in the period it is identified rather than prospectively over the remaining contract term we have in the past on our consolidated balance sheet long term contract will continue to be reported in net contract asset contract in process or contract liability customer advance and deposit position on contract by contract basis at the end of each reporting period business jet component in our aerospace group will be reported in inventory until control of the aircraft transfer to the customer the assessment of our december consolidated balance sheet under asc topic will result in some reclassification among financial statement account but these reclassification will not materially change the total amount of net asset of december of independent registered public accounting firmthe board of director and
