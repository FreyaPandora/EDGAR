adversely affected by lower audience rating at our cable network broadcast network and owned local broadcast television station decline in audience rating also can be caused by increased competition for the leisure time of viewer and by audience fragmentation resulting from the increasing number of entertainment choice available including content from subscription video on demand service and other online source in addition advertising revenue is adversely affected by the growing use of technology such dvrs and video on demand service that give consumer greater flexibility to watch

fcc pole attachment rate standard which set rate for telecommunication service pole attachment to level at or near the rate for cable service attachment some municipality have enacted one touch make ready pole attachment ordinance which permit third party to alter component of our network attached to utility pole in way that could adversely affect our business one of these ordinance in state that ha preempted fcc jurisdiction ha been upheld by federal district court in challenge brought by another provider but another ordinance in state that not preempt fcc jurisdiction ha been vacated by federal district court in challenge brought by inconsistent with the fcc pole attachment rule in the fcc initiated rulemaking that considers amending it pole attachment rule to permit one touch like

fails to comply with material provision franchising authority also may establish reasonable requirement for public educational and governmental access programming and some of our franchise require substantial channel capacity and financial support for this programming the communication act also contains provision governing the franchising process including renewal procedure designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denial of renewal including unreasonable renewal condition we believe that our franchise renewal prospect are generally favorable but can not guarantee the future renewal of any individual franchise approximately half of the state in which we operate provide for statewide franchising or have simplified local franchising requirement for new entrant some allow new entrant to operate on more favorable term than our current operation for instance by not requiring that the new entrant provide service to all part of the franchise area or permitting the new entrant to designate only those portion it wish to serve certain state allow incumbent cable operator such to opt in to the new state franchise immediately or later competing state franchise ha been issued although even in those state incumbent cable operator may be required to retain certain franchise obligation that are more burdensome than the new entrant state franchise high speed

that wa upheld on appeal we are required to disclose our network management practice performance and commercial term of our internet service in addition to the commitment made part of the nbcuniversal

fcc deregulatory policy certain party have already indicated they intend to appeal the fcc order in federal court in addition congress may consider legislation addressing these regulation and the classification of broadband internet access service and legislator in numerous state have stated that they will introduce legislation to impose open internet protection in variety of way we can not predict whether or the rule might be changed the impact of potential new legislation or the outcome of any litigation broadband deployment infrastructure initiativesin the fcc initiated proceeding intended to remove barrier to deploying next generation wireless and wireline broadband infrastructure these proceeding may result in change to the fcc rule related to the deployment of broadband infrastructure well preemption of any state and local law or regulation that may unreasonably impede the deployment of broadband infrastructure we can not predict whether or how any fcc rule might be

local municipality operate municipally owned broadband network and there may be further effort by local government to expand or create government owned network certain state have enacted law that restrict or prohibit local municipality from operating municipally owned broadband network and there may be effort in other state legislature to restrict the development of government owned network although some may choose to ease or facilitate such network in addition part of any federal infrastructure program governmental subsidy or funding of additional internet broadband network may be encouraged we can not predict how successful those effort will be and how they might affect our business voice serviceswe provide voice service using voip technology the fcc ha adopted number of regulation for provider of nontraditional voice service such ours including regulation relating to privacy of customer proprietary network information local number portability duty and benefit disability access law enforcement assistance outage reporting universal service fund contribution obligation rural call completion back up power service discontinuance and certain regulatory filing

determination is important telecommunication service are regulated more extensively than information service state regulatory commission and legislature may continue to investigate imposing regulatory requirement on our voice service long the regulatory classification of voip remains unsettled at the federal level voice interconnectionbecause the fcc ha not determined the appropriate classification of our voice service provider of voip service typically either secure clec authorization or obtain interconnection to traditional wireline phone company network by contracting with an existing clec which ha the right telecommunication carrier to request and obtain interconnection with the traditional wireline phone company we have arranged for such interconnection right through affiliated clecs if regulatory or judicial annual report on form ktable of contentsauthority were to deny our ability to interconnect through one of our affiliated clecs our ability to provide voice service and

universal service program generally requires and other phone service provider to pay fee based on revenue from their interstate and international service into fund used to subsidize the provision of voice service and broadband capable voice network in high cost area the provision of voice service to low income consumer and the provision of internet voice and telecommunication service to school library and certain health care provider some state also have analogous program that support service in high cost area or to low income consumer the fcc ha long considered implementing change to the universal service program such changing the fee calculation from revenue based formula to per user fee or per connection fee adopting fee based on bandwidth and expanding the service subject to the fee to include broadband internet access service we are unable to predict if or how the fcc may change the universal service program or the effect any such change would have on our business the fcc recently ha shifted it focus away from supporting traditional telephone service and toward subsidizing deployment of broadband capable network and broadband facility this shift could assist some of our competitor for example the fcc ha revised the high cost federal universal service mechanism to support broadband capable network and substantially ha revised the program that provides universal service support for service to school and library to begin phasing support for voice service with greater support directed to broadband service and the deployment of wi fi network similarly the fcc ha expanded it lifeline subsidy program for low income consumer to include broadband service in addition to voice service the fcc or congress may revisit these subsidy program and how they are funded we can not predict whether or how these program will be changed in the future nbcuniversal segmentscable networksprogram accessthe communication act and fcc regulation generally prevent cable network affiliated with cable operator from favoring cable operator over competing mvpds the fcc and congress have considered proposal that would require company that own multiple cable network to make each

their content which could have an adverse effect on demand for our video service including for expanded video package premium network and our dvr and on demand service an increasing number of company offering subscription video on demand service including some that also offer exclusive high quality original video programming well programming network offering content directly to consumer over the internet have increased the number of entertainment choice available to consumer which ha intensified audience fragmentation the increase in entertainment choice adversely affect the audience rating of our cable network and broadcast television programming time shifting technology such video on demand service and dvr and cloud based recording service also reduce the viewing of content through traditional and virtual multichannel video provider which ha caused and likely will continue to cause audience rating decline for our cable network and broadcast television programming and may adversely affect the price and amount of advertising that advertiser are willing to purchase from and the amount nbcuniversal receives for distribution of it content the success of any of these ongoing or future development or our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitor or change in consumer behavior including among younger consumer could have an adverse effect on our competitive position business and result of operation decline in advertiser expenditure or change in advertising market could negatively impact our business our cable communication cable network and broadcast television business compete for the sale of advertising time with other television network and station well with all other advertising platform such digital medium radio and print we derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising and decline in expenditure by advertiser including through traditional linear television distribution model could negatively impact our result of operation decline can be caused by the economic prospect of specific advertiser or industry increased competition for the leisure time of viewer and audience fragmentation the growing use of new technology and online distribution platform or the economy in general in addition advertiser willingness to purchase advertising from may be adversely affected by lower audience rating which many of our network have experienced and likely will continue to experience advertising sale and rate also are dependent on the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodology do not accurately reflect actual viewership level for example certain method of viewing content such viewing content through many online distribution platform or delayed viewing on dvrs might not be counted in audience measurement or may generate le if any revenue than traditional linear television distribution method which could have an adverse effect on our advertising revenue our business depend on keeping pace with technological development our success is to large extent dependent on our ability to acquire develop adopt and leverage new and existing technology and our competitor use of certain type of technology and equipment may provide them with competitive advantage for example current and new wireless internet technology such and wireless broadband service continue to evolve rapidly to allow for greater speed and reliability and some company and municipality are building advanced fiber based network that provide very fast internet access speed we expect other advance in communication technology to occur in the future if we choose technology or equipment that is not effective or attractive to consumer that employed by our competitor if we fail to employ technology desired by consumer before our competitor do so or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiative our business and result of operation could be adversely affected we also will continue to incur additional cost we execute our technology initiative such the deployment of docsis and docsis fdx and the continued development of our set top box cloud dvr and wireless gateway there can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiative in manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or to compete successfully in the future we also may generate le revenue or incur increased cost if change in our competitor product offering require that we offer certain of our existing service or enhancement at lower or no cost to our customer or that we make additional research and development expenditure comcast annual report on form table of contentswe are subject to regulation by federal state local and foreign authority which impose additional cost and restriction on our business federal state and local government extensively regulate the video high speed internet and voice service industry our broadcast television business is also highly regulated by federal law and regulation our cable network filmed entertainment and theme park business are also subject to various other law and regulation at the international federal state and local level in addition we are subject to condition relating to the treatment of competitor and other matter set forth in the nbcuniversal consent decree which is currently scheduled to expire in september the fcc and certain state also have been active in conducting inquiry and review regarding our service and this trend may continue failure to comply with the law and regulation applicable to our business could result in administrative enforcement action fine and civil and criminal liability legislator and regulator at all level of government frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing statute rule regulation or interpretation thereof or prescribe new one which may significantly affect our business any future legislative judicial regulatory or administrative action may increase our cost or impose additional restriction on our business some of which may be significant congress may consider proposal to address communication issue including whether it should rewrite the entire communication act to account for change in the communication marketplace whether it should enact new permanent open internet requirement and whether it should fund new broadband infrastructure we are unable to predict the effect of any of these or any other further legislative requirement on our business any change to the legal and regulatory framework applicable to any of our service or business could have an adverse impact on our business and result of operation for more extensive discussion of the significant risk associated with the regulation of our business see item business and refer to the legislation and regulation discussion within that section programming expense for our video service are increasing which could adversely affect our cable communication segment video business we expect programming expense for our video service to continue to be our cable communication segment largest single expense item and to increase for the foreseeable future the multichannel video provider industry ha experienced continued increase in the cost of programming especially sport programming which we expect will continue for the foreseeable future our programming expense may also increase we add programming to our video service or distribute existing programming to more of our customer or through additional delivery platform such on demand or streaming service additionally in the past few year we have begun paying certain local broadcast television station in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to our video service customer we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demand for payment and other concession from local broadcast television station these market factor may be exacerbated by increased consolidation in the medium industry which may further increase our programming expense if we are unable to raise our customer rate or offset programming cost increase through the sale of additional service or cost management initiative the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our cable communication segment result of operation moreover our contract with content provider expire there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable term or that they will be renewed at all in which case we may be unable to provide such content part of our video service and our business and result of operation could be adversely affected nbcuniversal success depends on consumer acceptance of it content and it business may be adversely affected if it content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the cost to create or acquire content increase most of nbcuniversal business create and acquire medium and entertainment content the success of which depends substantially on consumer taste and preference that change in often unpredictable way the success of these business depends on our ability to consistently create acquire market and distribute cable network and broadcast television programming filmed entertainment theme park attraction and other content that meet the changing preference of the broad domestic and international consumer market we have invested and will continue to invest substantial amount in our content including in the production of original content on our cable network and broadcast television network in our film and for theme park attraction before learning the extent to which it would earn consumer acceptance we also obtain significant portion of our content from third party such movie studio television production company sport organization and other supplier competition for popular content particularly for sport programming is intense and we may have to increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitor for popular content entering into or renewing contract for such programming right or acquiring additional right may result in significantly increased cost particularly with respect to long term contract for sport programming right our result of operation and cash flow over the term of contract depend on number of factor including the strength of the advertising market our audience size the ability to secure distribution from and impose surcharge or obtain carriage on multichannel video provider for the content and the timing and amount of our right payment there can be no assurance that revenue from these contract will exceed our cost for the right well the annual report on form ktable of contentsother cost of producing and distributing the programming if our content doe not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or if we can not obtain or retain right to popular content on acceptable term or at all our business may be adversely affected the loss of nbcuniversal programming distribution agreement or the renewal of these agreement on le favorable term could adversely affect it business our cable network depend on their ability to secure and maintain distribution agreement with traditional and virtual multichannel video provider increasingly our cable network broadcast television and filmed entertainment business are also entering into agreement to license their prior season and library content on other distribution platform including subscription video on demand service if our programming doe not attract sufficient viewer traditional and virtual multichannel video provider may decide not to distribute our broadcast and cable network and subscription video on demand service may not license programming we create in addition the number of subscriber to our cable network may be reduced result of multichannel video provider offering smaller package of channel part of their virtual or traditional television programming package and by overall reduced viewing of television programming through multichannel video provider our broadcast television network depend on their ability to secure and maintain network affiliation agreement with third party local broadcast television station in the market where we do not own the affiliated local broadcast television station in addition every three year each of our owned local broadcast television station must elect with respect to it retransmission by multichannel video provider within it dma either must carry status in which the distributor carriage of the station is mandatory and doe not generate any compensation for the local station or retransmission consent in which the station give up it right to mandatory carriage and instead seek to negotiate the term and condition of carriage with the distributor including the amount of compensation if any paid to the station by such distributor for the current three year period which commenced on january all of our owned nbc broadcast television station and our owned telemundo broadcast television station elected retransmission consent however certain illegal online entity may stream our broadcast television content online without our consent and without paying any compensation to there can be no assurance that any of our distribution agreement will be renewed in the future on acceptable term or at all the loss of any of these agreement or the renewal of these agreement on le favorable term could reduce nbcuniversal revenue and the reach of our television programming and it attractiveness to advertiser which in turn could adversely affect our cable network broadcast television and filmed entertainment business we rely on network and information system and other technology well key

equipment data property and reputation these event also could result in large expenditure to repair or replace the damaged property product service network or information system to protect them from similar event in the future and any such event could lead to litigation or otherwise have an adverse effect on our result of operation in addition we may obtain certain confidential proprietary and personal information about our customer personnel and vendor and may provide this information to third party in connection with our business while we obtain assurance that these third party will

measure become more sophisticated despite our effort to prevent these event and security breach there can be no assurance that they will not occur in the future or will not have an adverse effect on our business moreover the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against loss resulting from any such event or security breach likely would not be sufficient to cover our loss or otherwise adequately compensate for any disruption to our business that may result and the occurrence of any such event or security breach could have an adverse effect on our business our business depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property right and on not infringing the intellectual property right of others we rely on our intellectual property such patent copyright trademark and trade

or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question from importing into the united state hardware that us such intellectual property or from the continuation of our business currently conducted we may need to change our business practice if any of these event occur which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our result of operation even if we believe any such challenge or claim are without merit they can be time consuming and costly to defend and divert management attention and resource away from our business moreover if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain license from our vendor and other third party on reasonable term our business could be adversely affected in addition intellectual property constitutes significant part of the value of nbcuniversal business and it success is highly dependent on protecting the intellectual property right of the content it creates or acquires against third party misappropriation reproduction or infringement the unauthorized reproduction distribution or display of copyrighted material negatively affect our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content well from the sale of advertising in connection with our content and increase our cost due to our active enforcement of our intellectual property right piracy and other unauthorized us of content are made easier and the enforcement of intellectual property right more challenging by technological advance that allow the conversion of programming film and other content into digital format which facilitates the creation transmission and sharing of high quality unauthorized copy in particular piracy of programming and film through unauthorized distribution on dvd peer to peer computer network and other platform continues to present challenge for our cable network broadcast television and filmed entertainment business while piracy is challenge in the united state it is particularly prevalent in many part of the world that lack developed copyright law effective enforcement of copyright law and technical protective measure like those in effect in the united state if any or international law intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property right are repealed or weakened or are not adequately enforced or if the legal system fails to adapt to new technology that facilitate piracy we may be unable to effectively protect our right the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our cost of enforcing our right may increase see item business and refer to the legislation and regulation other area of regulation intellectual property discussion for additional information we may be unable to obtain necessary hardware software and operational support we depend on third party vendor to supply with significant amount of the hardware software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our service some of these vendor represent our primary source of supply or grant the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software product while we actively monitor the operation and financial condition of key vendor in an attempt to detect any potential difficulty there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulty associated with these vendor or that we could effectively mitigate our risk with respect to any such difficulty if any of these vendor experience operating or financial difficulty if our demand exceeds their capacity or if they are otherwise unable to meet our specification or provide the equipment or service we need in timely manner or at reasonable price our ability to provide some service may be adversely affected weak economic condition may have negative impact on our business substantial portion of our revenue come from customer whose spending pattern may be affected by prevailing economic condition weak economic condition could adversely affect demand for any of our product and service and have negative impact on our result of operation for example customer may reduce the level of cable service to which they subscribe or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of our cable service this risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive service such subscription video on demand service or substitute service for our high speed internet and voice service such mobile phone smartphones and wi fi network weak economic condition also may have negative annual report on form ktable of contentsimpact on our advertising revenue the performance of our film and home entertainment release and attendance and spending in our theme park weak economic condition and turmoil in the global financial market may also impair the ability of third party to satisfy their obligation to and any disruption in the global financial market may affect our ability to obtain financing or refinance any existing debt on acceptable term acquisition and other strategic initiative present many risk and we may not realize the financial and strategic goal that we had contemplated from time to time we make acquisition and investment and may pursue other strategic initiative in connection with such acquisition and strategic initiative we may incur unanticipated expense fail to realize anticipated benefit have difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business disrupt relationship with current and new employee customer and vendor incur significant debt or have to delay or not proceed with announced transaction or initiative for example our launch of wireless phone service in using virtual network operator right ha success based working capital requirement primarily associated with the procurement of handset which customer are able to pay for upfront or finance interest free over month and other equipment which could have negative effect on our cash flow additionally regulatory agency such the fcc or doj may impose restriction on the operation of our business result of our seeking regulatory approval for any significant acquisition and strategic initiative or may dissuade from pursing certain transaction the occurrence of any of these event could have an adverse effect on our business labor dispute whether involving employee or sport organization may disrupt our operation and adversely affect our business many of nbcuniversal employee including writer director actor technical and production

and the resolution of any dispute may increase our cost there can be no assurance that we will renew our collective bargaining agreement they expire or that we can renew them on favorable term or without any work stoppage in addition our cable network and broadcast television network have programming right agreement of varying scope and duration with various sport organization to broadcast and produce sporting event including certain nfl nhl nba and mlb game labor dispute in these and other sport organization could have an adverse effect on our business the loss of key management personnel or popular on air and creative talent could have an adverse effect on our business we rely on certain key management personnel in the operation of our business while we maintain long term and emergency transition plan for key management personnel and believe we could either identify internal candidate or attract outside candidate to fill any vacancy created by the loss of any key management personnel the loss of one or more of our key management personnel could have negative impact on our business in addition our cable network broadcast television and filmed entertainment business depend on the ability and expertise of our on air and creative talent if we fail to retain our on air or creative talent if the cost to retain such talent increase materially if we need to make significant termination payment or if these individual lose their current appeal our business could be adversely affected we face risk relating to business internationally that could adversely affect our business we primarily through nbcuniversal operate our business worldwide there are risk inherent in doing business internationally including global financial market turmoil economic

revenue recognition critical accounting judgment and estimate the preparation of our consolidated financial statement requires to make estimate that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense and the related disclosure of contingent asset and contingent liability we base our judgment on our historical experience and on various other assumption that we believe are reasonable under the circumstance the result of which form the basis for making estimate about the carrying value of asset and liability that are not readily apparent from other source actual result may differ from these estimate under different assumption or condition we believe our judgment and related estimate associated with the valuation and impairment testing of our cable franchise right and the accounting for film and television cost are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statement management ha discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgment and estimate with the audit committee of our board of director and the audit committee ha reviewed our disclosure relating to them which are presented below see note and to comcast consolidated financial statement for discussion of our accounting policy with respect to these item valuation and impairment testing of cable franchise rightsour largest asset our cable franchise right result from agreement we have with state and local government that allow to construct and operate cable business within specified geographic area the value of franchise is derived from the economic benefit we receive from the right to solicit new customer and to market additional service such advanced video service and high speed internet and voice service in particular service area the amount we record for cable franchise right are primarily result of cable system acquisition typically when we acquire cable system the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise right often these cable system acquisition include multiple franchise area we currently serve approximately franchise area in the united state we have concluded that our cable franchise right have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factor which limit the period over which these right will contribute to our cash flow accordingly we do not amortize our cable franchise right but we ass their carrying value annually or more frequently whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may exceed the fair value impairment testing for the purpose of our impairment testing we have grouped the recorded value of our various cable franchise right into our three cable communication division or unit of account we evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level the annual impairment test for indefinite lived intangible asset allows for the option to first ass qualitative factor to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is le than it carrying amount an entity may choose to perform the qualitative assessment or an entity may bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test if it is determined on the basis of qualitative factor that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is more likely than not le than it carrying value the quantitative impairment test is required when performing quantitative assessment we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise right primarily based on discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant comcast annual report on form table of contentsjudgment when analyzing the fair value indicated under the discounted cash flow model we also consider multiple of adjusted ebitda generated by the underlying asset current market transaction and profitability information in we performed qualitative assessment of our cable franchise right at the time of our previous quantitative assessment in the estimated fair value of our franchise right exceeded the carrying value in our three cable communication division by and respectively we also considered various factor that would affect the estimated fair value of our cable franchise right in our qualitative assessment in including change in our projected future cash flow associated with our cable communication segment market transaction and macroeconomic condition weighted average cost of capital and an increase in our market capitalization based on this assessment we concluded that it wa more likely than not that the estimated fair value of our cable franchise right were higher than the carrying value and that the performance of quantitative impairment test wa not required since the adoption of the accounting guidance related to goodwill and intangible asset in we have not recorded any significant impairment charge to cable franchise right we could record impairment charge in the future if there are change in long term market condition in expected future operating result or in federal or state regulation that prevent from recovering the carrying value of these cable franchise right assumption made about increased competition and economic condition could also impact the result of any qualitative assessment and the valuation used in future annual quantitative impairment testing and result in reduction in the fair value of our cable franchise right in addition future change in the unit of account could result in the recognition of an impairment charge film and television costswe capitalize film and television production cost including direct cost production overhead print cost development cost and interest we amortize capitalized film and television production cost including acquired library and accrue cost associated with participation and residual payment to programming and production expense we generally record the amortization and the accrued cost using the individual film forecast computation method which amortizes the cost using the ratio of the current period revenue to estimated total remaining revenue from all source ultimate revenue estimate of ultimate revenue have significant impact on how quickly capitalized cost are amortized and therefore are updated regularly our estimate of ultimate revenue for film generally include revenue from all source that are expected to be earned within year from the date of film initial release these estimate are based on the historical performance of similar content well factor unique to the content itself the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue for film intended for theatrical release is the film theatrical performance subsequent revenue from the licensing and sale of film ha historically exhibited high correlation to it theatrical performance upon film release our estimate of revenue from succeeding market including from content licensing across multiple platform and home entertainment sale are revised based on historical relationship and an analysis of current market trend with respect to television series or other owned television programming the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue is whether the series can be successfully licensed beyond it initial license initial estimate of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue contracted for each episode under the initial license it is determined that television series or other owned television programming can be licensed for subsequent platform revenue estimate for these platform such and international syndication home entertainment and other distribution platform are included in ultimate revenue revenue estimate for produced episode include revenue expected to be earned within year of delivery of the initial episode or if still in production year from the delivery of the most recent episode if later we capitalize the cost of programming content that we license but do not own including right to multiyear live event sport programming at the earlier of when payment are made for the programming or when the license period begin and the content is made available for use we amortize capitalized programming cost the associated program are broadcast we generally amortize multiyear live event sport programming right using the ratio of the current period revenue to the estimated ultimate revenue or under the term of the contract capitalized film and television cost are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering event are identified if the fair value of production were to fall below it unamortized cost we would record an adjustment for the amount by which the unamortized capitalized cost exceed the production fair value the fair value assessment is generally based on estimated future discounted cash
