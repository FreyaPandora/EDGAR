accounting policy and estimatesthe preparation of the consolidated financial statement and note to consolidated financial statement presented in this annual report requires to make estimate that affect the reported amount of asset liability sale and expense and related disclosure of contingent asset and liability we base these estimate on historical result and various other assumption believed to be reasonable all of which form the basis for making estimate concerning the carrying value of asset and liability that are not readily available from other source actual result may differ from these estimate our significant accounting policy are described in note to the consolidated financial statement included herein we believe that the following accounting policy affect the most significant estimate and management judgment used in preparing the consolidated financial statement merchandise inventorydescriptionwe record an obsolete inventory reserve for the anticipated loss associated with selling inventory below cost this reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory level sale trend and historical experience during our reserve decreased approximately million to million of january we also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventory this reserve is based primarily on actual shrink result from previous physical inventory during the inventory shrink reserve increased approximately million to million of january in response to higher volume and estimated shrinkage rate based on result from previous physical inventory in addition we receive fund from vendor in the normal course of business principally result of purchase volume sale early payment or promotion of vendor product generally these vendor fund do not represent the reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable cost that we incurred to sell the vendor product many of the vendor fund associated with these purchase are earned under agreement that are negotiated on an annual basis or shorter the fund are recorded reduction to the cost of inventory they are earned the related inventory is sold the amount are recorded reduction to cost of sale fund that are determined to be reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable cost incurred to sell vendor product are recorded an offset to the related expense judgment and uncertainty involved in the estimatewe do not believe that our merchandise inventory are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practice based on anticipated sale trend and general economic condition however change in consumer purchasing pattern or deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserve likewise change in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary based on the timing and result of physical inventory we also apply judgment in the determination of level of obsolete inventory and assumption about net realizable value for vendor fund we develop accrual rate based on the provision of the agreement in place due to the diversity of the individual vendor agreement we perform analysis and review historical purchase trend and volume throughout the year adjust accrual rate appropriate and confirm actual amount with select vendor to ensure the amount earned are of contentsappropriately recorded amount accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volume differ from projected purchase volume especially in the case of program that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volume are met effect if actual result differ from assumptionswe have not made any material change in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserve for obsolete inventory or inventory shrinkage during the past three fiscal year we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimate for both of these inventory reserve however it is possible that actual result could differ from recorded reserve change in either the amount of product considered obsolete or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our obsolete inventory reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately million for change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrink reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately million for we have not made any material change in the methodology used to recognize vendor fund during the past three fiscal year if actual result are not consistent with the assumption and estimate used we could be exposed to additional adjustment that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory however substantially all receivables associated with these activity do not require subjective long term estimate because they are collected within the following fiscal year adjustment to gross margin and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material long lived asset impairmentdescriptionwe review the carrying amount of location whenever certain event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable when evaluating location for impairment our asset group is at an individual location level that is the lowest level for which cash flow are identifiable cash flow for individual location do not include an allocation of corporate overhead we evaluate location for triggering event relating to long lived asset impairment on quarterly basis to determine when location asset may not be recoverable for operating location our primary indicator that asset may not be recoverable is consistently negative cash flow for twelve month period for those location that have been open in the same location for sufficient period of time to allow for meaningful analysis of ongoing operating result management also monitor other factor when evaluating operating location for impairment including individual location execution of their operating plan and local market condition including incursion which is the opening of either other lowe location or those of direct competitor within the same market we also consider there to be triggering event when there is current expectation that it is more likely than not that given location will be closed or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of it previously estimated useful life potential impairment ha occurred if projected future undiscounted cash flow expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the location asset are le than the carrying amount of the asset the carrying value of location asset group includes inventory property operating and finance lease right of use asset and operating liability including inventory payable salary payable and operating lease liability financial and nonoperating liability are excluded from the carrying value of the asset group when determining the stream of projected future cash flow associated with an individual operating location management make assumption incorporating local market condition about key store variable including sale growth rate gross margin and controllable expense such store payroll and operating expense well asset residual value or lease rate operating lease payment are included in the projected future cash flow financing lease payment are excluded from the projected future cash flow an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the operating location is not recoverable and exceeds it fair value we use an income approach to determine the fair value of our individual operating location which requires discounting projected future cash flow this involves making assumption regarding both location future cash flow described above and an appropriate discount rate to determine the present value of those future cash flow we discount our cash flow estimate at rate commensurate with the risk that selected market participant would assign to the cash flow the selected market participant represent group of other retailer with market footprint similar in size to ours we use market approach to determine the fair value of our individual location identified for closure this involves making assumption regarding the estimated selling price or estimated lease rate by obtaining information from property broker or appraiser in the specific market being evaluated the information includes comparable sale of similar asset and assumption about demand in the market for purchase or lease of these asset of contentsjudgments and uncertainty involved in the estimateour impairment evaluation require to apply judgment in determining whether triggering event ha occurred including the evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that location will be closed significantly before the end of it previously estimated useful life our impairment loss calculation require to apply judgment in estimating expected future cash flow including estimated sale margin and controllable expense assumption about market performance for operating location and estimated selling price or lease rate for location identified for closure we also apply judgment in estimating asset fair value including the selection of an appropriate discount rate for fair value determined using an income approach effect if actual result differ from assumptionsduring fiscal year and long lived asset impairment recorded within selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of earnings wa immaterial we have not made any material change in the methodology used to estimate the future cash flow of operating location or location identified for closure during the past three fiscal year if the actual result are not consistent with the assumption and judgment we have made in determining whether it is more likely than not that location will be closed significantly before the end of it useful life or in estimating future cash flow and determining asset fair value our actual impairment loss could vary from our estimated impairment loss in the event that our estimate vary from actual result we may record additional impairment loss which could be material to our result of operation self insurancedescriptionwe are self insured for certain loss relating to worker compensation automobile general and product liability extended protection plan and certain medical and dental claim we have excess insurance coverage above certain retention amount to limit exposure from single event and earnings volatility our self insured retention or deductible applicable is limited to million per occurrence involving worker compensation million per occurrence involving general or product liability and million per occurrence involving automobile we do not have any excess insurance coverage for self insured extended protection plan or medical and dental claim self insurance claim filed and claim incurred but not reported are accrued based upon our estimate of the discounted ultimate cost for self insured claim incurred using actuarial assumption followed in the insurance industry and historical experience during our self insurance liability increased approximately million to billion of january judgment and uncertainty involved in the estimatethese estimate are subject to change in the regulatory environment utilized discount rate projected exposure including payroll sale and vehicle unit well the frequency lag and severity of claim effect if actual result differ from assumptionswe have not made any material change in the methodology used to establish our self insurance liability during the past three fiscal year although we believe that we have the ability to reasonably estimate loss related to claim it is possible that actual result could differ from recorded self insurance liability change in our self insurance liability would have affected net earnings by approximately million for basis point change in our discount rate would have affected net earnings by approximately million for item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskin addition to the risk inherent in our operation we are exposed to certain market risk including change in interest rate commodity price and foreign currency exchange rate interest rate riskwe use forward starting interest rate swap to hedge our exposure to the impact of interest rate change in future debt issuance the fair value of our derivative financial instrument of january wa not material fluctuation in interest rate do not have material impact on our financial condition and result of operation because our long term debt is carried at amortized cost and consists primarily of fixed rate instrument therefore providing quantitative information about interest rate risk is not meaningful for our financial instrument of contentscommodity price riskwe purchase certain commodity product that are subject to price volatility caused by factor beyond our control which could potentially have material impact on our financial condition and or result of operation we believe that the price volatility of these product is partially mitigated by our ability to adjust selling price the selling price of these
