receiving government research and development assistance marketing subsidy and other assistance for certain of their commercial product beyond the assistance that may be available in the customer selection of aircraft engine component and system can also have significant impact on future sale of part and service in addition the government and other government policy of purchasing part from supplier other than the original equipment manufacturer affect military spare part sale significant element of our aerospace business such spare part sale for engine and aircraft in service have short

should overall government defense spending decline it could result in significant reduction to revenue cash flow profit and backlog for our military business one or more of the program that we currently support or are currently pursuing could be phased out limited or terminated reduction in these existing program unless offset by other program and opportunity could have material adverse effect on our competitive position cash flow result of operation or financial condition our international operation subject to economic risk our result of operation may be adversely affected by change in foreign currency fluctuation economic condition and change in local government regulation we conduct our business on global basis with approximately percent of our total segment sale derived from international operation including export sale change in local and regional economic condition including fluctuation in exchange rate may affect product demand and reported profit in our non operation especially the commercial business and wc transaction are generally denominated in local currency in addition currency fluctuation may affect the price we pay supplier for material used in our product result our operating margin also may be negatively impacted by worldwide currency fluctuation that result in higher cost for certain cross border transaction our financial statement are denominated in dollar accordingly fluctuation in exchange rate may also give rise to translation gain or loss when financial statement of non operating unit are translated into dollar given that the majority of our sale are non based strengthening of the dollar other major foreign currency could adversely affect our result of operation the majority of sale in the aerospace business are transacted in dollar consistent with established industry practice while the majority of cost at location outside the are incurred in the applicable local currency principally the euro the canadian dollar and the polish zloty for operating unit with dollar sale and local currency cost there is foreign currency exposure that could impact our result of operation depending on market change in the exchange rate of the dollar against the applicable foreign currency to manage certain exposure we employ long term hedging strategy associated with dollar sale see note and to the consolidated financial statement in our annual report for further discussion of our hedging strategy of contentsour international sale and operation are subject to risk associated with change in local government law regulation and policy including those related to tariff and trade barrier investment taxation exchange control capital control employment regulation and repatriation of earnings government policy on international trade and investment such import quota capital control punitive tax or tariff whether adopted by individual government or addressed by regional trade bloc can affect demand for our product and service impact the competitive position of our product or prevent from being able to manufacture or sell product in certain country the implementation of more restrictive trade policy or the renegotiation of existing trade agreement in the or country where we sell large quantity of product and service or procure supply and other material incorporated into our product could negatively impact our business result of operation and financial condition for example government adoption of buy national policy or retaliation by another government against such policy such tariff could have negative impact on our result of operation our international sale and operation are also sensitive to change in foreign national priority including government budget well to political and economic instability international transaction may involve increased financial and legal risk due to differing legal system and custom in foreign country for example condition of sale or award of contract some international customer require to agree to offset arrangement which may include in country purchase manufacturing and financial support arrangement the contract may provide for penalty in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirement in addition part of our globalization strategy we have invested in certain country including argentina brazil china india indonesia mexico poland russia south africa ukraine and country in the middle east that carry high level of currency political compliance and economic risk we expect that sale to emerging market will continue to account for significant portion of our sale our business evolve and these and other developing nation and region around the world increase their demand for our product emerging market operation can present many risk including cultural difference such employment and business practice volatility in gross domestic product economic and government instability and the imposition of exchange control and capital control while these factor and their impact are difficult to predict any one or more of could have material adverse effect on our competitive position result of operation cash flow or financial condition we use variety of raw material supplier provided part component sub system and contract manufacturing service in our business and significant shortage supplier capacity constraint supplier production disruption or price increase could increase our operating cost and adversely impact the competitive position of our product our reliance on supplier including third party contract manufacturing and logistics and commodity market to secure raw material part component and sub system used in our product expose to volatility in the price and availability of these material in many instance we depend upon single source of supply manufacturing logistics support or assembly or participate in commodity market that may be subject to allocation of limited supply by supplier disruption in delivery from our supplier supplier capacity constraint supplier production disruption supplier quality issue closing or bankruptcy of our supplier price increase or decreased availability of raw material or commodity could have material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitment to customer or increase our operating cost we believe that our supply management and production practice are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risk and the cost of alternative practice nonetheless price increase supplier capacity constraint supplier production disruption or the unavailability of some raw material may have material adverse effect on our competitive position result of operation cash flow or financial condition we engage in acquisition and divestiture and may encounter difficulty integrating acquired business with or disposing of divested business from our current operation therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefit of these acquisition and divestiture we seek to grow through strategic acquisition in addition to internal growth in the past several year we have made various acquisition and have entered into joint venture arrangement intended to complement and expand our business including the pending acquisition of rockwell collins and expect to continue to do in the future our due diligence review may not identify all of the material issue necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingency of particular transaction including potential exposure to regulatory sanction resulting from an acquisition target previous activity for example we may incur unanticipated cost expense or other liability result of an acquisition target violation of applicable law such the foreign corrupt practice act fcpa or other anti bribery and corruption law in non jurisdiction we may incur unanticipated cost or expense including post closing asset impairment charge expense associated with eliminating duplicate facility litigation and other liability we also may encounter difficulty in integrating acquired business with our operation applying our internal control process to these acquired business or in managing strategic investment additionally we may not realize the degree or timing of benefit we anticipate when we first enter into transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and result of operation in addition of contentsaccounting requirement relating to business combination including the requirement to expense certain acquisition cost incurred may cause to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during period in which we acquire new business furthermore we make strategic divestiture from time to time our divestiture may result in continued financial exposure to the divested business such through guarantee or other financial arrangement or continued supply and service arrangement following the transaction under these arrangement nonperformance by those divested business could result in obligation being imposed on that could have material adverse effect on our competitive position cash flow result of operation or financial condition the success of future acquisition including the rockwell collins transaction and divestiture will depend on the satisfaction of condition precedent to and consummation of the pending transaction the timing of consummation of these pending transaction and the ability of the party to secure any required regulatory approval in timely manner among other thing we also enter into joint venture in which we maintain significant influence but do not control the business accordingly our ability to apply our internal control and compliance policy to these business is limited and can result in additional financial and reputational risk we may not complete the acquisition of rockwell collins or complete the acquisition within the time frame we anticipate the acquired business may underperform relative to our expectation the acquisition may cause our financial result to differ from our expectation or the expectation of the investment community we may not be able to achieve anticipated cost saving or other anticipated synergy the completion of the acquisition of rockwell collins is subject to number of condition including the receipt of required regulatory approval the failure to satisfy all of the required condition could delay the completion of the acquisition for significant period of time or prevent it from occurring at all any delay in completing the acquisition could cause utc not to realize some or all of the benefit or realize them on different timeline than expected that utc expects to achieve if the acquisition is successfully completed within the expected time frame in addition the term and condition of the required regulatory authorization and consent for the acquisition that are granted if any may impose requirement limitation or cost or place restriction on the conduct of the combined company business or may materially delay the completion of the acquisition the ultimate success of the acquisition will depend in part on utc ability to successfully combine and integrate the business of utc and rockwell collins and realize the anticipated benefit including synergy cost saving innovation opportunity and operational efficiency from the acquisition if utc is unable to achieve these objective within the anticipated time frame or at all the anticipated benefit may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected and the value of utc common stock may decline the integration of the two company may result in material challenge including without limitation the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concern and performance shortfall at one or both of the company result of the devotion of management attention to the acquisition managing larger combined aerospace system business maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employee retaining existing business and operational relationship including customer supplier and employee and other counterparties may be impacted by contract containing consent and or other provision that may be triggered by the acquisition and attracting new business and operational relationship the possibility of faulty assumption underlying expectation regarding the integration process consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructure and eliminating duplicative operation coordinating geographically separate organization unanticipated issue in integrating information technology communication and other system and unforeseen expense or delay associated with the acquisition our debt level and related debt service obligation could have negative consequence our ability to access debt may be affected by change in global capital market our financial performance or outlook or our credit rating we have outstanding debt and other financial obligation and significant unused borrowing capacity in connection with the rockwell collins merger we anticipate that approximately billion will be required to pay the aggregate cash portion of the merger consideration we expect to fund the cash portion of the merger consideration through debt issuance and cash on hand we expect to assume approximately billion of rockwell collins outstanding debt upon completion of the merger the increased indebtedness of utc in connection with the merger may have the effect of among other thing downgrade of our credit rating resulting in increased borrowing cost of content requiring to dedicate significant cash flow from operation to the payment of principal and interest on our debt which would reduce fund we have available for other purpose such acquisition reinvestment in our business dividend and repurchase of our common stock reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to change in our business and market condition and exposing to interest rate risk at the time of refinancing outstanding debt or on the portion of our debt obligation that are issued at variable rate we depend in part upon the issuance of debt to fund our operation and contractual commitment if we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing commitment or meet other business requirement our market liquidity may not be sufficient number of factor could cause to incur increased borrowing cost and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private market for debt including disruption or decline in the global capital market and or decline in our financial performance outlook or credit rating in particular following the announcement of the proposed rockwell collins acquisition the credit rating agency announced that they were reviewing our credit rating for possible downgrade quarterly cash dividend and share repurchase may be discontinued or modified are subject to number of uncertainty and may affect the price of our common stock quarterly cash dividend and share repurchase under our share repurchase program constitute component of our capital allocation strategy which we fund with free operating cash flow borrowing and divestiture however we are not required to declare dividend or make any share repurchase under our share repurchase program dividend and share repurchase may be discontinued accelerated suspended or delayed at any time without prior notice even if not discontinued the amount of such dividend and repurchase may be changed and the amount timing and frequency of such dividend and repurchase may vary from historical practice or from the company stated expectation decision with respect to dividend and share repurchase are subject to the discretion of our board of director and will be based on variety of factor important factor that could cause to discontinue limit suspend increase or delay our quarterly cash dividend or share repurchase include market condition the price of our common stock the nature and timing of other investment opportunity change in our business strategy the term of our financing arrangement our outlook to the ability to obtain financing at attractive rate the impact on our credit rating and the availability of domestic cash to help manage the cash flow and liquidity impact resulting from the pending rockwell collins acquisition we have among other thing suspended share repurchase excluding activity relating to our employee saving plan we continue to ass the impact of the tcja future opportunity for repatriation of our non earnings and accelerated de leveraging we may consider in addition to investment in our operation limited additional share repurchase to offset the effect of dilution related to our stock based compensation program see note to the consolidated financial statement in our annual report the reduction or elimination of our cash dividend or share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock additionally there can be no assurance that any share repurchase will enhance shareholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the level at which we repurchased share of common stock although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance long term shareholder value short term stock price fluctuation could reduce the program effectiveness see item market for registrant common equity related stockholder matter and issuer purchase of equity security in this form for description of our share repurchase program and past share repurchase including our prior accelerated share repurchase asr transaction we design manufacture and service product that incorporate advanced technology the introduction of new product and technology involves risk and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefit initially anticipated we seek to achieve growth through the design development production sale and support of innovative product that incorporate advanced technology the product program and service need of our customer change and evolve regularly and we invest substantial amount in research and development effort to pursue advancement in wide range of technology product and service of particular note pratt whitney is currently producing and delivering the purepower geared turbofan engine to power various aircraft including the family of aircraft which entered into service in january the level of order received for the purepower family of engine coupled with requirement to achieve mature production level in short time frame are necessitating significant additional manufacturing and supply chain capacity if any of our production ramp effort are delayed if supplier can not timely deliver or perform to our standard and or if we identify or experience issue with in service engine we may not meet customer production schedule which could result in material additional cost including penalty that could be assessed under existing contractual provision our ability to realize the anticipated benefit of our technological advancement depends on variety of factor including meeting development production certification and regulatory approval schedule execution of internal and external performance plan availability of contentsof supplier and internally produced part and material performance of supplier and subcontractor availability of supplier and internal facility capacity to perform maintenance repair and overhaul service on our product hiring and training of qualified personnel achieving cost and production efficiency identification of emerging technological trend in our target end market validation of innovative technology the level of customer interest in new technology and product and customer acceptance of our product and product that incorporate technology we develop for example certain of our aerospace product are incorporated into larger system and end product manufactured by our customer these system and end product may incorporate additional technology manufactured by third party and involve additional risk and uncertainty result the performance and market acceptance of these larger system and end product could affect the level of customer interest and acceptance of our own product in the marketplace any development effort divert resource from other potential investment in our business and these effort may not lead to the development of new technology or product on timely basis or meet the need of our customer fully competitive offering in addition the market for our product or product that incorporate our technology may not develop or grow we anticipate we or our customer supplier or subcontractor may encounter difficulty in developing and producing new product and service and may not realize the degree or timing of benefit initially anticipated or may otherwise suffer significant adverse financial consequence due to the design complexity of our product in the future we may experience delay in completing the development and introduction of new product any delay could result in increased development cost or deflect resource from other project in particular we can not predict with certainty whether when and in quantity our aerospace business will produce and sell aircraft engine aircraft system and component and other product currently in development or pending required certification our contract are typically awarded on competitive basis our bid are based upon among other item the cost to provide the product and service to generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contract we must be able to accurately estimate our cost to provide the service and

not be sure that our competitor will not develop competing technology which gain market acceptance in advance of or instead of our product the possibility also exists that our competitor might develop new technology or offering that might cause our existing technology and offering to become obsolete in addition the possibility exists that competitor will develop aftermarket service and aftermarket
