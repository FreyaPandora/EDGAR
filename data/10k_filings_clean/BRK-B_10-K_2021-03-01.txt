risk and uncertainty described below are not the only risk we face additional risk and uncertainty that are presently unknown or are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business operation general business risk terrorist act could hurt our operating business cyber biological nuclear or chemical attack could produce significant loss to our worldwide operation our business operation could be adversely affected from such act through the loss of human resource or destruction of production facility and information system we share the risk with all business cyber security risk we rely on technology in virtually all aspect of our business like those of many large business certain of our information system have been subject to computer virus malicious code unauthorized access phishing effort denial of service attack and other cyber attack and we expect to be subject to similar attack in the future such attack become more sophisticated and frequent significant disruption or failure of our technology system could result in service interruption safety failure security event regulatory compliance failure an inability to protect information and asset against unauthorized user and other operational difficulty attack perpetrated against our system could result in loss of asset and critical information and expose to remediation cost and reputational damage although we have taken step intended to mitigate these risk including business continuity planning disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis significant disruption or cyber intrusion could adversely affect our result of operation financial condition and liquidity additionally if we are unable to acquire develop implement adopt or protect right around new technology we may suffer competitive disadvantage which could also have an adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and or liquidity cyber attack could further adversely affect our ability to operate facility information technology and business system or compromise confidential customer and employee information political economic social or financial market instability or damage to or interference with our operating asset customer or supplier from cyber attack may result in business interruption lost revenue higher commodity price disruption in fuel supply lower energy consumption unstable market increased security repair or other cost or may materially adversely affect in way that can not be predicted at this time any of these risk could materially affect our consolidated financial result furthermore instability in the financial market resulting from terrorism sustained or significant cyber attack or war could also have material adverse effect on our ability to raise capital we share these risk with all business we are dependent on few key people for our major investment and capital allocation decision major investment decision and all major capital allocation decision are made by warren buffett chairman of the board of director and chief executive officer age in consultation with charles munger vice chairman of the board of director age if for any reason the service of our key personnel particularly mr buffett were to become unavailable there could be material adverse effect on our operation however berkshire board of director ha identified certain current berkshire manager who in their judgment are capable of succeeding mr buffett and ha agreed on replacement for mr buffett replacement be needed currently the board continually monitor this risk and could alter it current view regarding replacement for mr buffett in the future we believe that the board succession plan together with the outstanding manager running our numerous and highly diversified operating unit help to mitigate this risk in berkshire board of director appointed mr gregory abel vice chairman of berkshire non insurance operation and mr ajit jain vice chairman of berkshire insurance operation mr abel and mr jain each report directly to mr buffett and mr buffett continues to be responsible for major capital allocation and investment decision we need qualified personnel to manage and operate our various business in our decentralized business model we need qualified and competent management to direct day to day business activity of our operating subsidiary and to manage change in future business operation due to changing business or regulatory environment our operating subsidiary also need qualified and competent personnel in executing their business plan and serving their customer supplier and other stakeholder our inability to recruit and retain qualified and competent manager and personnel could negatively affect the operating result financial condition and liquidity of our subsidiary and berkshire whole investment are unusually concentrated in equity security and fair value are subject to loss in value we concentrate high percentage of the equity security investment of our insurance subsidiary in relatively small number of equity security significant decline in the fair value of our larger investment in equity security may produce material decline in our consolidated shareholder equity and our consolidated earnings since large percentage of our equity security are held by our insurance subsidiary significant decrease in the fair value of these investment will produce significant decline in the statutory surplus of our insurance business our large statutory surplus is competitive advantage and long term material decline could have an adverse effect on our claim paying ability rating and our ability to write new insurance business thus potentially reducing our future underwriting profit over ten year ago we assumed the risk of potentially significant loss under number of equity index put option contract which contain equity price risk most of the contract remaining at year end will expire by february risk of loss under these contract are based on decline in equity price of stock comprising certain major and international stock index we received considerable cash premium compensation for accepting these risk absent major reduction in future equity security price our ultimate payment obligation are not likely to be significant nevertheless there can be no assurance that equity security price will not decline significantly resulting in significant settlement payment upon contract expiration competition and technology may erode our business franchise and result in lower earnings each of our operating business face intense competition within market in which they operate while we manage our business with the objective of achieving long term sustainable growth by developing and strengthening competitive advantage many factor including technological change may erode or prevent the strengthening of competitive advantage accordingly our future operating result will depend to some degree on our operating unit successfully protecting and enhancing their competitive advantage if our operating business are unsuccessful in these effort our periodic operating result in the future may decline unfavorable general economic condition may significantly reduce our operating earnings and impair our ability to access capital market at reasonable cost our operating business are subject to normal economic cycle affecting the general economy or the specific industry in which they operate significant deterioration of economic condition over prolonged period could produce material adverse effect on one or more of our significant operation in addition our utility and energy business and our railroad business regularly utilize debt component of their capital structure and depend on having access to borrowed fund through the capital market at reasonable rate to the extent that access to the capital market is restricted or the cost of funding increase these operation could be adversely affected epidemic pandemic or other outbreak including covid could hurt our operating business the outbreak of covid ha adversely affected and in the future it or other epidemic pandemic or outbreak may adversely affect our operation including our equity security portfolio this is or may be due to closure or restriction requested or mandated by governmental authority disruption to supply chain and workforce reduction of demand for our product and service credit loss when customer and other counterparties fail to satisfy their obligation to and volatility in global equity security market among other factor we share most of these risk with all business regulatory change may adversely impact our future operating result over time in response to financial market crisis global economic recession and social and environmental issue regulatory initiative were adopted in the united state and elsewhere such initiative addressed for example the regulation of bank and other major financial institution product and environmental and global warming matter these initiative impact all of our business albeit in varying way increased regulatory compliance cost could have significant negative impact on our operating business well on the business in which we have significant but not controlling economic interest we can not predict whether such initiative will have material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position result of operation and or cash flow data privacy regulation have recently been enacted in various jurisdiction in the and throughout the world these regulation address numerous aspect related to the security of personal information that is stored in our information system network and facility failure to comply with these regulation could result in reputational damage and significant penalty risk unique to our regulated business our tolerance for risk in our insurance business may result in significant underwriting loss when properly paid for the risk assumed we have been and will continue to be willing to assume more risk from single event than any other insurer ha knowingly assumed accordingly we could incur significant loss from single catastrophe event resulting from natural disaster or man made catastrophe such terrorism or cyber attack we employ various disciplined underwriting practice intended to mitigate potential loss and attempt to take into account all possible correlation and avoid writing group of policy from which pre tax loss from single catastrophe event might aggregate above billion currently we estimate that our aggregate exposure from single event under outstanding policy is significantly below billion however despite our effort it is possible that loss could manifest in way that we do not anticipate and that our risk mitigation strategy are not designed to address additionally various provision of our policy such limitation or exclusion from coverage negotiated to limit our risk may not be enforceable in the manner we intend our tolerance for significant insurance loss may result in lower reported earnings in future period the degree of estimation error inherent in the process of estimating property and casualty insurance loss reserve may result in significant underwriting loss the principal cost associated with the property and casualty insurance business is claim in writing property and casualty insurance policy we receive premium today and promise to pay covered loss in the future however it will take decade before all claim that have occurred of any given balance sheet date will be reported and settled although we believe that liability for unpaid loss are adequate we will not know whether these liability or the premium charged for the coverage provided were sufficient until well after the balance sheet date estimating insurance claim cost is inherently imprecise our estimated unpaid loss arising under contract covering property and casualty insurance risk are large billion at december and small percentage increase to those liability can result in materially lower reported earnings change in regulation and regulatory action can adversely affect our operating result and our ability to allocate capital our insurance business are subject to regulation in the jurisdiction in which we operate such regulation may relate to among other thing the type of business that can be written the rate that can be charged for coverage the level of capital that must be maintained and restriction on the type and size of investment that can be made regulation may also restrict the timing and amount of dividend payment to berkshire by these business state insurance regulator and international insurance regulator are also actively developing various regulatory mechanism to address the regulation of large internationally active insurance group including regulation concerning group capital liquidity governance and risk management accordingly change

capital our railroad business conducted through bnsf is also subject to significant number of law and regulation with respect to rate and practice tax railroad operation and variety of health safety labor environmental and other matter failure to comply with applicable law and regulation could have material adverse effect on bnsf business government may change the legislative and or regulatory

basis revenue and earnings could be adversely affected common carrier bnsf is also required to transport toxic inhalation hazard chemical and other hazardous material release of hazardous material could expose bnsf to significant claim loss penalty and environmental remediation obligation change in the regulation of the rail industry could negatively impact bnsf ability to determine price for

consolidated financial statement should be read in conjunction with this discussion the covid pandemic accelerated beginning in the second half of march most of our business were negatively affected with the effect to date ranging from relatively minor to severe revenue and earnings of most of our manufacturing service and retailing business declined considerably and in certain instance severely in the second quarter due to closure of facility where crowd gather such retail store restaurant and entertainment venue well from public travel restriction and from closure of certain of our business in each of the third and fourth quarter of several of these business experienced significant increase in revenue and earnings compared to the second quarter our business that were deemed essential continued to operate through the pandemic including our railroad utility and energy insurance and certain of our manufacturing wholesale distribution and service business in response to the effect of the pandemic our business implemented various business continuity plan to protect our employee and customer such plan include variety of action such temporarily closing certain retail store manufacturing facility and service center of business that were not subject to government mandated closure our business also implemented practice to protect employee while at work such practice included work from home staggered or reduced work schedule increased cleaning and sanitation of workspace providing employee health screening eliminating non essential travel and face to face meeting and providing general health reminder intended to lower the risk of spreading covid we also took action in response to the economic loss from reduction in consumer demand for product and service we

action intended to help mitigate the economic loss and preserve capital and liquidity certain of our business undertook and may continue to undertake restructuring activity to resize their operation to better fit expected customer demand we can not reliably predict future economic effect of the pandemic or when business activity at all of our numerous and diverse operation will normalize can we

reduced claim frequency for private passenger automobile insurance and increased loss estimate for certain commercial insurance and property and casualty reinsurance business management discussion and analysis continued result of operation continued after tax earnings from insurance investment income in declined million versus reflecting lower interest income primarily attributable to decline in

variety of factor revenue and pre tax earnings in of certain of these business were negatively affected by the unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation attributable to stronger dollar international trade tension and trade tariff investment and derivative gain loss in each of the three year presented included significant gain and loss on our investment in equity security including unrealized gain and loss from market price change on security we continue to hold we believe that investment and derivative gain loss whether realized from disposition or unrealized from change in market price of equity security are generally meaningless in understanding our reported result or evaluating the economic performance of our business these gain and loss have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings insurance underwriting our management view our insurance business possessing two distinct activity underwriting and investing underwriting decision are the responsibility of the unit manager while investing decision are the responsibility of berkshire chairman and ceo warren buffett and berkshire corporate investment manager accordingly we evaluate performance of underwriting operation without any allocation of investment income or investment gain loss we consider investment income an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating result however we consider investment gain and loss whether realized or unrealized non operating based on our long held strategy of acquiring security and holding those security for long period we believe that such gain and loss are not meaningful in understanding the operating result of our insurance business the timing and amount of catastrophe loss can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting result particularly with respect to our reinsurance business generally we consider pre tax loss in excess of million from current year catastrophic event to be significant change in estimate for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense including amount established for occurrence in prior year can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting result unpaid loss estimate including estimate under retroactive reinsurance contract were approximately billion of december our periodic underwriting result may also include significant foreign currency

property and casualty insurance unpaid loss we record liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense also referred to gross unpaid loss or claim liability based upon estimate of the ultimate amount payable for loss occurring on or before the balance sheet date the timing and amount of ultimate loss payment are contingent upon among other thing the timing of claim reporting from insured and ceding company and the final determination of the loss amount through the loss adjustment process we use variety of technique in establishing claim liability and all technique require significant judgment and assumption of the balance sheet date recorded claim liability include liability for reported claim and for claim not yet reported the period between the loss occurrence date and loss settlement date is the claim tail property claim usually have relatively short claim tail absent litigation casualty claim usually have longer claim tail occasionally extending for decade casualty claim may be more susceptible to litigation and the impact of changing contract interpretation the legal environment and judicial process further contribute to extending claim tail our consolidated claim liability of december were approximately billion including liability from retroactive reinsurance of which related to geico and the berkshire hathaway reinsurance group additional information regarding significant uncertainty inherent in the process and technique for estimating unpaid loss of these business follows geico geico predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance of december geico gross unpaid loss were billion and claim liability net of reinsurance recoverable were billion geico claim reserving methodology produce liability estimate based upon the individual claim the key assumption affecting our liability estimate include projection of ultimate claim count frequency and average loss per claim severity we utilize combination of several actuarial estimation method including bornhuetter ferguson and chain ladder methodology claim liability estimate for automobile liability coverage such bodily injury bi uninsured motorist and personal injury protection are more uncertain due to the longer claim tail so we establish additional case development estimate of december case development liability averaged approximately of the case reserve we select case development factor through analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case liability incurred but not reported ibnr claim liability are based on projection of the ultimate number of claim expected reported and unreported for each significant coverage we use historical claim count data to develop age to age projection of the ultimate count by quarterly accident period from which we deduct reported claim to produce the number of unreported claim we estimate the average cost per unreported claim and apply such estimate to the unreported claim count producing an ibnr liability estimate we may record additional ibnr estimate when actuarial technique are difficult to apply we test the adequacy of the aggregate claim liability using one or more actuarial projection based on claim closure model and paid and incurred loss triangle each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claim occurring in given period and project the ultimate cost our claim liability estimate recorded at the end of were reduced by million during which produced corresponding increase to pre tax earnings the assumption used to estimate liability at december reflect the most recent frequency and severity result future development of recorded liability will depend on whether actual frequency and severity of claim are more or le than anticipated management discussion and analysis continued property and casualty loss continued geico continued with respect to liability for bi claim we believe it is reasonably possible that average severity will change by at least one percentage point from the severity used in establishing the recorded liability at december we estimate that one percentage point increase or decrease in bi severity would produce million increase or decrease in recorded liability with corresponding decrease or increase in pre tax earnings many of the economic force that would likely cause bi severity to differ from expectation would likely also cause severity for other injury coverage to differ in the same direction berkshire hathaway reinsurance group bhrg liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense derive primarily from reinsurance contract issued through nico and general re summary of bhrg property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense other than retroactive reinsurance loss and loss adjustment expense of december follows in million property casualty total reported case liability ibnr liability gross unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reinsurance recoverable net unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense gross unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense consist primarily of traditional property and casualty coverage written primarily under excess of loss and quota share treaty under certain contract coverage can apply to multiple line of business written and the ceding company may not report loss data by such line consistently if at all in those instance we allocate loss to property and casualty coverage based on internal estimate in connection with reinsurance contract the nature extent timing and perceived reliability of loss information received from ceding company varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting term contract term condition and coverage also tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly than primary insurance policy the nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative individual risk or per occurrence excess contract may be comparable to the information received under primary insurance contract however loss information is often le detailed with respect to aggregate excess of loss and quota share contract and is often in summary format rather than on an individual claim basis loss data includes recoverable paid loss well case loss estimate ceding company infrequently provide reliable ibnr estimate to reinsurers loss reporting to reinsurers is typically slower in comparison to primary insurer in the such reporting is generally required at quarterly interval ranging from to day after the end of the quarterly period while outside of the reinsurance reporting practice may vary further in certain country client report annually from to day after the end of the annual period reinsurers may assume and cede underlying risk from other reinsurers which may further delay the reporting of claim the relative impact of reporting delay on the reinsurer may vary depending on the type of coverage contractual reporting term the magnitude of the claim relative to the attachment point of the reinsurance coverage and for other reason reinsurers the premium and loss data we receive is at least one level removed from the underlying claimant so there is risk that the loss data reported is incomplete inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage term we maintain certain internal procedure in order to determine that the information is complete and in compliance with the contract term generally our reinsurance contract permit to access the ceding company record with respect to the subject business thus providing the ability to audit the reported information in the normal course of business dispute occasionally arise concerning whether claim are covered by our reinsurance policy we resolve most coverage dispute through negotiation with the client if dispute can not be resolved our contract generally provide arbitration or alternative dispute resolution process there are no coverage dispute at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have material impact on our consolidated result of operation or financial condition management discussion and analysis continued property and casualty loss continued berkshire hathaway reinsurance group continued establishing claim liability estimate for reinsurance requires evaluation of loss information received from our client we generally rely on the ceding company reported case loss estimate we independently evaluate certain reported case loss and if appropriate we use our own case liability estimate for instance of december our case loss estimate exceeded ceding company estimate by approximately million for certain legacy worker compensation claim occurring over year ago we also periodically conduct detailed review of individual client claim which may cause to adjust our case estimate although liability for loss are initially determined based on pricing and underwriting analysis bhrg us variety of actuarial methodology that place reliance on the extrapolation of actual historical data loss development pattern industry data and other benchmark appropriate the estimate of the required ibnr liability also requires judgment by actuary and management to reflect the impact of additional factor like change in business mix volume claim reporting and handling practice inflation social and legal environment and the term and condition of the contract the methodology generally fall into one of the following category or are hybrid of one or more of the following category paid and incurred loss development method these method consider expected case loss emergence and development pattern together with expected loss ratio by year factor affecting our loss development analysis include but are not limited to change in the following client claim reporting and settlement practice the frequency of client company claim review policy term and coverage such loss retention level and occurrence and aggregate policy limit loss trend and legal trend that result in unanticipated loss collectively these factor influence our selection of expected case loss emergence pattern incurred and paid loss bornhuetter ferguson method these method consider actual paid and incurred loss and expected pattern of paid and incurred loss taking the initial expected ultimate loss into account to determine an estimate of the expected unpaid or unreported loss frequency and severity method these method commonly focus on review of the number of anticipated claim and the anticipated claim severity and may also rely on development pattern to derive such estimate however our process and technique for estimating liability in such analysis generally rely more on per policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss rather than with an analysis of historical development pattern of past loss additional analysis in some case we have established reinsurance claim liability on contract by contract basis determined from case loss estimate reported by the ceding company and ibnr liability that are primarily function of an anticipated loss ratio for the contract and the reported case loss estimate liability are adjusted upward or downward over time to reflect case loss reported versus expected case loss which we use to form revised judgement on the adequacy of the expected loss ratio and the level of ibnr liability required for unreported claim anticipated loss ratio are also revised to include estimate of known major catastrophe event our claim liability estimation process for short tail line primarily property exposure utilizes combination of the paid and incurred loss development method and the incurred and paid loss bornhuetter ferguson method certain catastrophe individual risk and aviation excess of loss contract tend to generate low frequency high severity loss our process and technique for estimating liability under such contract generally rely more on per contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development pattern of past loss for our long tail line primarily casualty exposure we may rely on different method depending on the maturity of the business with estimate for the most recent year being based on priced loss expectation and more mature year reflecting the paid or incurred development pattern indication in certain worker compensation claim reported loss were le than expected result we reduced estimated ultimate loss for prior year loss event by million we estimate that increase of ten percent in the tail of the expected loss emergence pattern and in the expected loss ratio would produce net increase of approximately billion in ibnr liability producing corresponding decrease in pre tax earnings we believe it is reasonably possible for these assumption to increase at these rate management discussion and analysis continued property and casualty loss continued berkshire hathaway reinsurance group continued for other casualty loss excluding asbestos environmental and other latent injury claim the overall change in estimate for prior year event wa not significant in however the potential for significant change in future period remains for certain significant casualty and general liability portfolio we estimate that increase of five percent in the claim tail of the expected loss emergence pattern and in the expected loss ratio would produce net increase in our nominal ibnr liability and corresponding reduction in pre tax earnings of approximately million although outcome of greater than or le than million are possible given the diversification in worldwide business estimated ultimate liability for asbestos environmental and other latent injury claim excluding amount assumed under retroactive reinsurance contract increased million in which produced corresponding reduction in pre tax earnings net liability for such claim were approximately billion at december loss estimation for these exposure are difficult to determine due to the changing legal environment and increase may be required in the future if new exposure or claimant are identified new claim are reported or new theory of liability emerge retroactive reinsurance our retroactive reinsurance contract cover loss event occurring before the contract inception date claim liability relating to our retroactive reinsurance contract are predominately related to casualty or liability exposure we expect the claim tail to be very long of december gross unpaid loss were billion and deferred charge asset were billion our contract are generally subject to maximum limit of indemnification and such we currently expect that maximum remaining gross loss payable under our retroactive policy will not exceed billion absent significant judicial or legislative change affecting asbestos environmental or latent injury exposure we also currently believe it unlikely that loss will develop upward to the maximum loss payable or downward by more than of our estimated gross liability we establish liability estimate by individual contract considering exposure and development trend in establishing our liability estimate we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment pattern and project expected ultimate loss under various scenario we assign judgmental probability factor to these scenario and an expected outcome is determined we then monitor subsequent loss payment activity and review ceding company report and other available information concerning the underlying loss we re estimate the expected ultimate loss when significant event or significant deviation from expected result are revealed certain of our retroactive reinsurance contract include asbestos environmental and other latent injury claim our estimated liability for such claim were approximately billion at december we do not consistently receive reliable detailed data regarding asbestos environmental and latent injury claim from all ceding company particularly with respect to multi line or aggregate excess of loss policy when possible we conduct detailed analysis of the underlying loss data to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured loss when detailed loss information is unavailable we develop estimate by applying recent industry trend and projection to aggregate client data judgment in these area necessarily consider the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which we expect claim will be adjudicated legal reform and legislation could also have significant impact on our ultimate liability we reduced estimated ultimate liability for prior year retroactive reinsurance contract by million in which after the change in related deferred charge asset resulted in pre tax earnings of million in we paid loss and loss adjustment expense of billion with respect to these contract management discussion and analysis continued property and casualty loss continued retroactive reinsurance continued in connection with our retroactive reinsurance contract we also record deferred charge asset which at contract inception represents the excess if any of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid loss over premium received we amortize deferred charge asset which produce charge to pre tax earnings in future period based on the expected timing and amount of loss payment we also adjust deferred charge balance due to change in the expected timing and ultimate amount of claim payment significant change in such estimate may have significant effect on unamortized deferred charge balance and the amount of periodic amortization based on the contract in effect of december we currently estimate that amortization expense in will approximate billion other critical accounting policy our consolidated balance sheet at december includes goodwill of acquired business of billion and other indefinite lived intangible asset of billion we evaluate these asset for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and on an interim basis if the fact and circumstance lead to believe that more likely not there ha been an impairment goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment review include determining the estimated fair value of our reporting unit and intangible asset the key assumption and input used in such determination may include forecasting revenue and expense cash flow and capital expenditure well an appropriate discount rate and other input significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of reporting unit and in performing impairment review due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flow and earnings over long period of time actual result may vary materially from the forecast if the carrying value of the indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds fair value the excess is charged to earnings an impairment loss if the carrying value of reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit then the excess limited to the carrying amount of goodwill will be charged to earnings an impairment loss in response to the adverse effect of the covid pandemic we considered whether goodwill needed to be reevaluated for impairment during the second quarter of we determined it wa necessary to quantitively reevaluate goodwill for impairment for certain reporting unit and most significantly for pcc result of our review we recorded pre tax goodwill impairment charge of billion and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charge of million of which approximately billion related to pcc prior to the reevaluation the carrying value of goodwill related to pcc wa approximately billion additionally the carrying value of pcc indefinite lived intangible asset wa approximately billion substantially all of these amount were recorded in connection with berkshire acquisition of pcc in the effect of the covid pandemic on commercial airline and aircraft manufacturer is particularly severe we considered number of factor in our reevaluation including but not limited to the announcement by airline concerning potential future demand employment level and aircraft order announcement by manufacturer on reduced aircraft production and the action we are taking or may take to restructure our operation to fit lower expected demand in our judgment the timing and extent of the recovery in the commercial airline and aerospace industry may be dependent on the development and wide scale distribution of medicine and vaccine that effectively treat the virus consequently we deemed it prudent under the prevailing circumstance to increase discount rate and reduce prior long term forecast of future cash flow for purpose of reviewing for impairment of december we concluded it is more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our consolidated balance sheet wa not impaired making estimate of the fair value of reporting unit at this time is and will likely be significantly affected by assumption on the severity duration or long term effect of the pandemic on the reporting unit business which we can not reliably predict consequently any fair value estimate in such instance can be subject to wide variation the effect of the covid pandemic could prove to be worse than we currently estimate and could lead to record additional goodwill or indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charge in we primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow method in determining fair value the key assumption and input used in such method may include forecasting revenue and expense cash flow and capital expenditure well an appropriate discount rate and other input significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of reporting unit and in performing goodwill impairment test management discussion and analysis continued market risk disclosure our consolidated balance sheet include substantial amount of asset and liability whose fair value are subject to market risk our significant market risk are primarily associated with equity price interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price

loss position we recognize loss in earnings for the excess of amortized cost over fair value if we intend to sell before the price recovers otherwise we evaluate of the balance sheet date whether the unrealized loss are attributable to credit loss or other factor we consider the severity of the decline in value creditworthiness of the issuer and other relevant factor we record an allowance for credit loss limited to the excess of amortized cost over fair value along with corresponding charge to earnings if the present value of estimated cash flow is le than the present value of contractual cash flow the allowance may be subsequently increased or decreased based on the prevailing fact and circumstance the portion of the unrealized loss that we believe is not related to credit loss is

considered probable based on the prevailing fact and circumstance beginning in measurement of expected credit loss include provision for non collection whether the risk is probable or remote expected credit loss on manufactured housing installment loan are based on the net present value of future principal payment le estimated expense related to the charge off and foreclosure of expected uncollectible loan and include provision for loan that are not in foreclosure our principal credit quality indicator is whether the loan are performing expected credit loss estimate consider historical default rate collateral recovery rate historical runoff rate interest rate reduction of future cash flow for modified loan and the historical time elapsed from last payment until foreclosure among other factor in addition our estimate consider current condition and reasonable and supportable forecast loan are considered delinquent when payment are more than day past due we place loan over day past due on nonaccrual status and accrued but uncollected interest is reversed subsequent collection on the loan are first applied to the principal and interest owed for the most delinquent amount we resume interest income accrual once loan is le than day delinquent loan are considered non performing when the foreclosure process ha started once loan is in the process of foreclosure interest income is not recognized unless the foreclosure is cured or the loan is modified once modification is complete interest income is recognized based on the term of the new loan

for newly reported physical damage and liability claim prior to establishing individual case reserve when insufficient time or information is available for specific claim estimate and for large volume of minor physical damage claim that once reported are quickly settled we establish case loss estimate for liability claim including estimate for loss adjustment expense the fact and merit of the claim are evaluated estimate for liability coverage are more uncertain than for physical damage coverage primarily due to the longer claim tail the greater chance of protracted litigation and the incompleteness of fact at the time the case estimate is first established the claim tail is the time period between the claim occurrence date and settlement date consequently we establish additional case development liability which are usually percentage of the case liability for unreported claim ibnr liability are estimated by projecting the ultimate number of claim expected reported and unreported for each significant coverage and deducting reported claim to produce estimated unreported claim the product of the average cost per unreported claim and the number of unreported claim
