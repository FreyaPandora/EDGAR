retail operation condition that adversely affect the general retail environment could materially and adversely affect our concentration in the retail real estate market our primary source of revenue is retail tenant mean that we could be materially and adversely affected by condition that materially and adversely affect the retail environment generally including without limitation level of consumer spending change in consumer confidence income level and fluctuation in seasonal spending in the united state and internationally consumer perception of the safety convenience and attractiveness of our property the impact on our retail tenant and demand for retail space at our property from the increasing use of the internet by retailer and consumer the creditworthiness of our

such government policy and regulation tariff energy price market dynamic rising interest rate and limited growth in consumer income increased operating cost and capital expenditure whether from redevelopment replacing tenant or otherwise and change in applicable law and regulation including tax environmental safety and zoning of our property depend on anchor store or other large nationally recognized tenant to attract shopper and we could be materially and adversely affected by the loss of one or more of these anchor or tenant our property are typically anchored by department store and other large nationally recognized tenant certain of our anchor and other tenant have ceased their operation downsized their brick and mortar presence or failed to comply with their contractual obligation to and others for example among department store and other national retailer often referred to big box store corporate merger activity typically result in the closure of duplicate or geographically overlapping store location further sustained adverse pressure on the result of our department store and other national retailer may have similarly sustained adverse impact upon our own result certain department store and other national retailer have experienced and may continue to experience for the foreseeable future given current macroeconomic uncertainty and le than desirable level of consumer confidence considerable decrease in customer traffic in their retail store increased competition from alternative retail option such those accessible via the internet and other form of pressure on their business model pressure on these department store and other national retailer increase their ability to maintain their store meet their obligation both to and to their external lender and supplier withstand takeover attempt or avoid bankruptcy and or liquidation may be impaired and result in closure of their store or their seeking of lease table of content modification with any lease modification could be unfavorable to the lessor and could decrease current or future effective rent or expense recovery charge other tenant may be entitled to modify the economic or other term of or terminate their existing lease with in the event of such closure if department store or large nationally recognized tenant were to close it store at our property we may experience difficulty and delay and incur significant expense in tenanting the space well in leasing space in area adjacent to the vacant store at attractive rate or at all additionally department store or tenant closure may result in decreased customer traffic which could lead to decreased sale at our property if the sale of store operating in our property were to decline significantly due to the closing of anchor store or other national retailer adverse economic condition or other reason tenant may be unable to pay their minimum rent or expense recovery charge in the event of any default by tenant we may not be able to fully recover and or may experience delay and cost in enforcing our right landlord to recover amount due to under the term of our lease with such party we face potential adverse effect from tenant bankruptcy bankruptcy filing by retailer can occur regularly in the course of our operation if tenant file for bankruptcy the tenant may have the right to reject and terminate one or more of it lease with and we can not be sure that it will affirm one or more of it lease and continue to make rental payment to in timely manner bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenant would generally prohibit from evicting this tenant and bar all effort by to collect pre bankruptcy debt from that tenant or from their property unless we receive an order permitting to do so from the bankruptcy court in addition we can not evict tenant solely because of it bankruptcy if lease is assumed by the tenant in bankruptcy all pre bankruptcy balance due under the lease must be paid to in full if lease is rejected the unsecured claim we hold bankrupt tenant might be paid to the extent that fund are available and only in the same percentage is paid to all other holder of unsecured claim and there are restriction under bankruptcy law that limit the amount of the claim we can make if lease is rejected result it is likely that we would recover substantially le than the full value of any unsecured claim we hold in addition we may make lease modification either pre or post bankruptcy for certain tenant undergoing significant financial distress in order for them to continue going concern furthermore we may be required to incur significant expense in re tenanting the space formerly leased to the bankrupt tenant we continually seek to re lease vacant space resulting from tenant termination the bankruptcy of tenant particularly an anchor tenant or national tenant with multiple location may require substantial redevelopment of their space the success of which can not be assured and may make the re tenanting of their space difficult and costly and it also may be more difficult to lease the remainder of the space at the affected property future tenant bankruptcy may strain our resource and impact our ability to successfully execute our re leasing strategy and could materially and adversely affect we face wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably our property compete with other retail property and other form of retailing such commerce website competition may come from mall outlet center community lifestyle center and other shopping center both existing well future development and redevelopment expansion project well commerce the presence of competitive alternative affect our ability to lease space and put downward pressure on the rent we can charge our tenant new construction redevelopment and expansion at competing site could also negatively affect our property we also compete with other major real estate investor and developer for attractive investment opportunity and prime development site competition for the acquisition of existing property and development site may result in increased purchase price and may adversely affect our ability to make attractive investment on favorable term or at all in addition we compete with other retail property company for tenant and qualified management excess space at our property could materially and adversely affect certain of our property have had excess space available for prospective tenant and those property may continue to experience and other property may commence experiencing such oversupply in the future among other cause there ha been an increased number of bankruptcy of anchor store and other national retailer well store closure and there ha been lower demand from retail tenant for space due to certain retailer increasing their use of commerce website to distribute their merchandise result of the increased bargaining power of creditworthy retail tenant there is downward pressure on our rental rate and occupancy level and this increased bargaining power may also result in to increase our spend on tenant improvement and potentially make other lease modification any of which in the aggregate could materially and adversely affect table of content we may not be able to lease newly developed property and renew lease and relet space at existing property we may not be able to lease new property to an appropriate mix of tenant that generates optimal customer traffic also lease for our existing property expire the premise may not be relet or the term of reletting including the cost of allowance and concession to tenant may be le favorable than the current lease term if we elect to pursue mixed use redevelopment we expose to risk associated with each non retail use eg office residential hotel and entertainment to the extent that our leasing goal are not achieved we could be materially and

mortgage lender and joint venture partner and those consent may be withheld if development or redevelopment expansion project is unsuccessful either because it is not meeting our expectation when operational or wa not completed according to the project planning we could lose our investment in the project further if we guarantee the property financing our loss could exceed our investment in the

represent substantial portion of our total consolidated asset these investment are relatively illiquid result our ability to sell one or more of our property or investment in real estate in response to any change in economic industry or other condition may be limited the real estate market is affected by many factor such general economic condition availability and term of financing interest rate and other factor including supply and demand for space that are beyond our control if we want to sell property we can not assure you that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or at all or that the sale price of property will be attractive at the relevant time or exceed the carrying value of our investment moreover if property is mortgaged we may not be able to obtain release of the lien on that property without the payment of the associated debt and or substantial prepayment penalty which could restrict our ability to dispose of the property even though the sale might otherwise be desirable risk relating to debt and the financial market we have substantial debt burden that could affect our future operation of december our consolidated mortgage and unsecured indebtedness excluding related premium discount and debt issuance cost totaled billion result of this indebtedness we are required to use substantial portion of our cash flow for debt service including selected repayment at scheduled maturity which limit our ability to use those cash flow to fund the growth of our business we are also subject to the risk normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow from operation will be insufficient to meet required debt service or that we will be able to refinance such indebtedness on acceptable term or at all our debt service cost generally will not be reduced if development at the applicable property such the entry of new competitor or the loss of major tenant cause reduction in the income from the property our indebtedness could also have other adverse consequence on including reducing our access to capital or increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic industry and market condition in addition if property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from such property is insufficient to pay that indebtedness the property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in loss of income and decline in our total asset value if any of the foregoing occurs we could be materially and adversely affected the agreement that govern our indebtedness contain various covenant that impose restriction on that might affect our ability to operate freely we have variety of unsecured debt including the credit facility senior unsecured note and commercial paper and secured property level debt certain of the agreement that govern our indebtedness contain covenant including among other thing limitation on our ability to incur secured and unsecured indebtedness sell all or substantially all of our asset and engage in merger and certain acquisition in addition certain of the agreement that govern our indebtedness contain financial covenant that require to maintain certain financial ratio including certain coverage ratio these covenant may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiative or certain transaction that might otherwise be advantageous to in addition our ability to comply with these provision might be affected by event beyond our control failure to comply with any of our financing covenant could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could accelerate the related indebtedness well other of our indebtedness which could have material adverse effect on table of content disruption in the capital and credit market may adversely affect our ability to access external financing for our growth and ongoing debt service requirement we depend on external financing principally debt financing to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturity of our outstanding debt our access to financing depends on the willingness of lending institution and other debt investor to grant credit to and condition in the capital market in general an economic recession may cause extreme volatility and disruption in the capital and credit market we rely upon the credit facility source of funding for numerous transaction our access to these fund is dependent upon the ability of each of the participant to the credit facility to meet their funding commitment to when market are volatile access to capital and credit market could be disrupted an extended period of time and one or more financial institution may not have the available capital to meet their previous commitment to the failure of one or more participant to the credit facility to meet their funding commitment to could have material adverse effect on including result of making it difficult to obtain the financing we may need for future growth and or meeting our debt service requirement we can not assure you that we will be able to obtain the financing we need for the future growth of our business or to meet our debt service requirement or that sufficient amount of financing will be available to on favorable term or at all adverse change in our credit rating could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing term the operating partnership outstanding senior unsecured note credit facility the commercial paper program and simon preferred stock are periodically rated by nationally recognized credit rating agency the credit rating are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratio financial condition and prospect and other factor viewed by the credit rating agency relevant to and our industry and the economic outlook in general our credit rating can affect the amount of capital we can access well the term of any financing we obtain since we depend primarily on debt financing to fund the growth of our business an adverse change in our credit rating including actual change and change in outlook or even the initiation of review of our credit rating that could result in an adverse change could have material adverse effect on an increase in interest rate would increase our interest cost on variable rate debt and could adversely impact our ability to refinance existing debt on attractive term or at all our hedging interest rate protection arrangement may not effectively limit our interest rate risk of december we had approximately million of outstanding consolidated indebtedness that bear interest at variable rate and we may incur more variable rate indebtedness in the future if interest rate increase then so would the interest cost on our unhedged variable rate debt which could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our ability to make distribution to our stockholder further rising interest rate could limit our ability to refinance existing debt when it matures or significantly increase our future interest expense we selectively manage our exposure to interest rate risk by combination of interest rate protection agreement to effectively fix or cap all or portion of our variable rate debt in addition we refinance fixed rate debt at time when we believe rate and other term are appropriate our effort to manage these exposure may not be successful our use of interest rate hedging arrangement to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose to additional risk including risk that counterparty to hedging arrangement may fail to honor it obligation or that we could be required to fund our contractual payment obligation under such arrangement in relatively large amount or on short notice developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate from risk associated with interest rate fluctuation there can be no assurance that our hedging activity will have the desired beneficial impact on our result of operation liquidity and financial condition termination of these hedging agreement typically involves cost such transaction fee or breakage cost risk relating to income tax simon and certain subsidiary of the operating partnership have elected to be taxed reit in the united state and certain international operation also are structured to be taxed in manner similar to the reit structure the failure to maintain simon or these subsidiary qualification reit or change in local tax law or regulation in certain of our international operation could result in adverse tax consequence we are subject to certain income based tax both domestically and internationally and other tax including state and local tax franchise tax and withholding tax on dividend from certain of our international investment we table of content currently follow local tax law and regulation in various domestic and international jurisdiction should these law or regulation change the amount of tax we pay may increase accordingly in the united state simon and certain subsidiary of the operating partnership have elected to be taxed reit under section through of the internal revenue code we believe simon and these subsidiary have been organized and operated in manner which allows them to qualify for taxation reit under the internal revenue code we intend to continue to operate in this manner however qualification and taxation reit depend upon the ability of simon and these subsidiary to satisfy several requirement some of which are outside our control including test related to our annual operating result asset diversification distribution level and diversity of stock ownership the various reit qualification test required by the internal revenue code are highly technical and complex accordingly there can be no assurance that simon or any of these subsidiary ha operated in accordance with these requirement or will continue to operate in manner so to qualify or remain qualified reit if simon or any of these subsidiary fail to comply with those provision simon or any such subsidiary may be subject to monetary penalty or ultimately to possible disqualification reit if such event occur and if available relief provision do not apply simon or any such subsidiary will not be allowed deduction for distribution to stockholder in computing taxable income simon or any such subsidiary will be subject to corporate level income tax on taxable income at the corporate rate and unless entitled to relief under relevant statutory provision simon or any such subsidiary will also be disqualified from treatment reit for the four taxable year following the year during which qualification wa lost any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for among other thing our operation and distribution to stockholder in addition if simon fails to qualify reit it will not be required to make distribution to our stockholder moreover failure by any subsidiary of the operating partnership that ha elected to be taxed reit to qualify reit would also cause simon to fail to qualify reit and the same adverse consequence would apply to it and it stockholder failure by simon or any of these subsidiary to qualify reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital which could materially and adversely affect the tax imposed on reit engaging in prohibited transaction may limit our ability to engage in transaction which would be treated sale for federal income tax purpose reit net income from prohibited transaction is subject to penalty tax in general prohibited transaction are sale or other disposition of property other than foreclosure property held primarily for sale to customer in the ordinary course of business although we do not intend to hold any property that would be characterized held for sale to customer in the ordinary course of our business unless sale or disposition qualifies under certain statutory safe harbor such characterization is factual determination and no guarantee can be given that the internal revenue service or the irs would agree with our characterization of our property or that we will always be able to make use of the available safe harbor reit distribution requirement could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our business plan in order for simon and certain subsidiary of the operating partnership to qualify to be taxed reit and assuming that certain other requirement are also satisfied simon and each such subsidiary generally must distribute at least of their respective reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividend paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain to their respective equity holder each year to this point simon and each such subsidiary have historically distributed at least of taxable income and thereby avoided income tax altogether to the extent that simon or any such subsidiary satisfies this distribution requirement and qualifies for taxation reit but distributes le than of it reit taxable income simon or any such subsidiary will be subject to federal corporate income tax on it undistributed net taxable income and could be subject to nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that is distributed to equity holder in calendar year is le than the required minimum distribution amount specified under federal income tax law we intend to make distribution to the equity holder of simon and the aforementioned subsidiary of the operating partnership to comply with the reit requirement of the internal revenue code from time to time simon and the aforementioned subsidiary of the operating partnership might generate taxable income greater than their respective cash flow result of difference in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditure the creation of reserve or required debt table of content or amortization payment if simon and these subsidiary do not have other fund available in these situation simon and these subsidiary could be required to access capital on unfavorable term the receipt of which can not be assured sell asset at disadvantageous price distribute amount that would otherwise be invested in future acquisition capital expenditure or repayment of debt or make taxable distribution of capital stock or debt security to make distribution sufficient to enable them to pay enough of their respective reit taxable income to satisfy the reit distribution requirement and avoid corporate income tax and the excise tax in particular year these alternative could increase cost or reduce our equity further amount distributed will not be available to fund the growth of our business thus compliance with the reit requirement may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our business plan complying with reit requirement might cause to forego otherwise attractive acquisition opportunity or liquidate otherwise attractive investment to qualify to be taxed reit for federal income tax purpose simon and certain subsidiary of the operating partnership must ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least of the value of their respective asset consist of cash cash item government security and real estate asset defined in the internal revenue code including certain mortgage loan and security the remainder of their respective investment other than government security qualified real estate asset and security issued by taxable reit subsidiary or trs generally can not include more than of the outstanding voting security of any one issuer or more than of the total value of the outstanding security of any one issuer additionally in general no more than of the value of simon and these subsidiary total asset other than government security qualified real estate asset and security issued by trs can consist of the security of any one issuer and no more than of the value of their respective total asset can be represented by security of one or more trss if simon or any of these subsidiary fails to comply with these requirement at the end of any calendar quarter simon or any such subsidiary must correct the failure within day after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provision to avoid losing it reit qualification and suffering adverse tax consequence result we might be required to liquidate or forego otherwise attractive investment these action could have the effect of reducing our income and amount available for distribution to equity holder in addition to the asset test set forth above to qualify to be taxed reit simon and these subsidiary must continually satisfy test concerning among other thing the source of their respective income the amount they distribute to equity holder and the ownership of their respective share we might be unable to pursue investment that would be otherwise advantageous to in order to satisfy the source of income or asset diversification requirement for qualifying reit thus compliance with the reit requirement may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investment partnership tax audit rule could have material adverse effect on the bipartisan budget act of change the rule applicable to federal income tax audit of partnership under the rule among other change and subject to certain exception any audit adjustment to item of income gain loss deduction or credit of partnership and any partner distributive share thereof is determined and tax interest or penalty attributable thereto could be assessed and collected at the partnership level absent available election it is possible that partnership in which we directly or indirectly invest could be required to pay additional tax interest and penalty result of an audit adjustment and we direct or indirect partner of these partnership could be required to bear the economic burden of those tax interest and penalty even though simon and certain subsidiary of the operating partnership reit may not otherwise have been required to pay additional corporate level tax had they owned the asset of the partnership directly the partnership tax audit rule apply to the operating partnership and it subsidiary that are classified partnership for federal income tax purpose the change created by these rule are sweeping and accordingly there can be no assurance that these rule will not have material adverse effect on legislative administrative regulatory or other action affecting reit including position taken by the irs could have material adverse effect on and our investor the rule dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by person involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the department of the treasury or the treasury change to the tax law or interpretation thereof by the irs and the treasury with or without retroactive application could materially and adversely affect and our investor new legislation including the recently enacted tax cut and job act or the tcja and any technical correction legislation treasury regulation administrative interpretation or court decision could significantly and negatively affect the ability of simon and certain subsidiary of the operating partnership to qualify to be taxed reit and or the federal income tax consequence to and our investor of such qualification table of content the tcja ha significantly changed the federal income taxation of business and their owner including reit and their stockholder change made by the tcja that could affect and our stockholder is that it generally

contribution partner or other owner could have economic or other business interest or goal that are inconsistent with our own business interest or goal and could be in position to take action contrary to our policy or objective these investment and other future similar investment also have the potential risk of creating impasse on decision such sale or financing because neither we our partner or other owner ha full control over the partnership or joint venture dispute between and partner or other owner might result in litigation or arbitration that could increase our expense and prevent simon officer and or director from focusing their time and effort on our business consequently action by or dispute with partner or other owner might result in subjecting property owned by the partnership

contingent asset and liability at the date of the financial statement and the reported amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period if our judgment or interpretation of the fact and circumstance relating to various transaction had been different it is possible that different accounting policy would have been applied resulting in different presentation of our financial statement from time to time we reevaluate our estimate and assumption in the event estimate or assumption prove to be different from actual result adjustment are made in subsequent period to reflect more current information below is discussion of accounting policy that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimate about matter that are inherently uncertain for summary of our significant accounting policy see note of the note to the consolidated financial statement we lessor retain substantially all of the risk and benefit of ownership of the investment property and account for our lease operating lease we accrue minimum rent on straight line basis over the term of their respective lease substantially all of our retail tenant are also required to pay overage rent based on sale over stated base amount during the lease year we recognize overage rent only when each tenant sale exceed it sale threshold we review investment property for impairment on property by property basis whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of investment property may not be recoverable these circumstance include but are not limited to decline in property cash flow occupancy or comparable sale per square foot we measure any impairment of investment property when the estimated undiscounted operating income depreciation and amortization plus it residual value is le than the carrying value of the property to the extent impairment ha occurred we charge to income the excess of carrying value of the property over it estimated fair value we may decide to sell property that are held for use and the sale price of these property may differ from their carrying value we also review our investment including investment in unconsolidated entity if event or circumstance change indicating that the carrying amount of our investment may not be recoverable we will record an impairment charge if we determine that decline in the fair value of the investment below carrying value is other than temporary change in economic and operating condition that occur subsequent to our review of recoverability of investment property and other investment could impact the assumption used in that assessment and could result in future charge to earnings if assumption regarding those investment differ from actual result to maintain simon status reit we must distribute at least of reit taxable income in any given year and meet certain asset and income test we monitor our business and transaction that may potentially impact simon reit status in the unlikely event that we fail to maintain simon reit status and available relief provision do not apply we would be required to pay federal income tax at regular corporate income tax rate during the period simon did not qualify reit if simon lost it reit status it could not elect to be taxed reit for four taxable year following the year during which qualification wa lost unless it failure wa due to reasonable cause and certain other condition were met result failing to maintain reit status would result in significant increase in the income tax expense recorded and paid during those period we make estimate part of our valuation of the purchase price of asset acquisition including the component of excess investment in joint venture to the various component of the acquisition based upon the relative fair table of content value of each component the most significant component of our valuation are typically the determination of relative fair value to the building if vacant land and market value of in place lease in the case of the fair value of building and fair value of land and other intangible our estimate of the value of these component will affect the amount of depreciation or amortization we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term in the case of the market value of in place lease we make our best estimate of the tenant ability to pay rent based upon the tenant operating performance at the property including the competitive position of the property in it market well sale psf rent psf and overall occupancy cost for the tenant in place at the acquisition date our assumption affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired in place lease variety of cost are incurred in the development and leasing of property after determination is made to capitalize cost it is allocated to the specific component of project that is benefited determination of when development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves judgment the cost of land and building under development include specifically identifiable cost the capitalized cost include pre construction cost essential to the development of the property development cost construction cost interest

licensing fee earned from various international property sale of real estate including land parcel and operating property and other ancillary income earned at our property the amount and timing of revenue recognition from our service to joint venture licensing fee arrangement and ancillary income under the newly effective standard is consistent with the prior measurement and pattern of recognition in addition we do not actively sell operating property part of our core business strategy and accordingly the sale of property doe not generally constitute significant part of our revenue and cash flow we adopted the standard using the modified retrospective approach on january and there wa no cumulative effect adjustment recognized our revenue impacted by this standard are included in management fee and other revenue and in other income in the accompanying consolidated statement of operation and comprehensive income in january the fasb issued asu financial instrument overall recognition and measurement of financial asset and financial liability which requires entity to recognize change in equity investment with readily determinable fair value in net income we recognized

determinable fair value that were previously accounted for available for sale security and certain equity instrument previously accounted for using the cost method for which the measurement alternative described below wa not elected for those equity instrument that do not have readily determinable fair value the asu permit the application of measurement alternative using the cost of the

occurrence of an event which establishes fair value to all other equity instrument we account for using the measurement alternative in february the fasb issued asu lease which will result in lessee recognizing most leased asset and corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet lessor accounting will remain substantially similar to the current accounting however certain refinement were made to conform the standard with the recently issued revenue recognition guidance in asu specifically related to the allocation and recognition of contract consideration earned from lease and non lease

where indicated in million or billion non lease component identified in our lease arrangement are accounted for using the guidance in asu which for new and amended lease we have determined would

component consideration received from fixed common area maintenance arrangement on straight line basis and iii require separate presentation of revenue recognized from lease and non lease component on our statement of operation and comprehensive income however on july the fasb issued asu which created practical expedient that provides lessor an option not to separate lease and non lease component when certain criterion are met and instead account for those component single lease component we determined that our new and amended lease arrangement will meet the criterion under the practical expedient to account for lease and non lease component single lease component which alleviates the requirement upon adoption of asu that we reallocate or separately present lease and non lease component result we will recognize consideration received from fixed common area maintenance arrangement on straight line basis for new or amended lease this consideration is attributed to the lease component further asu requires recognition in our consolidated balance sheet of lease of land and other arrangement where we are the lessee upon adoption on january we recognized right of use asset and corresponding lease liability of million representing the present value of future lease payment required under our lessee arrangement we utilized lease term ranging from to including period for

provides for simplified accounting model for purchased financial asset with credit deterioration since their origination instrument in scope include loan held to maturity debt security and net investment in lease well reinsurance and trade receivables in november the fasb issued asu which clarifies that operating lease receivables are outside the scope of the new standard this standard will

fasb issued asu other income gain and loss from the derecognition of nonfinancial asset which clarifies the scope and application of accounting standard codification on the sale or transfer of nonfinancial asset and in substance asset to noncustomers including partial sale the standard generally aligns the measurement of retained interest in nonfinancial asset with that of retained interest in business it also eliminates the use of the carryover basis for contribution of real estate into joint venture where control of the real estate is not retained which will result in the recognition of gain or loss upon contribution we adopted the standard using the modified retrospective approach on january and there wa no cumulative effect adjustment to recognize in august the fasb issued asu derivative and hedging topic targeted improvement to accounting for hedging activity which introduced amendment to the hedge accounting model to allow for better alignment with risk management practice in addition to simplifying the hedge accounting model the provision may permit more risk management strategy to qualify for hedge accounting including interest rate hedge and foreign currency
