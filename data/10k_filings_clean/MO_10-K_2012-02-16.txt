regulation in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation in the annual report we can not predict how the fda will implement and enforce it statutory authority including by promulgating additional regulation and pursuing possible investigatory or enforcement action governmental action combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking and private action to restrict smoking have resulted in reduced cigarette industry volume and we expect that these factor will continue to reduce cigarette consumption level action by the fda or other federal state or local government or agency may impact the consumer acceptability of tobacco product limit adult consumer choice delay or prevent the launch of new or modified tobacco product restrict

tobacco containing and nicotine containing product that reduce or eliminate exposure to cigarette smoke and or constituent identified by public health authority harmful these effort may include arrangement with third party moreover these effort may not succeed if they do not succeed one or more of their competitor doe our subsidiary may be at competitive disadvantage further we can not predict whether regulator including the fda will permit the marketing or sale of such product with claim of reduced risk to consumer or whether consumer purchase decision would be affected by such claim which could affect the commercial viability of any such product that might be developed adjacency strategy altria group inc and it subsidiary have adjacency growth strategy involving move and
