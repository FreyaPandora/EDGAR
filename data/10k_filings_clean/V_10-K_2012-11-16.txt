standard through agreement with and in certain case non equity membership interest in our subsidiary these rule and standard relate to such matter the use of our brand and trademark the standard design and feature of payment card device and program processing merchant acquiring activity including use of agent dispute between member risk management settlement indemnification client financial failure and allocation of loss among client we establish and administer dispute management procedure between client relating to specific transaction for example transaction is presented to an issuer the issuer may determine that the transaction is invalid for variety of reason including fraud if the issuer belief there is defect in transaction the issuer may return the transaction to the acquirer an action termed chargeback we enforce rule relating to chargebacks and maintain dispute resolution process with respect to chargeback dispute credit risk management we indemnify issuer and acquirer for any settlement loss suffered due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to fund it daily settlement obligation in certain instance we may indemnify client even in situation in which transaction is not processed by our system we have incurred no material loss related to settlement risk in recent year see item risk factor we risk loss or insolvency if our client fail to fund settlement obligation for which we have provided indemnification to manage our exposure in the event our client fail to fund their settlement obligation we established credit risk policy with formalized set of credit standard and risk control measure we regularly evaluate client with significant settlement exposure to ass risk in certain instance we may require client to post collateral or provide other guarantee if client becomes unable or unwilling to meet it obligation we are able to draw upon such collateral or guarantee in order to minimize any potential loss we may also apply other risk control measure such blocking the authorization and settlement of transaction limiting the use of certain type of agent prohibiting initiation of acquiring relationship with certain high risk merchant or suspending or terminating client right to participate in our payment network the exposure to settlement loss through our indemnification of contentsis accounted for settlement risk guarantee the fair value of the settlement risk guarantee is estimated using our proprietary model which considers statistically derived loss factor based on historical experience estimated settlement exposure at period end and standardized grading process for client using where available third party estimate of the probability of customer failure see item financial statement and supplementary data note settlement guarantee management elsewhere in this report payment system integrity the integrity of our payment system is affected by fraudulent activity and other illegal us of our product fraud is most often committed in connection with counterfeit card or card not present transaction using stolen account information resulting from security breach of system not associated with visanet that store process or transmit cardholder or account data including system operated by merchant financial institution and other third party data processor our fraud detection and prevention offering include verified by visa global internet authentication product which permit cardholder to authenticate to their issuing financial institution using unique personal code visa advanced authorization which provides enhanced fraud detection capability by adding real time risk score to authorization message chip technology embedded microprocessor that provide enhanced security and reduce the incidence of counterfeit card fraud result visa ha created incentive for merchant and issuer to adopt them including in the united state chip technology can also carry other application that enhance the consumer payment experience and cybersource decision manager solution which provides access to over validation test to ass the legitimacy of card not present order we work with all participant in the payment system to ensure that any entity that transmits process or store sensitive card information take necessary step to secure that data and protect cardholder for example we mandate protection of pin data through use of the triple data encryption standard and work with the payment industry to manage the payment card industry data security standard pci ds there ha been significant progress in growing industry adoption of pci ds with more than percent of the largest merchant validating compliance annually government regulation general government regulation affect key aspect of our business our client are also subject to numerous regulation applicable to bank and other financial institution in the united state and elsewhere and consequently such regulation have the potential to affect our business indirectly in recent year our business ha come under increasing regulatory scrutiny see item risk factor increased global regulatory focus on the payment industry may result in costly new compliance burden on our client and on leading to increased cost and decreased payment volume and revenue the dodd frank act noted during the fiscal year the federal reserve established new rule under the dodd frank act affecting interchange reimbursement fee network exclusivity and transaction routing we expect these rule which include provision effective in our fiscal and to continue to have an adverse impact on our pricing reduce the number and volume of debit payment we process and decrease associated revenue see item risk factor the dodd frank act may continue to have material adverse impact on our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business and item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation overview we have significantly modified our debit strategy result see overview interchange reimbursement fee we have historically set default interchange reimbursement fee in the united state and many other geography the new rule under the dodd frank act set the maximum debit interchange reimbursement fee assessed for card issued by large financial institution at twenty one cent plus five basis point before applying fraud adjustment of up to an additional one cent this amount to significant reduction from the average system wide fee charged previously see item risk factor the dodd frank act may continue to have material adverse impact on our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business and item risk factor additional regulation of interchange of contentsreimbursement fee may have material adverse impact on our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business the united state is not the only jurisdiction to regulate debit interchange reimbursement fee for example the reserve bank of australia ha enacted regulation limiting the cost that can be considered in setting interchange reimbursement fee for both our credit and our debit card interchange reimbursement fee represent transfer of value among the financial institution participating in an open loop payment network such on purchase transaction interchange reimbursement fee are paid to issuer by acquirer in connection with transaction initiated from product in our payment system we generally do not receive any portion of interchange reimbursement fee in transaction they are however factor on which we compete with other payment provider and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transaction we process default interchange reimbursement fee are an important driver of system volume and value they promote the efficient operation of our payment network by enabling both the issuer and the acquirer to understand the economics of given transaction before entering into it and by giving our client an alternative to negotiating transfer pricing with each other by establishing and modifying default interchange rate in response to marketplace condition and strategic demand we seek to ensure competitive value proposition for transaction using our card in order to encourage electronic transaction and to maximize participation in the visa payment system by issuer and acquirer and ultimately consumer and merchant we believe that proper management of interchange rate benefit consumer merchant our financial institution client and by promoting the overall growth of our payment network in competition with other payment card system and other form of payment and by creating incentive for innovation enhanced data quality and security merchant do not directly pay interchange reimbursement fee merchant cost of acceptance is determined by it acquirer and is called merchant discount or merchant discount rate the merchant discount typically cover the cost that acquirer incur for participation in open loop payment network including those relating to interchange and compensates them for various other service they provide to merchant merchant discount rate and other merchant fee are set by our acquirer without our involvement and by agreement with their merchant client and are established in competition with other acquirer other payment card system and other form of payment we do not establish or regulate the level of merchant discount rate or any other fee charged by our acquirer in some case such india the governing authority have regulated the merchant discount rate rather than the interchange reimbursement fee network exclusivity and routing we have historically agreement with some issuer under which they agree to issue certain payment card that use only the visa network or receive incentive if they do so in addition issuer of some debit product outside the united state have historically chosen to include only the visa network we refer to these various practice network exclusivity the dodd frank act limit our and issuer ability to impose rule for or choose various form of network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit area see item the dodd frank act may continue to have material adverse impact on our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business another example the canadian ministry of finance ha implemented voluntary code of conduct for payment card industry participant with which visa ha agreed to comply among other thing the code of conduct prohibits certain restriction on merchant choice of payment option they will accept see item risk factor additional regulation that prohibit from contracting with client or requiring them to use only our network or that deny them the option of selecting only our network may decrease the number of transaction we process materially and adversely affecting our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business consumer financial protection bureau the dodd frank act created new independent consumer financial protection bureau with responsibility for most federal consumer protection law in the area of financial service and new authority with respect to consumer protection issue including those pertaining to to some extent the bureau future action may make payment card transaction le attractive to card issuer consumer and merchant by regulating the industry no surcharge rule we have historically implemented policy that prohibit merchant from charging higher price to consumer pay using visa instead of other mean some local jurisdiction have taken step to limit these no surcharge rule for example the reserve bank of australia enacted regulation that prohibited from enforcing our no surcharge policy and effectively allowed merchant to impose discretionary surcharge on visa of contentstransactions without limitation recently the reserve bank of australia while reinforcing it position that surcharging is appropriate in that market ha taken step that would allow to limit the level of surcharge that merchant can impose additionally in the united state there are ten state that prohibit the use of the surcharge an anti consumer practice through their state legislature data protection and information security we devote substantial resource to maintain and to continually refine our information security program in order to comply with federal and state and foreign regulation safeguarding cardholder information and requiring consumer notification in the event of security breach in addition the federal financial institution examination council periodically review certain of our operation in the united state to examine our compliance with data integrity security and operational requirement and standard well other requirement applicable to because of our role service provider to financial institution anti money laundering anti terrorism and sanctioned country in response to and other regulation we devote substantial resource to maintain and to continually refine program to prevent the use of our payment system to facilitate money laundering and the financing of terrorist activity we also prohibit from being visa member all financial institution that are domiciled in country sanctioned by the treasury office of foreign asset control currently cuba iran syria and sudan in addition we refrain from any financial dealing with restricted third party such identified money laundering front for terrorist and narcotic trafficker government imposed market participation influence and restriction our business reach remains limited by certain government influence on domestic payment competition and or protection of domestic payment card provider or payment processing provider most notably none of our financial institution client in china have received authorization to issue card carrying only our brand for domestic use in china limiting our opportunity in that market regulator in an increasing number of country around the world including recently thailand ukraine the uae mexico colombia and russia have received statutory authority to regulate certain aspect of the payment system in these country regulation of internet transaction many jurisdiction have adopted or are in the process of adopting new regulation and tax on internet transaction most notably we have had to implement

regulatory initiative in the area of internet prescription drug purchase copyright and trademark infringement and privacy among others that could impose additional compliance burden on and or our client some state are considering variety of similar legislation if implemented these initiative could require or our client to monitor filter restrict or otherwise oversee various category of payment card transaction thereby increasing our cost or decreasing our transaction volume various regulatory agency also continue to examine wide variety of issue including identity theft account management guideline privacy disclosure rule security and marketing that would affect our client directly these new requirement and development may affect our client ability to extend credit by using payment

reimbursement fee may have material adverse impact on our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business interchange reimbursement fee represent transfer of value among the financial institution participating in payment network such ours in connection with transaction initiated with product in our payment system interchange reimbursement fee are typically paid to issuer the financial institution that issue visa card to cardholder the fee are typically paid by acquirer the financial institution that offer visa network connectivity and payment acceptance service to merchant we refer to system like ours in which payment network intermediate between the issuer and the acquirer an open loop system we generally do not receive any portion of interchange reimbursement fee in transaction they are however factor on which we compete with other payment provider and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transaction we process consequently change to these fee can substantially affect our revenue and the pace or breadth of overall payment electronification we have historically set default interchange reimbursement fee in the united state and many other geography however in certain jurisdiction interchange rate and related practice are subject to continuing or increased government regulation the dodd frank act ha already resulted in limitation on our ability to establish default interchange rate in the debit area in the united state see the dodd frank act may continue to have material adverse impact on our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business in addition interchange rate have become subject to continued or increased scrutiny elsewhere of contentsand regulatory authority and central bank in number of jurisdiction have reviewed or are reviewing these rate these jurisdiction include australia canada brazil and south africa we can not set default interchange rate at optimal level issuer and acquirer find our payment system le attractive this lower overall transaction volume and slows growth of transaction it also may increase the attractiveness of closed loop payment system those with direct connection to both merchant and consumer and other form of payment in addition we believe some issuer are charging new or higher fee to consumer in some instance this make our card program le desirable and reduces our transaction volume and profitability some acquirer elect to charge higher discount rate to merchant regardless of the level of visa interchange leading merchant not to accept card for payment or to steer visa cardholder to alternate payment system in addition some issuer and acquirer have obtained and may continue to obtain incentive from and reduction in the fee that we charge in an effort to reduce the expense of their card program for these reason additional regulation of interchange reimbursement fee may have material adverse impact on our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business additional regulation that prohibit from contracting with client or requiring them to use only our network or that deny them the option of selecting only our network may decrease the number of transaction we process materially and adversely affecting our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business in order to give visa branded cardholder consistent experience we promote certain practice to ensure that visa branded card are processed over our network we have historically had agreement with some issuer under which they agree to issue certain payment card that use only the visa network or receive incentive if they do so in addition certain issuer of some product have historically chosen to include only the visa network we refer to these various practice network exclusivity in addition certain network or issuer rule or practice may be interpreted limiting the routing option of merchant when multiple debit network co reside on visa debit card for example visa rule require that an acquirer must process authorization for all international transaction through visanet and that member must clear international transaction through visanet these are commonly referred to routing rule the dodd frank act already limit our and issuer ability to impose rule for or choose various form of network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit area see the dodd frank act may continue to have material adverse impact on our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business future regulation like the dodd frank act in the united state and elsewhere could materially decrease the number of transaction we process in order to retain that transaction volume we would have to reduce the fee we charge to issuer or acquirer or increase the payment and other incentive we provide to issuer or acquirer or directly to merchant any of these eventuality could have material adverse effect on our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business the dodd frank act may continue to have material adverse impact on our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business of october in accordance with the dodd frank act the federal reserve capped the maximum debit interchange fee charged by large financial institution at twenty one cent plus five basis point before applying an interim fraud adjustment up to an additional one cent this amounted to significant reduction from the average system wide fee charged previously the federal reserve also issued regulation requiring issuer to make at least two unaffiliated network available for processing debit transaction on each debit card the rule also prohibit and issuer from restricting merchant ability to direct the routing of electronic debit transaction over any of the network that an issuer ha enabled to process those transaction these regulation have adversely affected our debit business and associated revenue they created negative pressure on our pricing reduced the volume and number of debit payment we process and diminished associated revenue and although we believe we have now absorbed their principal impact they could continue to do so these pressure have arisen through various channel number of our client obtained fee reduction or increased incentive from to offset their own lost revenue some reduced the number of debit card they issue and investment they make in marketing and reward program some imposed new or higher fee on debit card or demand deposit account relationship some elected to issue fewer card enabled with visa affiliated network many merchant have used the routing regulation to redirect transaction or steer cardholder to other network of contentsbased on lowest cost or other factor other client and merchant are likely to take similar action in the future the dodd frank act created new independent consumer financial protection bureau with responsibility for most federal consumer protection law in the area of financial service and new authority with respect to consumer protection issue including those pertaining to to some extent although the bureau future action may benefit consumer these action may also make payment card transaction le attractive to card issuer consumer and merchant by further regulating disclosure payment card practice fee routing and other matter with respect to credit debit and prepaid some element of the dodd frank act lack definition and create the potential for network to pursue different strategy subject to their interpretation of the regulation our interpretation may result in our pursuit of strategy le effective than those of our competitor overall the regulation and development arising from the dodd frank act could continue to have material adverse effect on our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business new regulation or legal action in one jurisdiction or of one product segment may lead to new regulation in other jurisdiction or of other product regulator around the world increasingly note each other approach to the regulation of the payment industry consequently development in any one country state or region may influence regulatory approach in another the dodd frank act is one development with such potential similarly new law and regulation in country state or region involving one product segment may cause lawmaker there to extend the regulation to another product for example regulation like those affecting debit payment could eventually spread to regulate credit result the risk created by any one new law or regulation are magnified by the potential they have to be replicated affecting our business in another place or involving another product segment these include matter like interchange reimbursement fee network exclusivity preferred routing dynamic currency conversion point of sale transaction rule and practice and operating regulation conversely if widely varying regulation come into existence worldwide we may have difficulty adjusting our product service and fee and other important aspect of our business either of these eventuality could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation government action may prevent from competing effectively against provider of domestic payment service in certain country materially and adversely affecting our ability to maintain or increase our revenue government in some country provide resource or protection to select domestic payment card network brand and processing provider these government may take this action in order to support these provider they may also take this action to keep from entering these country to force to leave or to restrict substantially our activity there for example the government of china continues to maintain regulation that substantially favor china union pay the only retail payment network currently operating in the chinese domestic market additionally government in some country may consider regulatory requirement that mandate processing of domestic payment entirely in that country this would prevent from utilizing our global processing capability for our client our effort to effect change in these country may not succeed this could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenue and extend our global brand regulation in the area of consumer privacy and data use and security could decrease the number of payment card issued our payment volume and our revenue recently privacy data use and security have received heightened legislative and regulatory focus in the united state and elsewhere for example in many jurisdiction consumer must be notified in the event of data breach these measure may increase our and our client cost they may also decrease the number of visa branded card our client issue this would materially and adversely affect our profitability in addition our failure or the failure of our client to comply with these law and regulation could result in fine sanction litigation and damage to our global reputation and our brand increased global regulatory focus on the payment industry may result in costly new compliance burden on our client and on leading to increased cost and decreased payment volume and revenue of contentsregulation of the payment industry ha increased significantly in recent year complying with these and other regulation increase our cost and can reduce our revenue opportunity similarly the impact of such regulation on our client may reduce the volume of payment we process moreover such regulation can limit the type of product and service that we offer the country in which our card are used and the type of cardholder and merchant who can obtain or accept our card any of these occurrence can materially and adversely affect our business prospect for future growth financial condition and result of operation example include data protection and information security aspect of our operation and business are subject to privacy and data protection regulation in the united state and elsewhere our financial institution client in the united state are subject to similar requirement under the guideline issued by the federal banking agency in addition many state have enacted legislation requiring consumer notification in the event of security breach anti money laundering and anti terrorism financing the patriot act and similar law in other jurisdiction require to maintain an anti money laundering program sanction imposed by the treasury office of foreign asset control or ofac restrict from dealing with certain country and party considered to be connected with money laundering terrorism or narcotic non visa international member may not be similarly restricted so in some case third party could try to use our payment system for transaction in or involving country or party subject to ofac administered sanction we have control in place designed to ensure ofac compliance but if those control should fail we could be subject to penalty reputational damage and loss of business regulation of the price of credit many jurisdiction in which our card are used have regulation that could increase the cost of card issuance or decrease the flexibility of card issuer to charge market based interest rate and fee on credit card account these include the credit card act in the united state and proposed regulation under it they also include proposed change to the federal truth in lending act which if implemented along with regulation required to be promulgated under the credit card act could result in decrease in our payment volume and revenue increased central bank oversight several central bank around the world have increased or are seeking to increase their formal oversight of the retail electronic payment industry in some case designating them systemically important payment system such oversight may lead to additional regulation these could include new settlement procedure or other operational rule to address credit and operational risk they could also include new criterion for member participation and merchant access to our payment system safety and soundness regulation recent banking regulation enacted in the united state and elsewhere may make some financial institution le attracted to becoming an issuer of our card because they may be subject to increased risk management or higher capital requirement regulation of internet transaction proposed legislation in various jurisdiction may make it le desirable or more costly to complete internet transaction using our card by affecting the legality of those transaction the law that governs them their taxation or the allocation of intellectual property right money transfer regulation we expand our product offering we may become subject to state money transfer regulation increasing regulatory oversight and cost of compliance litigation risk our retrospective responsibility plan may not adequately insulate from the impact of settlement or final judgment our retrospective responsibility plan address monetary liability from settlement of or final judgment in the covered litigation which is described in note retrospective responsibility plan to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report the retrospective responsibility plan consists of several related mechanism to fund settlement or judgment in the covered litigation these include an escrow account funded with portion of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and potential subsequent offering of our share of class common stock or deposit of cash into the escrow account in lieu of such offering they also include loss sharing agreement and judgment sharing agreement in addition our member are obligated to indemnify pursuant to visa certificate of incorporation and bylaw and in accordance with their membership agreement these mechanism are unique complicated and tiered and if we can not use one or of contentsmore of them this could have material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flow or in certain circumstance even cause to become insolvent the principal remaining covered litigation involves interchange reimbursement fee since approximately class action and individual complaint have been filed on behalf of merchant against mastercard and or other defendant including certain financial institution that issue visa branded payment card and acquire visa branded payment transaction in the we refer to this the interchange litigation among other antitrust allegation the plaintiff have alleged that visa setting of default interchange rate violated federal and state antitrust law the lawsuit were transferred to multi district litigation in the district court for the eastern district of new york the plaintiff in the interchange litigation seek damage for alleged overcharge in merchant discount fee well injunctive and other relief the consolidated class action complaint alleges that the plaintiff estimate that damage will range in the ten of billion of dollar because these lawsuit were brought under the federal antitrust law any actual damage will be trebled the allocation of any monetary judgment or settlement among the defendant is governed by an omnibus agreement dated february see note retrospective responsibility plan and note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report the visa portion of settlement or judgment covered by the omnibus agreement would be allocated in accordance with specified provision of our retrospective responsibility plan the company litigation escrow account currently contains an amount that cover our exposure in the interchange litigation negotiated with the class plaintiff on october we signed settlement agreement in these case including an agreement to pay approximately billion to the class plaintiff the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement agreement with the class plaintiff on november however the agreement with the class plaintiff remains subject to final court approval and the adjudication of any appeal we can not assure that the court will provide final approval of the settlement or that we will win any appeal failure of our retrospective responsibility plan to insulate adequately from the impact of such settlement or judgment could result in material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flow such failure could even cause to become insolvent the retrospective responsibility plan address only the covered litigation the plan generally not cover other pending litigation or any litigation that we may face in the future except for case that include claim for damage relating to the period prior to our initial public offering that are transferred for pre trial proceeding or otherwise included in the interchange litigation see if we are found liable in other pending or future lawsuit we may have to pay substantial damage in addition non monetary settlement term and judgment in the covered litigation may require to modify the way we do business see limitation on our business resulting from litigation may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability therefore even if our retrospective responsibility plan provides with adequate funding to satisfy our obligation with respect to monetary liability from settlement of and judgment in the covered litigation it will not insulate from the monetary impact of all litigation if we are found liable in other pending or future lawsuit we may have to pay substantial damage like many other large company we are defendant in number of civil action and investigation alleging violation of competition antitrust law consumer protection law or intellectual property law among others example of such claim are described more fully in note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report some lawsuit involve complex claim that are subject to substantial uncertainty and unspecified damage therefore we can not ascertain the probability of loss or estimate the damage accordingly we have not established allowance for such legal proceeding private plaintiff often seek class action certification in case against this is particularly so in case involving merchant and consumer due to the size and scope of our business if we are found liable in large class action lawsuit such the united state or canadian merchant class action lawsuit monetary damage could be significant see note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report if we are unsuccessful in our defense against any material current or future legal proceeding we may have to pay substantial damage this could result in material and adverse effect on our result of operation cash flow and financial condition and could even cause to become insolvent of contentslimitations on our business resulting from litigation may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability certain limitation have been placed on our business in recent year because of litigation we may also have to change our business practice in response to pending or future litigation for example in the pending settlement agreement in the interchange litigation we have agreed among other thing to permit merchant to add surcharge to credit transaction under certain circumstance these and other settlement of or judgment in past pending and future litigation could force to limit further the fee we charge to revise further our rule about fee charged to consumer who choose to pay with visa or to make other modification to our business these modification could materially and adversely affect our payment volume revenue operating result prospect for future growth and overall business tax examination or dispute or change in the tax law applicable to could materially increase our tax payment we exercise significant judgment in calculating our worldwide provision for income tax and other tax liability although we believe our tax estimate are reasonable many factor may decrease their accuracy we are currently under examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authority and we may be subject to additional examination in the future the tax authority may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material item and thereby increase our tax liability failure to sustain our position in these matter could result in material and adverse effect on our cash flow and financial position in addition change in existing law such recent proposal for fundamental and international tax reform may also increase our effective tax rate substantial increase in our tax burden could have material adverse effect on our financial result see also note income tax to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report our agreement with visa europe includes indemnity obligation that could expose to significant liability under our framework agreement with visa europe we indemnify it for loss resulting from all claim outside it region arising from our or their activity and relating to our or their payment business this obligation applies even if neither we nor any of our related party or agent participated in the action giving rise to such claim such an obligation could expose to significant liability for activity over which we have little or no control our retrospective responsibility plan would not cover these liability business risk the intense pressure we face on client pricing may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profit we offer incentive to client in order to increase payment volume enter new market segment and expand our card base these include up front cash payment fee discount credit performance based incentive marketing support payment and other support over the past several year we have increased the use of incentive such up front cash payment and fee discount in many country including the united state in order to stay competitive we may have to continue to increase our use of incentive the economic pressure on our client arising from the dodd frank act have increased this pressure see the dodd frank act may continue to have material adverse impact on our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business this pressure may make the provision of certain product and service le profitable or unprofitable and may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profit pressure on client pricing also pose indirect risk presenting the potential for the same adverse effect if we continue to increase incentive to our client we will need to find way to offset the financial impact by increasing payment volume the amount of fee based service we provide or both we may not succeed in so particularly in the current regulatory environment in addition we benefit from long term contract with certain client including those that are large contributor to our revenue continued pressure on our fee could prevent from entering into such agreement in the future on favorable term we may also have to modify existing agreement in order to maintain relationship or comply with regulation finally increased pricing pressure enhances the importance of cost containment and productivity initiative in area other than those surrounding client incentive and we may not succeed in these effort intense competition in our industry may cause our business financial condition result of operation and of contentsprospects for future growth to suffer the global payment industry is intensely competitive our payment program compete against all form of payment these include cash check and electronic and mobile transaction in addition our payment program compete against the card based payment system of our competitor and private label card issued by merchant the dodd frank act ha increased this competitive pressure some of our competitor may develop substantially greater financial and other resource than we have they may offer wider range of program product and service than we do including more innovative one they may use advertising and marketing strategy that are more effective than ours achieving broader brand recognition and merchant acceptance than we do they may develop better security solution or more favorable pricing arrangement than we have certain of our competitor operate with different business model have different cost structure or participate selectively in different market segment these include domestic network in the united state china canada australia and other country and region they may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to new regulatory technological and other development in many case these competitor have the support of government mandate that prohibit limit or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for or otherwise secure transaction within those country and region traditional or untraditional competitor may put at competitive disadvantage by leveraging service or product in area in which we do not directly compete to win business in area where we do compete our client can reassess their commitment to at any time or develop their own competitive service the risk to maintaining or securing our client long term commitment to our product ha increased with the dodd frank act restriction on network exclusivity in the debit sector most of our larger client relationship are not exclusive these include those with our largest client jpmorgan chase and bank of america in certain circumstance our client may terminate these relationship sometimes on relatively short notice and in many case subject to significant early termination fee because significant portion of our operating revenue is concentrated among our largest client our operating revenue would decline significantly if we lost one or more of them this could have material adverse impact on our business financial condition and result of operation see note enterprise wide disclosure and concentration of business to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report we expect there to be change in the competitive landscape in the future for example competitor client and others may develop product that compete with or replace the value added service we provide to support our transaction processing party that process our transaction in certain country may try to eliminate our position in the payment value chain participant in the payment industry may merge form joint venture or enter into other business combination that strengthen their existing business proposition or create new competing payment service or competition may increase from alternative type of payment service such mobile payment service online payment service and service that permit direct debit of consumer checking account or ach payment our failure to compete effectively in light of any such development could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition revenue result of operation and prospect for future growth disintermediation from the payment value chain would harm our business our position in the payment value chain underpins our business certain of our competitor including american express discover private label card network and certain alternative payment system operate closed loop payment system with direct connection to both merchant and consumer and no intermediary these competitor seek to derive competitive advantage from this business model the dodd frank act and other regulatory action have provided and may in the future provide them with increased opportunity to do so in addition although they pursue the same or similar line of business using the same or similar business and commercial model they have not attracted the same level of legal or regulatory scrutiny of their pricing and business practice operator of multi party payment system such ours we also run the risk of disintermediation by virtue of increasing bilateral agreement between entity that would rather not use payment network for processing payment for example merchant could process of contentstransactions directly with issuer or processor could process transaction directly between issuer and acquirer additional consolidation in the banking industry could result in our losing business and create pressure on the fee we charge our client materially and adversely affecting our business revenue result of operation and prospect for future growth in the recent past the banking industry experienced substantial accelerated consolidation this could happen significant consolidation in the banking industry may result in the acquisition of one or more of our largest client by an institution with strong relationship with one of our competitor this could result in the acquired bank visa business shifting to that competitor resulting in substantial loss of business to in addition one or more of our client could merge with or acquire one of our competitor shifting it payment volume to that competitor additional consolidation in the banking industry could also reduce the overall number of our client and potential client and could increase the negotiating power of our remaining client and potential client this consolidation could lead financial institution to seek greater pricing discount or other incentive with in addition more consolidation could prompt our existing client to seek to renegotiate their pricing agreement with to obtain more favorable term we may also be adversely affected by price compression should one of our client absorb another financial institution and qualify for higher volume based discount on the combined volume of the merged business pressure on the fee we charge our client caused by such consolidation could materially and adversely affect our business revenue result of operation and prospect for future growth merchant continued focus on the cost associated with payment card acceptance may result in more litigation regulation regulatory enforcement and incentive arrangement we rely in part on merchant and their relationship with our client to maintain and expand the acceptance of our payment card consolidation in the retail industry is producing group of larger merchant that is significant impact on all participant in the global payment industry some merchant have sought to reduce their cost associated with payment card acceptance by lobbying for new legislation and regulatory enforcement and by bringing litigation if they continue these effort could materially and adversely affect our revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business we and our client negotiate pricing discount and other incentive arrangement with certain large merchant to increase acceptance and usage of our payment card if merchant continue to consolidate we and our client may have to increase the incentive provided to certain larger merchant this could materially and adversely affect our revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business competitive and regulatory pressure on pricing could make it difficult to offset the cost of these incentive certain financial institution have exclusive or nearly exclusive relationship with our competitor to issue payment card and these relationship may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenue certain financial institution have longstanding exclusive or nearly exclusive relationship with our competitor to issue payment card these relationship may make it difficult or cost prohibitive for to conduct material amount of business with them in order to increase our revenue in addition these financial institution may be more successful and may grow more quickly than our client which could put at competitive disadvantage failure to maintain relationship with our client merchant acquirer merchant and vendor and the failure of client to provide service on our behalf could materially and adversely affect our business we depend and will continue to depend significantly on relationship with our client and on their relationship with cardholder and merchant to support our program and service we do not issue card extend credit to cardholder or determine the interest rate if any or other fee charged to cardholder using card that carry our brand each issuer determines these and most other competitive card feature with the exception of several large merchant historically we have generally not solicited merchant directly to accept our card result the success of our business ha depended significantly on and will continue to depend on the continued success and competitiveness of our client and the strength of our relationship with them in the wake of the dodd frank act change to rule on network exclusivity we have engaged and expect to continue to engage in significantly more discussion with merchant and merchant acquirer and processor we of contentsalready engage in many co branding effort in which we contract with the merchant who directly receives incentive funding we also engage with merchant and merchant acquirer and processor to provide funding to promote routing and acceptance growth these and other relationship take on greater importance for both merchant and our success will increasingly depend on our ability to sustain and grow these relationship in many country outside the united state our client or other processor authorize clear and settle most domestic transaction using our payment card without involving our processing system this pattern is increasing with rise in new system endorsed by government in addition we historically have not generally had direct relationship with merchant there and shifting technology and development may further increase such activity we do not have direct relationship with cardholder consequently we depend on our close working relationship with our client to effectively manage the processing of transaction involving our card our inability to control the end to end processing for card carrying our brand in these country may put at competitive disadvantage by limiting our ability to ensure the quality of the service supporting our brand in addition we depend on third party to provide various service on our behalf and to the extent that third party vendor fail to deliver service our business and reputation could be impaired the perception of our company in the marketplace may affect our brand and reputation which are key asset of our business our brand and their attribute are key asset of our business the ability to attract and retain consumer cardholder and corporate client to visa branded product depends highly upon the external perception of our company and our industry our business may be affected by action taken by our client that change the perception of our brand from time to time our client may take action that we do not believe to be in the best interest of our brand such creditor practice that may be subject to challenge which may materially and adversely affect our business further visa europe ha broad latitude to operate the visa business in and use our brand and technology within visa europe region in which we have only limited control over the operation of the visa business visa europe is not required to spend any minimum amount of money promoting or building the visa brand in it region and the strength of the visa global brand depends in part on the effort of visa europe to maintain product and service recognition and quality in europe adverse development with respect to our industry may also by association impair our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny finally because we are domiciled in the united state negative perception of the united state arising from it political or other position could harm the perception of our company and our brand any of these factor could materially and adversely affect our revenue operating result prospect for future growth and overall business unprecedented economic event in financial market around the world have and are likely to continue to affect our client merchant and cardholder resulting in material and adverse impact on our prospect growth profitability revenue and overall business unprecedented economic event that began in continue to affect the financial market around the world these include decreased consumer spending increased unemployment deflation increased saving decreased consumer debt excess housing inventory lowered government spending decreased export activity continued challenge in the credit environment continued equity market volatility additional government intervention bank instability downgrade of sovereign bank and commercial debt political issue affecting the handling of national debt and the uncertainty arising from new government policy this economic turmoil ha affected the economy of europe the united state and other mature economy in particular the fragility of the current situation would be exacerbated if additional negative economic development were to arise these include default on government debt exhaustion of and other national economic stimulus package significant increase in oil price tax increase significant decline in the commercial real estate market and policy misstep most recently the economic situation in europe ha been particularly unstable arising from the real prospect of default by greece portugal spain and other nation on their debt obligation if such default occurs or if the measure taken to avert such default create their own instability economic turmoil is likely to result and the impact is likely to be global and highly significant in addition the so called fiscal cliff in the united state the combination of expiring tax cut and mandatory reduction in federal spending at the end of ha the potential to have an impact on the economy and the stock market the severity of the economic environment and the response by financial institution and government may create new risk or increase the impact of existing one these include the following depressed consumer and business confidence may continue to decrease cardholder spending of content uncertainty and volatility in the performance of our client business may reduce the accuracy of our estimate of our revenue rebate incentive and realization of prepaid asset our client may implement cost reduction initiative that reduce or eliminate payment card marketing or increase request for greater incentive or additional expense reduction which may reduce our revenue our client may decrease spending for optional or enhanced service affecting our revenue and reducing cardholder desire to use these product our client may increase cardholder fee cost recovery initiative or result of regulatory action decreasing our value proposition to consumer and reducing consumer desire to use our product government intervention or investment in our client may negatively affect our business with those institution or otherwise alter their strategic direction away from our product tightening of credit availability could affect the ability of participating financial institution to lend to under the term of our credit facility the trading market for government security may be adversely affected by change in investor sentiment this could arise from number of market force including among others the government inability to meet it obligation or possible further downgrade in it debt rating this in turn could adversely affect the liquidity of our investment substantial portion of which are treasury and government security our client may default on their settlement obligation including for reason unrelated to payment card activity such mortgage matter adverse fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate could negatively affect the dollar value of our revenue and payment in foreign currency the current economic environment could lead some client to curtail or postpone near term investment in growing their card portfolio limit credit line modify fee and loyalty program or take other action that adversely affect the growth of our volume and revenue stream from these client decline in stock price or significant instability could cause consumer spending to decline materially some existing client have been placed in receivership or under government administration many financial institution are facing increased regulatory and governmental influence including potential change in law and regulation many of our client merchant that accept our brand and cardholder who use our brand have been directly and adversely affected any of these development could have material adverse impact on our prospect growth revenue profitability and overall business decline in non and cross border activity and in multi currency transaction could adversely affect our revenue and profitability we generate significant portion of our revenue from such transaction we generate significant amount of our revenue from cross border transaction and our client pay fee in connection with them some of those fee differ when conversion from the merchant currency to the cardholder billing currency is required thus revenue from processing cross border transaction for our client fluctuates with cross border activity and the need for transaction to be converted into different currency in addition visa derives revenue from foreign currency exchange activity that result from our client settlement in different currency reduction in multi currency transaction may reduce the need for foreign currency exchange activity and adversely affect our revenue limitation or change in our ability to set foreign currency exchange rate for multi currency transaction result of regulation litigation competitive pressure or other reason may also adversely affect our revenue cross border travel may be adversely affected by world geopolitical economic and other condition these include the threat of terrorism natural disaster the effect of climate change and outbreak of disease decline in cross border travel could adversely affect our revenue and profitability decline in the need for conversion of currency might also adversely affect our revenue and profitability moreover if our client decide to increase cardholder fee associated with cross border transaction there could be decline in cardholder spending since our value proposition to the consumer could be reduced transaction outside the united state represent an increasingly important part of our strategy in order to continue to grow in those area we will need to ensure that we maintain consistency in the type of product we of contentsprovide the quality of our service and the viability of our brand if we can not employ our organizational resource effectively we will be unable to do so we risk loss or insolvency if our client fail to fund settlement obligation for which we have provided indemnification we indemnify issuer and acquirer for any settlement loss they suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to fund it daily settlement obligation in certain instance we may indemnify issuer or acquirer even in situation in which transaction is not processed by our system this indemnification creates settlement risk for due to the difference in timing between the date of payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement the term and amount of our indemnification obligation are unlimited but restricted to the amount of unsettled visa payment transaction at any point in time concurrent settlement failure involving more than one of our largest client or several of our smaller client may exceed our available financial resource could systemic operational failure lasting more than single day any such failure could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation in addition even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover settlement failure we may be unable to recover the amount of such payment this could expose to significant loss materially and adversely affecting our financial condition result of operation and cash flow we estimate settlement at risk or exposure based on the sum of three input the first is average daily volume during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of day to settle plus safety margin the second is four month of rolling average chargebacks volume the third is the total balance for outstanding traveler cheque additionally from time to time we review and revise our risk management methodology and input necessary see note settlement guarantee management to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report some of our client are composed of group of financial institution some of these client have elected to limit their responsibility for settlement loss arising from the failure of their constituent financial institution in exchange for managing their constituent financial institution in accordance with our credit risk policy to the extent that any settlement failure resulting from constituent financial institution exceeds the limit established by our credit risk policy we would have to absorb the cost of such settlement failure which could materially and adversely affect our cash flow if we can not keep pace with rapid technological development to provide new and innovative payment program and service the use of our product could decline reducing our revenue and net income rapid significant technological change continue to confront the payment industry these include development in smart card ecommerce mobile commerce and radio frequency and proximity payment device such contactless card we can not predict the effect of technological change on our business we rely in part on third party including some of our competitor and potential competitor for the development of and access to new technology we expect that new service and technology applicable to the payment industry will continue to emerge these new service and technology may be superior to or render obsolete the technology we currently use in our product and service in addition our ability to adopt new service and technology that we develop may be inhibited by industry wide standard by resistance to change from client or merchant or by third party intellectual property right our success will depend in part on our ability to develop new technology and adapt to technological change and evolving industry standard if our transaction processing system are disrupted or we can not process transaction efficiently the perception of our brand and our revenue or operating result could be materially and adversely affected our transaction processing system may experience service interruption or degradation because of processing or other technology malfunction fire natural disaster power loss disruption in long distance or local telecommunication access fraud terrorism climate change or accident in addition our visibility in the global payment industry may attract terrorist and hacker to conduct physical or computer based attack the latter could include computer virus worm or other destructive or disruptive software process breakdown denial of service attack malicious social engineering or other malicious activity or any combination of the foregoing any of these incident could result in degradation or disruption of our service or damage to our property equipment and data they could also compromise data security see account data breach involving card data stored by third party or by could adversely affect our reputation and of contentsrevenues if such attack are not detected immediately their effect could be compounded finally potential and actual attack could also result in increased cost both for recovery and for prevention against future attack additionally we rely on service provider for the timely transmission of information across our global data network if service provider fails to provide the communication capacity or service we require because of natural disaster operational disruption terrorism or any other reason the failure could interrupt our service because of the centrality of our processing system to our business any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of our brand reliability and materially reduce our revenue or profitability account data breach involving card data processed stored or transmitted by third party or by could adversely affect our reputation and revenue our client merchant others and we process store or transmit cardholder account information in connection with visa branded payment card in addition our client may use third party processor to process transaction generated by card carrying our brand breach of the system processing storing or transmitting sensitive cardholder data and account information could lead to fraudulent activity involving visa branded card to reputational damage and to claim against if we are sued in connection with any material data security breach we could be involved in protracted litigation if unsuccessful in defending such lawsuit we may have to pay damage or change our business practice or pricing structure any of which could have material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability in addition any reputational damage resulting from an account data breach at one or more of our client merchant or other third party could decrease the use and acceptance of our card which could have material adverse impact on our payment volume revenue and future growth prospect finally any data security breach could result in additional regulation which could materially increase our cost an increase in fraudulent or other illegal activity involving our card could lead to reputational damage to our brand and reduce the use and acceptance of our card criminal are using increasingly sophisticated method to capture cardholder account information they use the information to conduct fraudulent transaction and to engage in other form of illegal activity involving the payment system outsourcing and specialization of function within the payment system are increasing result more third party are involved in processing transaction using our card rise in fraud level and other illegal activity involving our card could lead to reputational damage to our brand this could reduce the use and acceptance of our card or lead to greater regulation increasing our compliance cost failure to maintain interoperability between our and visa europe authorization and clearing and settlement system could damage the business and global perception of the visa brand visa europe and we maintain mostly separate authorization clearing and settlement system result we have to ensure that the two system can process every transaction involving both of our territory regardless of where it originates visa europe independent system operation could present challenge to our business due to the heightened difficulty of maintaining the interoperability of our respective system failure to authorize or clear and settle inter territory transaction quickly and accurately could impair the global perception of the visa brand structural and organizational risk we have little ability to control visa europe operation and limited recourse if it breach it obligation to visa europe ha very broad right to operate the visa business in it region under the agreement that governs our relationship if we want to change global rule or to implement certain change that would not have positive return for visa europe and it member visa europe is not required to implement that rule or change unless we agree to pay for the implementation cost and expense that visa europe and it member will incur consequence of the implementation if visa europe fails to meet it obligation our remedy under this agreement are limited we can not terminate the agreement even upon visa europe material uncured breach although we have call right to acquire visa europe we can exercise that right under only extremely limited circumstance these and other feature of the license granted under the agreement may also raise issue concerning the characterization of the license for purpose of tax treatment of entry into the license and payment received thereunder in some instance in the case of cybersource and playspan visa europe may have the right to control of contentsthe activity of newly acquired entity within visa europe territory in any event visa europe license right in europe may hinder our ability to acquire new entity or to operate them effectively any inconsistency in the payment processing service and product that we can provide could negatively affect cardholder from visa europe using card in the country we serve or our cardholder using card in visa europe region if visa europe make acquire all of it outstanding stock we will incur substantial cost and may suffer material and adverse effect on our operation and net income we have granted visa europe put option requiring to purchase all outstanding capital stock from it member if exercised we will incur financial obligation of several billion dollar or more if visa europe exercise this option visa europe may do so at any time we may need to obtain third party financing in order to meet our obligation by either borrowing fund or selling stock an equity offering or the payment of part of the exercise price in our stock would dilute the ownership interest of our stockholder we would have only day to pay the exercise price sufficient financing might not be available to within that time on reasonable term see note visa europe to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report if visa europe exercise the put option we may encounter difficulty in integrating visa europe business and system into our existing operation if we can not do so quickly and cost effectively the integration could divert the time and attention of senior management disrupt our current operation and adversely affect our result of operation in addition we would become subject to the many regulation of the european union that govern the operation of visa europe including any regulatory dispute we are required to record quarterly any change in the fair value of the put option we record these adjustment through our consolidated statement of operation consequently the adjustment affect our reported net income and earnings per share these quarterly adjustment and their resulting impact on our reported statement of operation could be significant the existence of these change could adversely affect our ability to raise capital or the cost involved in raising it if we can not remain organizationally effective we will be unable to address the opportunity and challenge presented by our strategy and by the increasingly challenging competitive economic and regulatory environment since our reorganization in october we have increasingly centralized our management and operation for to succeed we must effectively integrate our operation actively work to ensure consistency throughout our organization and incorporate global perspective into our decision and process if we fail to do so we may be unable to expand rapidly we plan and the result of our expansion may be unsatisfactory in addition the current competitive economic and regulatory environment will require our organization to adapt rapidly and nimbly to new opportunity and challenge we may not be able to do so if we do not make important decision quickly enough define our appetite for risk specifically enough execute our strategy seamlessly enough implement new governance managerial and organizational process efficiently enough and communicate role and responsibility clearly enough we may be unable to attract and retain key management and other key employee our employee particularly our key management are vital to our success and difficult to replace we may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employee particularly if we do not offer employment term competitive with the rest of the market failure to attract and retain highly qualified employee or failure to develop and implement viable succession plan could result in inadequate depth of institutional knowledge or skill set adversely affecting our business acquisition strategic investment and entry into new business could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and result of operation although we may continue to make strategic acquisition or investment in complementary business product or technology we may be unable to successfully finance partner with or integrate them the integration of cybersource playspan and fundamo all acquired recently will take time and resource that would otherwise have been available for other acquisition we will be subject to the term of the exclusive license granted to visa europe in most acquisition and major investment that involve country in the visa europe territory regulatory of contentsconstraints particularly competition regulation may affect the extent to which we can maximize the value of acquisition or investment furthermore the integration of any acquisition or investment may divert management time and resource from our core business and disrupt our operation we may spend time and money on project that do not increase our revenue moreover our cash reserve contract to the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition or investment in cash although we periodically evaluate potential acquisition of and investment in business product and technology and anticipate continuing to make these evaluation we can not guarantee that we will be able to execute and integrate any such acquisition and investment with the evolution of technology and the opening of new market segment we may choose to participate in area in which we have not engaged in the past either through acquisition or through organic development these include electronic and mobile payment relative inexperience in such business requires additional resource and present an additional degree of risk which could materially and adversely affect our operation and result future sale of our class common stock or the end of transfer restriction on our class stock could result in dilution to holder of share of our existing class common stock adversely affecting their right and depressing the market price of our class common stock the market price and voting power of our class common stock could decline because of increase in the number of such share outstanding the market price of our class common stock may also suffer from the perception that such an increase could occur such upon the issuance or conversion of security convertible to share of our class common stock specifically upon the final resolution of our covered litigation all class stock will become transferable at if fund are released from escrow after the resolution of the litigation covered by our retrospective responsibility plan the value of our class common stock will be diluted under our retrospective responsibility plan fund still in the escrow account after the resolution of all covered litigation will be released back to at that time each share of class common stock will become convertible into an increased number of share of class common stock benefiting the holder of class common stock this in turn will result in dilution of the interest in visa inc held by the holder of class common stock in this case the amount of fund released and the market price of our class common stock will determine the extent of the dilution holder of our share of our class and common stock have voting right concerning certain significant corporate transaction and their interest in our business may be different from those of holder of our class common stock although their voting right are limited holder of share of our class and common stock can vote on certain significant

incentive to approve corporate action that may be favorable to the holder of class common stock and their interest may otherwise conflict with those of the holder of class common stock anti takeover provision in our governing document and delaware law could delay or prevent entirely takeover attempt or change in control provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation our bylaw and delaware law could delay or prevent merger or acquisition that our stockholder consider favorable for instance except for limited exception no person may beneficially own more than of our class common stock or of our total outstanding common stock on an converted basis unless our board of director approves the acquisition of such share in advance in addition except for common stock

overviewvisa is global payment technology company that connects consumer business financial institution and government around the world to fast secure and reliable electronic payment we provide our client with payment processing platform that encompass consumer credit debit prepaid and commercial payment we facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institution merchant consumer business and government entity each of these constituency ha played key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paper based to electronic form of payment and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunity particularly outside the united state we continue to explore additional opportunity to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment service we provide overall economic condition and regulatory environment our business is affected by overall economic condition and consumer spending our business performance during fiscal reflects the impact of modest global economic recovery the dodd frank act of october in accordance with the dodd frank act the federal reserve capped the maximum debit interchange reimbursement fee assessed for card issued by large financial institution at twenty one cent plus five basis point before applying an interim fraud adjustment up to an additional one cent this amounted to significant reduction from the average system wide interchange fee charged before the dodd frank act wa implemented the federal reserve ha also issued regulation requiring issuer to make at least two unaffiliated network available for processing debit transaction on each debit card the rule also prohibit and issuer from restricting merchant ability to direct the routing of electronic debit transaction over any of the network that an issuer ha enabled to process those transaction the interchange exclusivity and routing regulation have impacted our pricing reduced the number and volume of debit payment we process and decreased associated revenue number of our client have sought fee reduction or increased incentive from to offset their own lost revenue some have reduced the number of debit card they issue and reduced investment they make in marketing and reward program some have imposed new or higher fee on debit card or demand deposit account relationship some have elected to issue fewer card enabled with visa affiliated network additionally the routing regulation have allowed merchant to redirect transaction or steer cardholder to other network based on lowest cost or other factor we have had to examine and renegotiate certain of our client contract to ensure that their term comply with new regulation and will continue to do so with others result our client have sought and will continue to seek to renegotiate term relating to fee incentive and routing in some case we may lose placement completely on issuer debit card during the third quarter of fiscal we began implementation of our strategy to mitigate the negative impact from the dodd frank act to some extent by making pricing modification and working with our client and other business partner to win merchant preference to route transaction over our network for fiscal the overall net impact of the dodd frank act including restructured pricing incentive other mitigation strategy and volume loss wa decrease of approximately in diluted earnings per class common share our broad platform of payment product continues to provide substantial value to both merchant and consumer we believe that the continuing worldwide secular shift to electronic currency may help buffer the impact of the dodd frank act reflected in our overall payment volume growth particularly outside the united state leader in the debit industry we continue to develop and refine our competitive business model to adapt to the dodd frank act and mitigate some of it negative impact we remain committed and prepared to adapt to and compete effectively under this new debit regulatory environment notice of proposed adjustment on may the internal revenue service the irs issued notice of proposed adjustment nopa to our fiscal federal income tax return seeking to disallow the of contentsdeduction of settlement payment associated with the american express litigation made during that fiscal year

some extent through pricing modification and working with our client and other business partner to win merchant preference to route transaction over our network this price restructuring included the implementation of the fixed acquirer network fee which wa partially offset by reduction in certain variable fee while data processing fee benefited from the price restructuring that became effective in the third quarter of fiscal increased merchant and acquirer incentive executed part of this strategy resulted in higher client incentive level which partially offset this increase data processing revenue for fiscal also benefited from overall growth in processed transaction of which reflected an anticipated decline in debit transaction processed result of certain provision of the dodd frank act becoming effective the third quarter of fiscal the deceleration in processed transaction growth wa led by interlink one of our lowest yielding product in the which decreased in the second half of fiscal compared to the same prior year period this negative impact wa more than offset by solid growth in cybersource billable transaction visa transaction processed outside of the credit transaction and visa debit transaction which exclude interlink data processing revenue increased in fiscal primarily due to growth in processed transaction and inclusion of full year of revenue attributable to cybersource this growth wa partially offset by the effect of negotiated pricing from certain client contract and change to present revenue and offsetting expense associated with the processing of non

by the absence of depreciation and amortization on the incremental basis in asset recorded in our october reorganization these asset were fully depreciated of september see note acquisition to our consolidated financial statement general and administrative increased primarily due to travel activity in support of our international expansion combined with the absence of unrealized foreign

position wa payable of million although our greatest working capital requirement wa peak net settlement receivable balance of million covered litigation we are party to legal and regulatory proceeding with respect to variety of matter including certain litigation that we refer to the covered litigation noted above monetary liability from settlement of or judgment in the covered litigation are

price of the visa europe share which subject to certain adjustment applies visa inc forward price to earnings multiple or the ratio defined in the option agreement at the time the option is exercised to visa europe adjusted sustainable income for the forward month period or the adjusted sustainable income defined in the option agreement the calculation of visa europe adjusted sustainable income under the term of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustment for cost synergy and other negotiated item upon exercise the key input to this formula including visa europe adjusted sustainable income will be the result of negotiation between and visa europe the put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two party are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price at september we determined the fair value of the put option liability to be approximately million while this amount represents the fair value of the put option at september it doe not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised the purchase price we could be obligated to pay day after exercise will represent substantial financial obligation which could be several billion dollar or more we may need to obtain third party financing either by borrowing fund or undertaking subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment the amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on among other thing visa europe adjusted sustainable income and our ratio in each of contentscase negotiated at the time the put option is exercised given the perpetual nature of the put option and the various economic condition which could be present at the time of exercise our ultimate obligation in the event of exercise can not be reliably estimated the following table calculates our total obligation assuming for illustrative purpose only range of ratio for visa inc and assuming that visa europe demonstrates million of adjusted sustainable income at the date of exercise the million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below is for illustrative purpose only this doe not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income visa europe would have been able to demonstrate at september or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future should visa europe elect to exercise it option we believe it is likely that it will implement change in it business operation to move to for profit model in order to maximize it adjusted sustainable income and result to increase the purchase price the table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout assuming the same range of estimated ratio for each million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed million demonstrated at the time of exercise at september our estimated long term ratio wa and the long term differential the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to visa europe wa at september the spot ratio wa and the spot differential the difference between this ratio and the estimated spot ratio applicable to visa europe wa these ratio are for reference purpose only and are not necessarily indicative of the ratio or differential that could be applicable if the put option were exercised at any point in the future visa inc forwardprice to

funded on current basis we typically fund our qualified pension plan in september of each year funding doe not impact current period pension expense but ha the positive impact of reducing future period expense for the plan in fiscal and we made contribution to our pension and other postretirement plan of million million and million respectively in fiscal we anticipate funding our defined benefit pension plan and postretirement plan by approximately million the actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan movement in the discount rate

cash received see note acquisition to our consolidated financial statement we will continue to pursue our growth initiative and to expand our product offering through acquisition and strategic partnership in the future fair value measurement financial instrument the assessment of fair value of our financial instrument is based on fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable input and minimize the use of unobservable input when measuring fair of contentsvalue observable input are obtained from independent source and can be validated by third party whereas unobservable input reflect assumption regarding third party would use in pricing an asset or liability of september our financial instrument measured at fair value on recurring basis included approximately billion of asset and million of liability of these instrument million or le than had significant unobservable input with the visa europe put option liability constituting million of this amount at september debt instrument in this category included million of auction rate security see note fair value measurement and investment to our consolidated financial statement balance sheet arrangement our off balance sheet arrangement are primarily comprised of guarantee and indemnification visa ha no off balance sheet debt other than lease and purchase order commitment discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligation table indemnification we indemnify client for settlement loss suffered by failure of any other customer to honor visa card traveler cheque or other instrument processed in accordance with our operating regulation the amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled visa payment transaction at any point in time we maintain global credit settlement risk policy and procedure to manage settlement risk which may require client to post collateral if certain credit standard are not met see note summary of significant accounting policy and note settlement guarantee management to our consolidated financial statement in the ordinary course of business we enter into contractual arrangement with financial institution and other client under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain type of loss incurred relating to the service we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement contractual obligation our contractual commitment will have an impact on our future liquidity the contractual obligation identified in the table below include both on and off balance sheet transaction that represent material expected or contractually committed future obligation of september we believe that we will be able to fund these obligation through cash generated from our operation and available credit facility or the litigation escrow account payment due by period le year more year total in million purchase order incentive and sponsorship settlement payment represents agreement to purchase good and service that specify significant term including fixed or minimum quantity to be purchased and fixed minimum or variable price provision and the approximate timing of the

with select client under various program designed to build payment volume increase acceptance and win merchant preference to route transaction over our network these agreement which range in term from one to thirteen year can provide card issuance and or conversion support volume growth target and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirement payment under these agreement will generally be offset by revenue earned from higher corresponding payment and transaction volume these payment amount are estimate and will change based on customer performance amendment to existing contract or execution of new contract related amount disclosed in note commitment and contingency to our consolidated financial statement of contentsrepresent the associated expected

designed to help increase visa branded card and volume over the life of these contract visa is required to make payment in exchange for certain advertising and promotional right in connection with these contractual commitment visa ha an obligation to spend certain minimum amount for advertising and marketing promotion over the life of the contract for obligation where the individual year of spend are not specified in the contract we have estimated the timing of when these amount will be spent visa mastercard various financial institution defendant and the class plaintiff signed settlement agreement to resolve the class plaintiff claim in the interchange multidistrict litigation proceeding on october the amount in the table represents the maximum amount expected to be paid in fiscal under the class plaintiff settlement agreement and the individual plaintiff settlement agreement from the litigation escrow account this amount includes the million payment to the individual plaintiff settlement fund made in october litigation provision of billion for the covered litigation wa booked during fiscal see note retrospective responsibility plan and note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement includes expected dividend amount of million dividend were declared on october and will be paid on december to all holder of record of visa common stock of november we have liability for uncertain tax position of million at september we also accrued million of interest and million of penalty associated with our uncertain tax position we can not determine the range of cash payment that will be made and the timing of the cash settlement if any associated with our uncertain tax position therefore no amount related to these obligation have been included in the table visa granted perpetual put option to visa europe which if exercised will require to purchase all of the outstanding share of capital stock of visa europe from it member due to the perpetual nature of the instrument and the various economic condition which could exist when the put is exercised the ultimate amount and timing of visa obligation if any can not be reliably estimated therefore no amount related to this obligation have been included in the table however given the range of different economic environment and circumstance under which visa europe could exercise it option the ultimate purchase price could be several billion dollar or more the fair value of the visa europe put option itself totaling million at september ha also been excluded from this table it doe not represent the amount or an estimate of the amount of visa obligation in the event of exercise see liquidity and critical accounting estimate section of this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation and note visa europe to our consolidated financial statement we evaluate the need to make contribution to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan movement in the discount rate performance of the plan asset and related tax consequence expected contribution to our pension plan have not been included in the table such amount are dependent upon the consideration discussed above and may result in wide range of amount see note pension postretirement and other benefit to our consolidated financial statement critical accounting estimate our consolidated financial statement are prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state of america which requires to make judgment assumption and estimate that affect the amount reported see note summary of significant accounting policy to our consolidated financial statement we have established policy and control procedure which seek to ensure that estimate and assumption are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period however actual result could differ from our assumption and estimate and such difference could be material we believe that the following accounting estimate are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial result they require our most subjective or complex management judgment resulting from the need to make estimate about the effect of matter that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable revenue recognition client incentive critical estimate we enter into incentive agreement with select client and other business partner designed to build payment volume increase product acceptance and win merchant preference to route transaction over our network these incentive are primarily accounted for reduction to operating revenue however if separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established they are accounted for operating expense we generally capitalize advance incentive payment under these agreement if select criterion are met of contentsthe capitalization criterion include the existence of future economic benefit to visa the existence of legally enforceable recoverability clause such early termination clause management ability and intent to enforce the recoverability clause and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amount deferred capitalized amount are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit incentive not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management estimate of each client performance these accrual are regularly reviewed and estimate of performance are adjusted appropriate based on change in performance expectation actual client performance amendment to existing contract or the execution of new contractsassumptions and judgment estimation of client incentive relies on forecast of payment volume card issuance and card conversion performance is estimated using customer reported information transactional information accumulated from our system historical information and discussion with our client impact if actual result differ from assumption if our client actual performance or recoverable cash flow are not consistent with our estimate client incentive may be materially different than initially recorded increase in incentive payment are generally driven by increased payment and transaction volume which drive our net revenue result in the event incentive payment exceed estimate such payment are not expected to have material effect on our financial condition result of operation or cash flow the cumulative impact of revision in estimate is recorded in the period such revision become probable and estimable for the year ended september client incentive represented of gross operating revenue fair value visa europe put option critical estimate we have granted visa europe perpetual put option which if exercised will require to purchase all of the outstanding share of capital stock of visa europe from it member the put option provides formula for determining the purchase price of the visa europe share which subject to certain adjustment applies our forward price to earnings multiple or the ratio defined in the option agreement at the time the option is exercised to visa europe projected adjusted sustainable income for the forward month period or the adjusted sustainable income defined in the option agreement the calculation of visa europe adjusted sustainable income under the term of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustment for cost synergy and other negotiated item upon exercise the key input to this formula including visa europe adjusted sustainable income will be the result of negotiation between and visa europe the put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two party are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price see note visa europe to our consolidated financial statement for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the agreement the fair value of visa europe option wa estimated to be approximately million at september while the put option is in fact non transferable this amount recorded in our financial statement represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay third party market participant to transfer the potential obligation in an orderly transaction the fair value of the put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price under the term of the put agreement to the estimated fair value of visa europe the fair value of visa europe is defined the estimated amount third party market participant might pay in an arm length transaction under normal business condition probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that visa europe will never exercise it option while this amount represents the fair value of the put option at september it doe not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised which could be several billion dollar or more see the liquidity and capital resource section of management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation for further discussion assumption and judgment the most significant estimate used in the valuation of the put option are the assumed probability that visa europe will elect to exercise it option and the estimated differential between the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock defined in the put option agreement and that applicable to visa europe on stand alone basis at the time of exercise which we refer to the differential probability of exercise exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of visa europe on behalf of the visa europe shareholder pursuant to authority granted to visa europe under it article of association we estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including but not limited to of content visa europe stated intention ii indication that visa europe is preparing to exercise reflected in it reported financial result iii evaluation of market condition including the regulatory environment that could impact the potential future profitability of visa europe and iv qualitative factor applicable to visa europe largest member which could indicate change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holding differential the differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock defined in the put option agreement and that applicable to visa europe at the time of exercise for valuation purpose the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measure and qualitative factor quantitatively we estimate our ratio by dividing the average stock price over the preceding month the long term calculation and the last trading date the day calculation prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the month starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date this median earnings estimate is obtained from the institutional broker estimate system we then determine the best estimate of our long term price to earnings multiple for valuation purpose by qualitatively evaluating the day calculation compared to the long term calculation in this evaluation we examine both measure to determine whether difference if any are the result of fundamental change in our long term value or the result of short term market volatility or other non company specific market factor that may not be indicative of our long term forward we believe given the perpetual nature of the put option that market participant would more heavily weight long term value indicator opposed to short term indicator factor that might indicate fundamental change in long term value include but are not limited to change in the regulatory environment client portfolio long term growth rate or new product innovation consistent methodology is applied to group of comparable public company used to estimate the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to visa europe these estimate therefore are impacted by change in stock price and the financial market expectation of our future earnings and those of the comparable company other estimate of lesser significance include growth rate and foreign currency exchange rate applied in the calculation of visa europe adjusted sustainable income the valuation model assumes large range of annual growth rate reflecting the different economic environment and circumstance under which visa europe could decide to exercise the lowest growth rate assumed reflect visa europe current business model an association owned by it member bank while the highest reflect successful shift to for profit model in anticipation of exercise the scenario with higher growth rate are assigned significantly higher probability in the valuation model we believe market participant would more heavily weight these scenario it is likely that should it choose to exercise it option visa europe will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting for profit business model in advance of exercising the put option the foreign exchange rate used to translate visa europe result from euro to dollar reflects blend of forward exchange rate observed in the marketplace the assumed timing of exercise of the put option used in the various modeled scenario is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation obligation calculated in later year are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value impact if actual result differ from assumption in the determination of the fair value of the put option at september we have assumed probability of exercise by visa europe at some point in the future and an estimated long term differential at the time of exercise of approximately the use of probability of exercise that is higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in the value of the put option an increase of in the assumed differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in the value of the put option the put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of visa europe such the put option liability is included in accrued liability on our consolidated balance sheet at september classification in current liability is not an indication of management expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within month legal and regulatory matter critical estimate we are currently involved in various legal proceeding the outcome of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged period of time management is required to ass the probability of loss and amount of such loss if any in preparing our financial statement assumption and judgment we evaluate the likelihood of potential loss from legal or regulatory proceeding to which we are party we record liability for such claim when loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability of contentsand whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgment are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceeding the merit of our defense and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claim and may revise our estimate our retrospective responsibility plan only address monetary liability from settlement of or final judgment in the covered litigation the plan mechanism include the use of the litigation escrow account the accrual related to the covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance we recorded an additional accrual of billion for the covered litigation during fiscal see note retrospective responsibility plan and note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement impact if actual result differ from assumption due to the inherent uncertainty of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdiction in which we operate our judgment may be materially different than the actual outcome which could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation see note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement income tax critical estimate in calculating our effective tax rate we make judgment regarding certain tax position including the timing and amount of deduction and allocation of income among various tax jurisdiction assumption and judgment we have various tax filing position with regard to the timing and amount of deduction and credit the establishment of liability for uncertain tax position and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdiction we are also required to inventory evaluate and measure all uncertain tax position taken or to be taken on tax return and to record liability for the amount of such position that may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority impact if actual result differ from assumption although we believe that our estimate and judgment are reasonable actual result may differ from these estimate some or all of these judgment are subject to review by the taxing authority if one or more of the taxing authority were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded and we were unable to realize this benefit it could have material and adverse effect on our financial result and cash flow item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskmarket risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse change in market factor our exposure to financial market risk result primarily from fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate interest rate and equity price aggregate risk exposure are monitored on an ongoing basis foreign currency exchange rate riskalthough most of our activity are transacted in dollar we are exposed to adverse fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation are primarily related to adverse change in the dollar value of revenue generated from foreign currency denominated transaction and adverse change in the dollar value of payment in foreign currency primarily for expense at our non location we manage these risk by entering into foreign currency forward contract that hedge exposure of the variability in the dollar equivalent of anticipated non dollar denominated cash flow our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces but doe not entirely eliminate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movement the aggregate notional amount of our foreign currency forward contract outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program were million and million at september and respectively the aggregate notional amount of million outstanding at september is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below predetermined and approved threshold however actual result could materially differ from our forecast the effect of hypothetical change of the dollar is estimated to create an additional fair value gain or loss of approximately million on our foreign currency forward contract outstanding at september see note derivative financial instrument to our consolidated financial statement we are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activity this risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with client relative to the timing of market trade for balancing currency of contentspositions risk in settlement activity is limited through daily operating procedure including the utilization of visa settlement system and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties interest rate riskour investment portfolio asset are held in both fixed rate and adjustable rate security these asset are included in cash equivalent short term available for sale investment and long term available for sale investment investment in fixed rate instrument carry degree of interest rate risk the fair value of fixed rate security may be adversely impacted due to rise in interest rate additionally falling rate environment creates reinvestment risk because security mature the proceeds are reinvested at lower rate generating le interest income historically we have been able to hold investment until maturity our operating result or cash flow have not been and are not expected to be materially impacted by sudden change in market interest rate the fair value balance of our fixed rate investment security at september and were billion and billion respectively hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in interest rate would create an estimated change in fair value of approximately million on our fixed rate investment security at september the fair value balance of our adjustable rate debt security were million and million at september and respectively visa europe put optionwe have liability related to the put option with visa europe which is recorded at fair value at september we are required to record any change in the fair value of the put option on quarterly basis in the determination of the fair value of the put option at september we have assumed probability of exercise by visa europe at some point in the future and differential at the time of exercise of approximately the use of probability of exercise higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in the value of the put option an increase of in the assumed differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in the value of the put option see liquidity and capital resource and critical accounting estimate above pension plan riskour defined benefit pension plan asset were million and million and projected benefit obligation were million and million at september and respectively material adverse decline in the value of pension plan asset and or the discount rate for benefit obligation would result in decrease in the funded status of the plan an increase in pension cost and an increase in

the forward month period defined in the option agreement or the adjusted sustainable income the calculation of visa europe adjusted sustainable income under the term of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustment for cost synergy and other negotiated item upon exercise the key input to this formula including visa europe adjusted sustainable income will be the result of

the put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of visa europe such the put option liability is included in accrued liability on our consolidated balance sheet at september
