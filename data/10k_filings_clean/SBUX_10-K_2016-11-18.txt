product including due to price increase necessary to cover the cost of new product or higher input cost brand such the global expansion of teavana and platform such mobile technology or customer reducing their demand for our current offering new product are introduced the degree to which we enter into maintain develop and are able to negotiate appropriate term and condition of and enforce commercial and other agreement not successfully consummating favorable strategic transaction or integrating acquired business and the deterioration in our credit rating which could limit the availability of additional financing and increase the cost of obtaining financing to fund our initiative additionally our channel development business is also in part dependent on the level of support our retail business partner provide our product and in some market there are only retailer if our retail business partner do not provide sufficient level of support for our product which is at their discretion it could limit our ability to grow our channel development business also relatively small number of licensee partner own large number of licensed store if such licensee partner are not able to access sufficient fund or financing or are otherwise unable to successfully operate and grow their business including their licensed store it could adversely affect our result in the market in which they operate their licensed store effectively managing growth can be challenging particularly we continue to expand into new channel outside the retail store model increase our focus on our channel development and teavana business and expand into new market internationally where we must balance the need for flexibility and degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goal philosophy and standard growth can make it increasingly difficult to ensure consistent supply of high quality raw material to locate and hire sufficient number of key employee to maintain an effective system of internal control for globally dispersed enterprise and to train employee worldwide to deliver consistently high quality product and customer experience furthermore if we are not successful in implementing these strategic initiative we may be required to evaluate whether certain asset including goodwill and other intangible have become impaired in the event we record an impairment charge it could have material impact on our financial result we face intense competition in each of our channel and market which could lead to reduced profitability the specialty coffee market is intensely competitive including with respect to product quality innovation service convenience and price and we face significant and increasing competition in all these area in each of our channel and market accordingly we do not have leadership position in all channel and market in the the ongoing focus by large competitor in the quick service restaurant sector on selling high quality specialty coffee beverage could lead to decrease in customer traffic to starbucks store and or average value per transaction adversely affecting our sale and result of operation similarly continued competition from well established competitor in our international market could hinder growth and adversely affect our sale and result of operation in those market increased competition in the packaged coffee and tea and single serve and ready to drink coffee beverage market including from new and large entrant to this market could adversely affect the profitability of the channel development segment additionally decline in general consumer demand for specialty coffee product for any reason including due to consumer preference for other product could have negative effect on our business we are highly dependent on the financial performance of our america operating segment our financial performance is highly dependent on our america operating segment it comprised approximately of consolidated total net revenue in fiscal if the america operating segment revenue trend slow or decline especially in our and canada market our other segment may be unable to make up any significant shortfall and our business and financial result could be adversely affected and because the america segment is relatively mature and produce the large majority of our operating cash flow such slowdown or decline could result in reduced cash flow for funding the expansion of our international business and other initiative and for returning cash to shareholder of content we are increasingly dependent on the success of certain international market in order to achieve our growth target our future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of certain international market some or all of our international market business unit mbus which we generally define by the country in which they operate may not be successful in their operation or in achieving expected growth which ultimately requires achieving consistent stable net revenue and earnings the performance of these international operation may be adversely affected by economic downturn in one or more of the country in which our large mbus operate in particular both our china and japan mbus contribute meaningfully to both consolidated and cap net revenue and earnings decline in performance of one or more of our significant international mbus could have material adverse impact on our consolidated result additionally some factor that will be critical to the success of our international operation are different than those affecting our store and licensee taste naturally vary by region and consumer in some mbus may not embrace our product to the same extent consumer in the or other international market occupancy cost and store operating expense can be higher internationally than in the due to higher rent for prime store location or cost of compliance with country specific regulatory requirement because many of our international operation are in an early phase of development operating expense percentage of related revenue are often higher compared to more developed operation such in the additionally our international joint venture partner or licensee may face capital constraint or other factor that may limit the speed at which they are able to expand and develop in certain market our international operation are also subject to additional inherent risk of conducting business abroad such foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation or requirement to transact in specific currency change or uncertainty in economic legal regulatory social and political condition in our market interpretation and application of law and regulation restrictive action of foreign or governmental authority affecting trade and foreign investment especially during period of heightened tension the and such foreign governmental authority including protective measure such export and custom duty and tariff government intervention favoring local competitor and restriction on the level of foreign ownership import or other business licensing requirement the enforceability of intellectual property and contract right limitation on the repatriation of fund and foreign currency exchange restriction due to current or new and international regulation in developing economy the growth rate in the portion of the population achieving sufficient level of disposable income may not be fast we forecast difficulty in staffing developing and managing foreign operation and supply chain logistics including ensuring the consistency of product quality and service due to governmental action affecting supply chain logistics distance language and cultural difference well challenge in recruiting and retaining high quality employee in local market local law that make it more expensive and complex to negotiate with retain or terminate employee delay in store opening for reason beyond our control competition with locally relevant competitor or lack of desirable real estate location available for lease at reasonable rate any of which could keep from meeting annual store opening target and in turn negatively impact net revenue operating income and earnings per share and disruption in energy supply affecting our market moreover many of the foregoing risk are particularly acute in developing country which are important to our long term growth prospect increase in the cost of high quality arabica coffee bean or other commodity or decrease in the availability of high quality arabica coffee bean or other commodity could have an adverse impact on our business and financial result we purchase roast and sell high quality whole bean arabica coffee bean and related coffee product the price of coffee is subject to significant volatility and ha and may increase significantly due to one or more of the factor described below the high quality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on negotiated basis at premium above the price this premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly increase in the coffee commodity price do increase the price of high quality arabica coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixed price purchase commitment we frequently enter into supply contract whereby the quality quantity delivery period and other negotiated term are agreed upon but the date and therefore price at which the base coffee commodity price component will be fixed ha not yet been established these are known price to be fixed contract the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factor in the producing country including of contentsweather natural disaster crop disease general increase in farm input and cost of production inventory level and political and economic condition well the action of certain organization and association that have historically attempted to influence price of green coffee through agreement establishing export quota or by restricting coffee supply speculative trading in coffee commodity can also influence coffee price because of the significance of coffee bean to our operation combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practice and hedging activity increase in the cost of high quality arabica coffee bean could have an adverse impact on our profitability in addition if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantity of green coffee due to any of the above factor or to worldwide or regional shortage we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee which could have an adverse impact on our profitability we also purchase significant amount of dairy product particularly fluid milk to support the need of our company operated retail store additionally and although le significant to our operation than coffee or dairy other commodity including but not limited to tea and those related to food and beverage input such cocoa produce baking ingredient meat egg and energy well the processing of these input are important to our operation increase in the cost of dairy product and other commodity or lack of availability whether due to supply shortage delay or interruption in processing or otherwise especially in international market could have an adverse impact on our profitability our financial condition and result of operation are sensitive to and may be adversely affected by number of factor many of which are largely outside our control our operating result have been in the past and will continue to be subject to number of factor many of which are largely outside our control any one or more of

domestic and international market adverse outcome of litigation and especially in our larger or fast growing market labor discord war terrorism including incident targeting political instability boycott social unrest and natural disaster including health pandemic that lead to avoidance of public place or restriction on public gathering such in our store interruption of our supply chain could affect our ability to produce or deliver our product and could negatively impact our business and profitability any material interruption in our supply chain such material interruption of roasted coffee supply due to the casualty loss of any of our roasting plant interruption in service by our third party logistic service provider or common carrier that ship good within our distribution channel trade restriction such increased tariff or quota embargo or custom restriction or natural disaster that cause material disruption in our supply chain could negatively impact our business and our profitability additionally our food beverage and other product are sourced from wide variety of domestic and international business partner in our supply chain operation and in certain case are produced or sourced by our licensee directly we rely on these supplier and vendor to provide high quality product and to comply with applicable law our ability to find qualified supplier and vendor who meet our standard and supply product in timely and efficient manner is significant challenge especially with respect to good sourced from outside the especially country or region with diminished

condition and result and require the most difficult subjective or complex judgment often result of the need to make estimate about the effect of matter that are inherently uncertain judgment and uncertainty affecting the application of those policy may result in materially different amount being reported under different condition or using different assumption our significant accounting policy are discussed in note summary of significant accounting policy to the consolidated financial statement included in item of part ii of this we believe that of our significant accounting policy the following policy involve higher degree of judgment and or complexity we consider financial reporting and disclosure practice and accounting policy quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment during the past three fiscal year we have not made any material change to the accounting methodology used to ass the area discussed below unless noted otherwise of contentsproperty plant and equipment and other finite lived assetswe evaluate property plant and equipment and other finite lived asset for impairment when fact and circumstance indicate that the carrying value of such asset may not be recoverable when evaluating for impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset estimated future undiscounted cash flow if the estimated undiscounted future cash flow are le than the carrying value of the asset we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset carrying value exceeds it estimated fair value the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes it new cost basis and is depreciated over the asset remaining useful life long lived asset are grouped with other asset and liability at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flow are largely independent of the cash flow of other asset and liability for company operated store asset the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level the fair value of store asset is estimated using discounted cash flow model for other long lived asset fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant fact and circumstance which may include discounted cash flow comparable transaction or comparable company analysis our impairment calculation contain uncertainty because they require management to make assumption and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flow and asset fair value key assumption used in estimating future cash flow and asset fair value include projected revenue growth and operating expense well forecasting asset useful life and selecting an appropriate discount rate for company operated store estimate of revenue growth and operating expense are based on internal projection and consider the store historical performance the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store performance the discount rate is selected based on we believe buyer would assume when determining purchase price for the store these estimate are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flow and asset fair value is affected by factor such ongoing maintenance and improvement of the asset change in economic condition and change in operating performance during fiscal there were no significant change in any of our estimate or assumption that had material impact on the outcome of our impairment calculation however we periodically reassess estimated future cash flow and asset fair value change in our estimate and assumption may cause to realize material impairment charge in the future goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstance change that would indicate that impairment may exist when evaluating these asset for impairment we may first perform qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that reporting unit or intangible asset group is impaired if we do not perform qualitative assessment or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset group exceeds it carrying amount we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flow when assessing goodwill for impairment our decision to perform qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit in given year is influenced by number of factor inclusive of the size of the reporting unit goodwill the significance of the excess of the reporting unit estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessment and the date of acquisition if we perform quantitative assessment of an individual reporting unit goodwill our impairment calculation contain uncertainty because they require management to make assumption and to apply judgment when estimating future cash flow and asset fair value including projected revenue growth and operating expense related to existing business product innovation and new store concept well selecting an appropriate discount rate estimate of revenue growth and operating expense are based on internal projection considering the reporting unit past performance and forecasted growth strategic initiative local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit performance the discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for market participant to operate the reporting unit in the region these estimate are highly subjective and our ability to realize the future cash flow used in our fair value calculation is affected by factor such the success of strategic initiative change in economic condition change in our operating performance and change in our business strategy including retail initiative and international expansion when assessing indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment where we perform qualitative assessment we evaluate if change in event or circumstance have occurred that indicate that impairment may exist if we do not perform qualitative impairment assessment or if change in event and circumstance indicate that quantitative assessment should be performed management is required to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset group the fair value calculation includes estimate of revenue growth which are based on past performance and internal projection for the intangible asset group forecasted growth and royalty rate which are adjusted for our particular fact and circumstance the discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business these estimate are highly subjective and our ability to achieve the forecasted cash flow used in our fair value calculation is affected by factor such the success of of contentsstrategic initiative change in economic condition change in our operating performance and change in our business strategy including retail initiative and international expansion for fiscal we determined the fair value of our material reporting unit and intangible asset group were significantly in excess of their carrying value accordingly we not recognize any material impairment charge during the current fiscal year during fiscal there were no significant change in any of our estimate or assumption that had material impact on the outcome of our impairment calculation however we periodically reassess estimated future cash flow and asset fair value change in our estimate and assumption may cause to realize material impairment charge in the future income taxeswe recognize deferred tax asset and liability based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amount and the respective tax base of our asset and liability deferred tax asset and liability are measured using current enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which we expect the temporary difference to reverse we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax asset and may record valuation allowance if based on all available evidence we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized change in tax law and rate may affect recorded deferred tax asset and liability and our effective tax rate in the future however we do not expect change from recently enacted tax law to be material to the consolidated financial statement in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax asset within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversal of deferred tax liability projected future taxable income tax planning strategy and result of operation in projecting future taxable income we consider historical result and incorporate assumption about the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for item that do not have tax consequence our assumption regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plan and estimate we use to manage our underlying business in evaluating the objective evidence that historical result provide we consider three year of cumulative operating income loss in addition our income tax return are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authority these audit include review of our tax filing position including the timing and amount of deduction taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdiction we evaluate our exposure associated with our various tax filing position and recognize tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority including resolution of any related appeal or litigation process based on the technical merit of our position for uncertain tax position that do not meet this threshold we record related liability we adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled the statute of limitation expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available discussed in note income tax to the consolidated financial statement included in item of part ii of this there is reasonable possibility that our unrecognized tax benefit liability will be adjusted within month due to the expiration of statute of limitation and expected consent from taxing authority we have generated income in certain foreign jurisdiction that ha not been subject to income tax we intend to reinvest these earnings for the foreseeable future while we do not expect to repatriate cash to the to satisfy domestic liquidity need if these amount were distributed to the in the form of dividend or otherwise we would be subject to additional income tax which could be material determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability on these earnings is not practicable because such liability if any is dependent on circumstance existing if and when remittance occurs our income tax expense deferred tax asset and liability and liability for unrecognized tax benefit reflect management best assessment of estimated current and future tax to be paid deferred tax asset valuation allowance and our liability for unrecognized tax benefit require significant management judgment regarding applicable statute and their related interpretation the status of various income tax audit and our particular fact and circumstance although we believe that the judgment and estimate discussed herein are reasonable actual result could differ and we may be exposed to loss or gain that could be material to the extent we prevail in matter for which liability ha been established or

fund operation within one year are classified short term all other available for sale security are classified long term we evaluate our available for sale security for other than temporary impairment on quarterly basis unrealized loss are charged against net earnings when decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary we review several factor to determine whether loss is other than temporary such the length and extent of the fair value decline the financial condition and near term prospect of the issuer and whether we have the intent to sell or will more likely than not be required to sell before the security anticipated recovery which may be at maturity realized gain and loss are accounted for using the specific identification method purchase and sale are recorded on

not be required to sell before the investment anticipated recovery if decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary an impairment charge is recorded in net earnings fair valuefair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer liability exit price in an orderly transaction between market participant for asset and liability recorded or disclosed at fair value on recurring basis we determine fair value based on the following level the carrying value of cash and cash equivalent approximates fair value because of the short term nature of these instrument for trading and government treasury security and commodity future contract we use quoted price in active market for identical asset to determine fair value level when quoted price in active market for identical asset are not available we determine the fair value of our available for sale security and our over the counter forward contract collar and swap based upon factor such the quoted market price of similar asset or discounted cash flow model using readily observable market data which may include interest rate curve and forward and spot price for currency and commodity depending on the nature of the investment the fair value of our long term debt is estimated based on the quoted market price for the same or similar issue or on the current rate offered to for debt of the same remaining maturity level we determine the fair value of our auction rate security using an internally developed valuation model using input that include interest rate curve credit and liquidity spread and effective maturity of contentsassets and liability recognized or disclosed at fair value on nonrecurring basis include item such property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangible asset equity and cost method investment and other asset we determine the fair value of these item using level input described in the related section below derivative instrumentswe manage our exposure to various risk within our consolidated financial statement according to market price risk management policy under this policy we may engage in transaction involving various derivative instrument to hedge interest rate commodity price and foreign currency denominated revenue stream inventory purchase asset and liability and investment in certain foreign operation in order to manage our exposure to these risk we use various type of derivative instrument including forward contract commodity future contract collar and swap forward contract and commodity future contract are agreement to buy or sell quantity of currency or commodity at predetermined future date and at predetermined rate or price collar is strategy that us combination of purchased call option and sold put option with equal premium to hedge portion of anticipated cash flow or to limit the range of possible gain or loss on an underlying asset or liability to specific range swap agreement is contract between two party to exchange cash flow based on specified underlying notional amount asset and or index we do not enter into derivative instrument for speculative purpose we record all derivative on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value we generally do not offset derivative asset and liability in our consolidated balance sheet or enter into derivative instrument with maturity longer than three year however we are allowed to net settle transaction with respective counterparties for certain derivative contract inclusive of interest rate swap and foreign currency forward with single net amount payable by one party to the other we also enter into collateral security arrangement that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instrument fluctuates from contractually established threshold of october and september we posted and received million and million respectively of cash collateral related to the derivative instrument under collateral security arrangement of october and september the potential effect of netting arrangement with our derivative contract excluding the effect of collateral would be reduction to both derivative asset and liability of million and million respectively resulting in net derivative asset of million and net derivative liability of million of october and net derivative asset of million and net derivative liability of million of september by using these derivative instrument we expose to potential credit risk credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the term of the derivative contract we minimize this credit risk by entering into transaction with carefully selected credit worthy counterparties and distribute contract among several financial institution to reduce the concentration of credit risk cash flow hedgesfor derivative instrument that are designated and qualify cash flow hedge the effective portion of the derivative gain or loss is reported component of other comprehensive income oci and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci on our consolidated balance sheet the gain or loss is subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged exposure affect net earnings to the extent that the change in the fair value of the contract corresponds to the change in the value of the anticipated transaction using forward rate on monthly basis the hedge is considered effective and is recognized described above the remaining change in fair value of the contract represents the ineffective portion which is immediately recorded in interest income and other net on our consolidated statement of earnings cash flow hedge related to anticipated transaction are designated and documented at the inception of each hedge by matching the term of the contract to the underlying transaction cash flow from hedging transaction are classified in the same category the cash flow from the respective hedged item established cash flow hedge generally remain designated such until the hedge item impact net earnings or the anticipated transaction is no longer likely to occur for de designated cash flow hedge or for transaction that are no longer likely to occur the related accumulated derivative gain or loss are recognized in interest income and other net or interest expense on our consolidated statement of earnings based on the nature of the underlying transaction net investment hedgesfor derivative instrument that are designated and qualify net investment hedge the effective portion of the derivative gain or loss is reported

cost or market we record inventory reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory and for estimated shrinkage between physical inventory count inventory reserve are based on inventory obsolescence trend historical experience and application of the specific identification method of october and september inventory reserve were million and million respectively property plant and equipmentproperty plant and equipment which includes asset under capital lease are carried at cost le accumulated depreciation cost includes all direct cost necessary to acquire and prepare asset for use including internal labor and overhead in some case depreciation is computed using the straight line method over estimated useful life of the asset generally ranging from to year for equipment and to year for building leasehold improvement are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the related lease life generally year for lease with renewal period at our option we generally use the original lease term excluding renewal option period to determine estimated useful life if failure to exercise renewal option imposes an economic penalty to we may determine at the inception of the lease that renewal is reasonably assured and include the renewal option period in the determination of the appropriate estimated useful life the portion of depreciation expense related to production and distribution facility is included in cost of sale including occupancy cost on our consolidated statement of earnings the cost of repair and maintenance are expensed when incurred while expenditure for refurbishment and improvement that significantly add to the productive capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized when asset are disposed of whether through retirement or sale the net gain or loss is recognized in net earnings long lived asset to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value le estimated cost to sell we evaluate property plant and equipment for impairment when fact and circumstance indicate that the carrying value of such asset may not be recoverable when evaluating for impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset estimated future undiscounted cash flow if the estimated undiscounted future cash flow are le than the carrying value of the asset we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset carrying value exceeds it estimated fair value the fair value of the asset is estimated using discounted cash flow model based on forecasted future revenue and operating cost using internal projection property plant and equipment asset are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flow are largely independent of the cash flow of other asset and liability for company operated store asset the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level we recognized net disposition charge of million million and million and net impairment charge of million million and million in fiscal and respectively the nature of the underlying asset that is impaired or disposed of will determine the operating expense line on which the related impact is recorded on our consolidated of contentsstatements of earnings for asset within our retail operation net impairment and disposition charge are recorded in store operating expense for all other asset these charge are recorded in cost of sale including occupancy cost other operating expense or general and administrative expense goodwillwe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstance change such material deterioration in performance or significant number of store closure that would indicate that impairment may exist when evaluating goodwill for impairment we may first perform qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that reporting unit is impaired if we do not perform qualitative assessment or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds it carrying amount we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit fair value is the price willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is typically calculated using discounted cash flow model for certain reporting unit where deemed appropriate we may also utilize market approach for estimating fair value if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value part of our ongoing operation we may close certain store within reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease among other reason we may abandon certain asset associated with closed store including leasehold improvement and other non transferable asset when portion of reporting unit that constitutes business is to be disposed of goodwill associated with the business is included in the carrying amount of the business in determining any loss on disposal our evaluation of whether the portion of reporting unit being disposed of constitutes business occurs on the date of abandonment although an operating store meet the accounting definition of business prior to abandonment it doe not constitute business on the closure date because the remaining asset on that date do not constitute an integrated set of asset that are capable of being managed for the purpose of providing return to investor result when closing individual store we do not include goodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related asset noted above if store closure are indicative of potential impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level we perform an evaluation of our reporting unit goodwill when such closure occur there were no material goodwill impairment charge recorded during fiscal and other intangible assetsother intangible asset include finite lived intangible asset which mainly consist of acquired and reacquired right trade secret licensing agreement contract based patent and copyright these asset are amortized over their estimated useful life and are tested for impairment using similar methodology to our property plant and equipment described above indefinite lived intangible which consist primarily of trade name and trademark are tested for impairment annually during the third fiscal quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstance change that would indicate that impairment may exist when evaluating other intangible asset for impairment we may first perform qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an intangible asset group is impaired if we do not perform the qualitative assessment or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset group exceeds it carrying amount we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset group fair value is the price willing buyer would pay for the intangible asset group and is typically calculated using an income approach such relief from royalty model if the carrying amount of the intangible asset group exceeds the estimated fair value an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value in addition we continuously monitor and may revise our intangible asset useful life if and when fact and circumstance change there were no other intangible asset impairment charge recorded during fiscal and insurance reserveswe use combination of insurance and self insurance mechanism including wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in reinsurance treaty to provide for the potential liability for certain risk including worker compensation healthcare benefit general liability

trade receivables loan and held to maturity debt security the current probable loss recognition methodology is being replaced by an expected credit loss model for available for sale debt security the recognition model on credit loss is generally unchanged except the loss will be presented an adjustable allowance the guidance will be applied retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized of the date of adoption the guidance will become effective at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal but can be adopted early the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statement and the timing of adoption of contentsin march the fasb issued guidance related to stock based compensation which change the accounting and classification of excess tax benefit and minimum tax withholding on share based award the guidance becomes effective on prospective basis at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal but permit adoption in an earlier period we are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statement and the timing of adoption in march the fasb issued guidance for financial liability resulting from selling prepaid stored value product that are redeemable at third party merchant under the new guidance expected breakage amount associated with these product must be recognized proportionately in earnings redemption occurs our current accounting policy of applying the remote method to all of our stored value card including card redeemable at the third party licensed location will no longer be allowed the guidance will become effective at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal with the option to adopt in an earlier period the guidance and timing of transition are consistent with the new revenue recognition standard issued by the fasb in may and discussed below we expect to implement the provision of both set of guidance in the same period in february the fasb issued guidance on the recognition and measurement of lease under the new guidance lessee are required to recognize lease liability which represents the discounted obligation to make future minimum lease payment and corresponding right of use asset on the balance sheet for most lease the guidance retains the current accounting for lessor and doe not make significant change to the recognition measurement and presentation of expense and cash flow by lessee enhanced disclosure will also be required to give financial statement user the ability to ass the amount timing and uncertainty of cash flow arising from lease the guidance will require modified retrospective application at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal with optional practical expedient but permit adoption in an earlier period we are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statement we expect this adoption will result in material increase in the asset and liability on our consolidated balance sheet and will likely have an insignificant impact on our consolidated statement of earnings in january the fasb issued guidance on the recognition and measurement of financial instrument this guidance retains the current accounting for classifying and measuring investment in debt security and loan but requires equity investment to be measured at fair value with subsequent change recognized in net income except for those accounted for under the equity method or requiring consolidation the guidance also change the accounting for investment without readily determinable fair value and that do not qualify for the practical expedient to estimate fair value policy election can be made for these investment whereby estimated fair value may be measured at cost and adjusted in subsequent period for any impairment or change in observable price of identical or similar investment the new guidance will result in cumulative effect adjustment recognized in our balance sheet and will become effective for at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance in november the fasb issued guidance on the presentation of deferred income tax that requires deferred tax asset and liability along with related valuation allowance to be classified noncurrent on the balance sheet result each tax jurisdiction will now only have one net noncurrent deferred tax asset or liability the new guidance doe not change the existing requirement that prohibits offsetting deferred tax liability from one jurisdiction against deferred tax asset of another jurisdiction during the first quarter of fiscal we elected to early adopt this guidance retrospectively the following table summarizes the adjustment made to conform prior period classification to the new guidance in million september filed reclass adjustedcurrent deferred income tax asset long term deferred income tax deferred income tax liability included in accrued liability long term deferred income tax liability included in other long term liability deferred tax asset july the fasb issued guidance on the subsequent measurement of inventory which change the measurement from lower of cost or market to lower of cost or net realizable value the guidance will require prospective application at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have material impact on our financial statement in may the fasb issued guidance outlining single comprehensive model for entity to use in accounting for revenue arising from contract with customer that supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance this guidance requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfer promised good or service to customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those good or service the original effective date of the guidance would have required to adopt at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal however the fasb approved an optional one year deferral of the effective date the new guidance may be applied retrospectively to each prior period of contentspresented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized of the date of adoption we are currently evaluating the overall impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statement well the expected timing and method of adoption based on our preliminary assessment we determined the adoption will change the timing of recognition and classification of our stored value card breakage income which is currently recognized using the remote method and recorded in interest income and other net the new guidance will require application of the proportional method and classification within total net revenue on our consolidated statement of earnings additionally the new guidance requires enhanced disclosure including revenue recognition policy to identify performance obligation to customer and significant judgment in measurement and recognition we are continuing our assessment which may
