resulting decision regulation and legislation may have material adverse impact on our overall business and result of operation interchange fee are generally the largest component of the cost that acquirer charge merchant in connection with the acceptance of payment card they are also factor on which we compete with other payment provider and therefore an important determinant of the volume of transaction we process over our network we do not earn revenue from interchange fee we have historically set default interchange fee in the united state and certain other country in some jurisdiction interchange fee and related practice are subject to legislation regulation and litigation electronic form of payment have become more important to local economy regulator and legislative body in number of country well merchant are seeking to reduce these fee through legislation competition related regulatory proceeding central bank regulation and or litigation example of legislative activity related to interchange fee include in july the european commission proposed legislation relating to payment system regulation of card issued and acquired within the european economic area the eea the proposed legislation includes among other thing the of contentsfollowing element cap on credit and debit interchange fee of and basis point per transaction respectively initially for intra eea cross

regulated interchange rate the prohibition of rule that prevent an issuer from co badging that is putting competing brand on it credit or debit card and the separation of brand and processing in term of legal form organization and decision making procedurally the proposed legislation is currently being debated and may be potentially amended by the european union parliament the proposed legislation will also need to be reviewed by the council of minister and the european commission it can be adopted any final legislation if approved by the european union parliament and the council of minister could be different than what is in the initial proposal in poland and hungary legislation became effective in january capping domestic interchange fee and similar legislation is being considered in other jurisdiction such portugal and israel example of competition related regulatory proceeding or inquiry around the world with respect to interchange fee and acceptance practice include in december

kingdom passed legislation to create new regulatory body that would have the authority to regulate payment system and the government is in the process of determining the scope of this authority see note legal and regulatory proceeding to the consolidated financial statement included in part ii item for detailed description of regulatory proceeding and inquiry into interchange fee we believe that regulator are increasingly cooperating on interchange matter and result development in any one jurisdiction may influence regulator approach to interchange fee in other jurisdiction see our risk factor in risk factor legal and regulatory risk in this part item related to the impact of new regulation or other legislative or regulatory activity in one jurisdiction or of one product to other jurisdiction or other product additionally merchant are seeking to reduce interchange fee and impact acceptance rule through litigation such litigation includes in the united state merchant have filed approximately class action or individual suit alleging that our interchange fee and acceptance rule violate federal antitrust law these suit the settlement of which ha received final court approval alleged among other thing that our purported setting of interchange fee constitutes horizontal price fixing between and among mastercard and it customer bank and mastercard visa and their customer bank in violation of section of the sherman act which prohibits contract combination or conspiracy that unreasonably restrain trade the suit sought treble damage attorney fee and injunctive relief of content in canada number of class action suit have been filed against mastercard visa and number of large canadian bank relating to mastercard and visa interchange fee and rule related to interchange fee including honor all card and no surcharge rule in the united kingdom number of retailer have filed claim against for unspecified damage with respect to mastercard cross border interchange fee and it and ireland domestic interchange fee see note legal and regulatory proceeding to the consolidated financial statement included in part ii item for more detail regarding the allegation contained in these complaint and the status of these proceeding if issuer can not collect or we are forced to reduce interchange fee issuer will be unable to use interchange fee to recoup portion of the cost incurred for their service this could reduce the number of financial institution willing to participate in our four party payment system lower overall transaction volume and or make proprietary end to end network or other form of payment more attractive issuer could also choose to charge higher fee to consumer to attempt to recoup portion of the cost incurred for their service thereby making our card program le desirable to consumer and reducing our transaction volume and profitability in addition issuer could attempt to decrease the expense of their card and other payment program by seeking reduction in the fee that we charge to them this could also result in le innovation and fewer product offering we are devoting substantial management and financial resource to the defense of interchange fee in regulatory proceeding litigation and legislative activity the potential outcome of any legislative regulatory or litigation action could have more positive or negative impact on mastercard relative to it competitor if we are ultimately unsuccessful in our defense of interchange fee any such legislation regulation and or litigation may have material adverse impact on our overall business and result of operation in addition regulatory proceeding and litigation could result in mastercard being fined and or having to pay civil damage the dodd frank act may have material adverse impact on our overall business and result of operation the dodd frank act enacted in the united state includes provision that provide for the regulation by the federal reserve of debit and prepaid interchange fee and certain other network industry practice among other thing it requires debit and prepaid interchange transaction fee referred to in the dodd frank act fee established charged or received by payment card network for the purpose of compensating an issuer for it involvement in an electronic debit transaction to be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction additionally it provides that neither an issuer payment card network may establish exclusive network arrangement for debit or prepaid card or inhibit the ability of merchant to choose among different network for routing debit or prepaid transaction the federal reserve regulation implementing these provision limit per transaction debit and prepaid interchange fee to cent plus five basis point the issuer may receive fraud prevention adjustment of an additional one cent if it meet certain requirement the regulation contain exemption from the interchange limitation for issuer that together with their affiliate have le than billion in asset well for debit card issued pursuant to government administered payment program and certain reloadable prepaid card also while the regulation do not directly regulate network fee they make clear that network fee can not be used to circumvent the interchange fee restriction see our risk factor in risk factor legal and regulatory risk in this part item with respect to interchange fee and related practice receiving significant and increasingly intense legal regulatory and legislative scrutiny worldwide issuer and network are required to file various type of information regarding debit and prepaid transaction with the federal reserve periodically and such information could be used by the federal reserve to reexamine and potentially set the interchange cap with respect to network arrangement and transaction routing the regulation require debit and prepaid card to be enabled with two unaffiliated payment network the regulation also provide that an issuer or payment network may not inhibit the ability of any person that accepts or honor debit or prepaid card to direct the routing of the card transaction for processing over any network enabled on the card in july the district court for the district of columbia the district court granted summary judgment in favor of group of retailer and retailer trade association overturning these federal reserve regulation with regard to interchange fee and network non exclusivity the district court decision requires the federal reserve to revise it regulation to consider only incremental authorization clearing and settlement cost in determining the level of interchange fee well require two unaffiliated network for routing transaction for each authentication method pin and signature the federal reserve ha appealed the decision to the court of appeal for the district of columbia circuit the appellate court and the district court ha issued an order staying it decision pending this appeal result the federal reserve debit interchange regulation remain in effect the appellate process is completed the appellate court ha granted motion to expedite the federal reserve appeal and decision is expected in if the district court ruling is upheld the federal reserve would be required to revise it regulation in accordance with the ruling it is not clear at what level the federal reserve would set the interchange fee although based on the decision the level of interchange fee likely would be significantly reduced of contentsthe cfpb and fsoc were both created under the dodd frank act the cfpb ha significant authority to regulate consumer financial product although it is not clear whether and or to what extent it will regulate broader aspect of payment card network the fsoc is tasked with identifying payment clearing and settlement system that are systemically important if mastercard were designated systemically important it would be subject to new risk management regulation relating to it payment clearing and settlement activity new regulation could address area such risk management policy and procedure collateral requirement participant default policy and procedure the ability to complete timely clearing and settlement of financial transaction and capital and financial resource requirement also systemically important payment system could be required to obtain prior approval from the federal reserve or another federal agency for change to it system rule procedure or operation that could materially affect the level of risk presented by that payment system these development or action could increase the cost of operating our business and may make electronic payment transaction le attractive to card issuer well consumer this could result in reduction in our payment volume and revenue if issuer acquirer and or merchant modify their business operation or otherwise take action in response to this legislation the federal reserve regulation and or any revised rule that have the result of reducing the number of debit or prepaid transaction we process or the network fee we collect the dodd frank act could have material adverse impact on our overall business and result of operation in order to successfully compete in such an environment we and our customer would each need to adjust our strategy accordingly we entered into an agreement to settle the current merchant class litigation that among other thing requires to not restrict merchant subject to certain condition from surcharging credit card transaction which could impact the use of electronic payment and result in decrease in our overall transaction volume and could in turn materially and adversely impact our result of operation we have historically implemented policy referred to no surcharge rule in certain region including the united state that prohibit merchant from charging higher price to consumer who pay using mastercard product instead of other mean part of the term of the settlement of the merchant class litigation entered into by the company in october which ha received final court approval the company and visa have modified their no surcharge or comparable rule to permit merchant to surcharge credit card subject to certain limitation including ensuring that mastercard or visa cardholder are not unfairly subject to surcharging relative to cardholder of competing credit card network such american express discover and paypal should those network enforce rule that restrict surcharging it is possible that over time merchant in some or all merchant category may choose to surcharge permitted by the rule change which could make credit card program le desirable to consumer in the united state in the event that such merchant surcharge credit card this could result in consumer having le favorable view of our product and or using alternative mean of payment instead of electronic product which could result in decrease in our overall transaction volume and which in turn could materially and adversely impact our result of operation new regulation or other regulatory activity with respect to the payment industry in one jurisdiction or of one product may lead to new regulation or impact pending regulatory proceeding in other jurisdiction or of other product regulator around the world increasingly look at each other approach to the regulation of the payment and other industry consequently development in any one country state or region may influence regulatory approach in other country state or region for example the december european commission decision with respect to cross border interchange fee could also lead to additional competition authority in european member state commencing investigation or proceeding regarding domestic interchange fee or initiating regulation the general court judgment in may upholding the european commission decision ha increased the possibility of such action well the possibility of an adverse outcome for in related and pending matter similarly new law and regulation in country state or region involving one product may cause lawmaker there to extend the regulation to another product for example regulation affecting debit transaction such the federal reserve rule implementing the dodd frank act could lead to regulation of other consumer product including credit see our risk factor in risk factor legal and regulatory risk in this part item with respect to government action that may prevent from competing effectively against provider of domestic payment service in certain country result the risk created by any one new law or regulation are magnified by the potential they have to be replicated in other jurisdiction or involving other product affecting our business these include matter like interchange rate network standard and network exclusivity and routing agreement conversely if widely varying regulation come into existence worldwide we may have difficulty adjusting our product service fee and other important aspect of our business with the same effect either of these outcome could materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation of contentsgovernment action preferring or protecting provider of domestic payment service in certain country may prevent from competing effectively against those provider which could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenue government in some country such china russia ukraine and india could act or have acted to provide resource or preferential treatment or other protection to selected national payment and processing provider or may otherwise create or have created and support it own national provider this action may displace from prevent from entering into or substantially restrict from participating in particular geography an example government in some country are considering or may consider regulatory requirement that mandate processing of domestic payment either entirely in that country or by only domestic company such development would prevent from utilizing our global processing capability for customer our effort to effect change in or work with these country may not succeed this could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenue and extend our global brand the payment industry is the subject of increasing global regulatory focus which may materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation we are subject to regulation that affect the payment industry in the many country in which our card and other device are used in particular many of our customer are subject to regulation applicable to bank and other financial institution in the united state and abroad and consequently we are at time affected by such regulation regulation of the payment industry including regulation applicable to and our customer ha increased significantly in the last several year see business government regulation in part item for detailed description of such regulation and related legislation example include anti money laundering and economic sanction we are subject to aml law and regulation including the usa patriot act in the united state well the various economic sanction program administered by ofac including restriction on financial transaction with certain country and with person and entity included on the sdn list we have policy procedure and control designed to comply with applicable aml and ofac sanction requirement we take measure to prevent transaction that do not comply with ofac sanction including obligating our customer to screen cardholder and merchant against the sdn list however despite these measure it is possible that such transaction may be processed through our payment system activity such money laundering or terrorist financing involving our card could result in an enforcement action and our reputation may suffer due to our customer association with those country person or entity or the existence of any such transaction any enforcement action or reputational damage could reduce the use and acceptance of our product and or increase our cost and thereby have material adverse impact on our business retail payment system regulation authority of regulator in several country to regulate certain aspect of payment system under which mastercard operates could result in obligation or restriction with respect to the type of product that we may offer to consumer the country in which our card and other payment device may be used and the type of cardholder and merchant who can obtain or accept our card such obligation and restriction could be further increased more jurisdiction provide oversight of payment system moreover if this oversight is used to provide resource or preferential treatment or protection to selected domestic payment and processing provider it could displace from or prevent from entering into or substantially restrict from participating in particular geography see our risk factor in risk factor legal and regulatory risk in this part item with respect to government action which may prevent from competing effectively against provider of domestic payment service in certain country issuer practice legislation and regulation our financial institution customer are subject to numerous regulation applicable to issuer and more generally to bank and other financial institution which impact consequence existing or new regulation in these or other area may diminish the attractiveness of our product to our customer and thereby directly impact our business and transaction volume regulation of digital transaction the congress and some state continue to consider regulatory initiative relating to digital area including cyber security copyright trademark infringement and privacy congress may also consider additional legislation to legalize and regulate internet gambling if implemented any such regulation could impose additional compliance burden on and or our customer including requiring or our customer to monitor filter restrict or otherwise oversee various category of payment card transaction thereby increasing our cost or decreasing our transaction volume increased regulatory focus on such in connection with the matter discussed above may result in costly compliance burden and or may otherwise increase our cost which could materially and adversely impact our financial performance similarly increased regulatory focus on our customer may cause such customer to reduce the volume of transaction processed through our system which could reduce our revenue and materially and adversely impact our financial performance finally failure to of contentscomply with the law and regulation discussed above to which we are subject could result in fine sanction or other penalty which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation well have an impact on our reputation regulation in the area of consumer privacy data use and or security could decrease the number of payment card and device issued and could increase our cost we are subject to regulation related to privacy data protection and information security in the jurisdiction in which we do business these regulation could result in negative impact to our business due to recent account data compromise event at large based retailer well the disclosure of the monitoring activity by certain governmental agency there ha been heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny around the world regulation of privacy and data protection and information security may require change to our data practice in regard to the collection use disclosure or security of personal and sensitive information failure to comply with the these law and regulation could result in fine sanction or other penalty which could materially and adversely affect our result of operation and overall business well have an impact on our reputation any additional or change to regulation in these area well the manner in which such law could be interpreted or applied may also increase our cost to comply with such regulation and could impact aspect of our business such fraud monitoring and the development of information based product and solution in addition these regulation may increase the cost of our customer to issue payment product which may in turn decrease the number of our card and other payment device that they issue any of these change could materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation liability we may incur for any litigation that ha been or may be brought against could materially and adversely affect our result of operation we are defendant on number of civil litigation and regulatory proceeding and investigation including among others those alleging violation of competition and antitrust law see note legal and regulatory proceeding to the consolidated financial statement included in part ii item for more detail regarding the allegation contained in these complaint and the status of these proceeding in the event we are found liable in any of these material litigation or proceeding particularly in the event we may be found liable in large class action lawsuit or on the basis of an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damage or under which we were jointly and severally liable we could be subject to significant damage which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and result of operation limitation on our business resulting from litigation or litigation settlement may materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation certain limitation have been placed on our business in recent year of litigation and litigation settlement such change to our no surcharge rule in the united state any future limitation on our business resulting from litigation or litigation settlement could reduce the volume of business that we do with our customer which may materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation potential change in the tax law applicable to could materially increase our tax payment potential change in existing tax law such recent proposal for fundamental tax reform in the united state including the treatment of earnings of controlled foreign corporation may impact our effective tax rate and tax payment this could adversely impact our result of operation see also note income tax to the consolidated financial statement included in part ii item business risk substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payment industry may materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation the global payment industry is highly competitive our payment program compete against all form of payment including paper based transaction principally cash and check card based or other electronic payment program or system including credit charge debit prepaid private label and other type of general purpose and limited use program contactless mobile and web based payment platform and other electronic transaction such wire transfer and automated clearing house payment within the global general purpose payment industry we face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide from system such visa american express discover unionpay jcb and paypal among others in certain jurisdiction including the united state visa ha greater volume scale and market share than we do which may provide significant competitive advantage moreover some of our traditional competitor well alternative payment service provider may have substantially greater financial and other resource than we have may offer wider range of program and service than we offer or may use more effective advertising and marketing strategy to achieve broader brand recognition or merchant acceptance than we have of contentsour ability to compete may also be affected by the outcome of litigation competition related regulatory proceeding central bank activity and legislative activity certain of our competitor including american express discover private label card network and certain alternative payment system operate end to end payment system with direct connection to both merchant and consumer these competitor seek to derive competitive advantage from their business model for example operator of end to end payment system tend to have greater control over consumer and merchant customer service than operator of four party payment system such ours in which we must typically rely on our issuing and acquiring financial institution customer in addition even when they operate program that utilize four party system these competitor have generally not attracted the same level of regulatory or legislative scrutiny of their pricing and business practice have operator of four party payment system such ours if we continue to attract more regulatory scrutiny than these competitor because we operate four party system or we are regulated because of the system we operate in way in which our competitor are not we could lose business to these competitor see business competition in part item if we are not able to differentiate from our competitor drive value for our customer and or effectively align our resource with our goal and objective we may not be able to compete effectively against these threat our competitor may also more effectively introduce their own innovative program and service that adversely impact our growth our customer can also develop their own competitive service we also compete against new entrant that have developed alternative payment system commerce payment system and payment system for mobile device well physical store location number of these new entrant rely principally on the internet to support their service and may enjoy lower cost than we do which could put at competitive disadvantage our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threat could materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation potential future change in the competitive landscape including disintermediation from other participant in the payment value chain also could harm our business we expect that there may be future change in the competitive landscape including party that process our transaction in certain country may try to eliminate our position an intermediary in the payment process for example merchant could process transaction directly with issuer or processor could process transaction directly between issuer and acquirer large scale consolidation within processor could result in these processor developing bilateral agreement or in some case processing the entire transaction on their own network thereby disintermediating rapid and significant technological change could occur resulting in new and innovative payment program that could place at competitive disadvantage and that could reduce the use of mastercard product competitor customer government and other industry participant may develop product that compete with or replace value added service we currently provide to support our transaction processing which could if significant number of cardholder choose to use them replace our own processing service or could force to change our pricing or practice for these service participant in the payment industry may merge create joint venture or form other business combination that may strengthen their existing business service or create new payment service that compete with our service our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threat could materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation we face continued intense competitive pressure on the price we charge our customer which may materially and adversely affect our business and result of operation we generate revenue from the fee that we charge issuer and acquirer for providing transaction processing and other payment related service and from assessment on the dollar volume of activity on card and other device carrying our brand in order to increase transaction volume enter new market and expand our card base we seek to enter into business agreement with customer through which we offer incentive pricing discount and other support to customer that issue and promote our product in order to stay competitive we may have to increase the amount of these incentive and pricing discount over the past several year we have experienced continued pricing pressure the demand from our customer for better pricing arrangement and greater rebate and incentive moderate our growth we may not be able to continue our expansion strategy to process additional transaction volume or to provide additional service to our customer at level sufficient to compensate for such lower fee or increased cost in the future which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation in addition of contentsincreased pressure on price enhances the importance of cost containment and productivity initiative in area other than those relating to customer incentive we may not succeed in these effort in the future we may not be able to enter into agreement with our customer on term that we consider favorable and we may be required to modify existing agreement in order to maintain relationship and to compete with others in the industry some of our competitor are larger and have greater financial resource than we do and accordingly may be able to charge lower price to our customer in addition to the extent that we offer discount or incentive under such agreement we will need to further increase transaction volume or the amount of service provided thereunder in order to benefit incrementally from such agreement and to increase revenue and profit and we may not be successful in doing so particularly in the current regulatory environment our customer also may implement cost reduction initiative that reduce or eliminate payment product marketing or increase request for greater incentive or greater cost stability these factor could have material adverse impact on our overall business and result of operation continuing consolidation or other change in or affecting the banking industry could result in loss of business for and create pressure on the fee we charge our customer resulting in lower price and or more favorable term for our customer which may materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation the banking industry ha undergone substantial accelerated consolidation in the past consolidation have included customer with substantial mastercard portfolio being acquired by institution with strong relationship with competitor if significant consolidation were to continue in the banking industry it may result in the substantial loss of business for which could have material adverse impact on our business and prospect in addition one or more of our customer could seek to merge with or acquire one of our competitor and any such transaction could also have material adverse impact on our overall business consolidation in the banking industry whether result of an acquisition of substantial mastercard portfolio by an institution with strong relationship with competitor or the combination of two institution with which we have strong relationship would also produce smaller number of large customer which could increase the bargaining power of our customer this consolidation could lead to lower price and or more favorable term for our customer any such lower price and or more favorable term could materially and adversely affect our result of operation if we lose significant portion of business from one or more of our largest customer our revenue could fluctuate and decrease significantly in the longer term which could have material adverse long term impact on our business most of our customer relationship are not exclusive and in certain circumstance may be terminated by our customer our customer can reassess their commitment to at any time in the future and or develop their own competitive service accordingly our business agreement with these customer may not reduce the risk inherent in our business that customer may terminate their relationship with in favor of relationship with our competitor or for other reason or might not meet their contractual obligation to in addition significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customer loss of business from any of our large customer could have material adverse impact on our overall business and result of operation merchant continue to be focused on the cost of accepting electronic form of payment which may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceeding and may increase the cost of our incentive program which could materially and adversely affect our profitability merchant are an important constituency in our payment system we rely on both our relationship with them well their relationship with our issuer and acquirer customer to expand the acceptance of our card and payment device we also work with merchant to help them enable new sale channel create better purchase experience improve efficiency increase revenue and fight fraud in the retail industry there is set of larger merchant with increasingly global scope we believe that these merchant are having significant impact on all participant in the global payment industry including mastercard some large merchant have supported the legal regulatory and legislative challenge to interchange fee that mastercard ha been defending including the merchant litigation to which the company recently entered into settlement agreement which ha received final court approval see our risk factor in this part item with respect to interchange fee and related practice receiving significant and increasingly intense legal regulatory and legislative scrutiny worldwide also see our risk factor in risk factor legal and regulatory risk in this part item with respect to the dodd frank act the continued focus of merchant on the cost of accepting various form of payment may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceeding merchant are also able to negotiate incentive from and pricing concession from our issuer and acquirer customer condition to accepting our payment card and device merchant consolidate and become even larger we may have to increase of contentsthe amount of incentive that we provide to certain merchant which could materially and adversely affect our result of operation competitive and regulatory pressure on pricing could make it difficult to offset the cost of these incentive certain customer have exclusive or nearly exclusive relationship with our competitor to issue payment product and these relationship may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenue and may have material adverse impact on our business certain customer have exclusive or nearly exclusive relationship with our competitor to issue payment product and these relationship may make it difficult or cost prohibitive for to do significant amount of business with them to increase our revenue in addition these customer may be more successful and may grow faster than the customer that primarily issue our card which could put at competitive disadvantage furthermore we earn substantial revenue from customer with nearly exclusive relationship with our competitor such relationship could provide advantage to the customer to shift business from to the competitor with which they are principally aligned significant loss of our existing revenue or transaction volume from these customer could have material adverse impact on our business we depend significantly on our relationship with our issuer and acquirer to manage our payment system if we are unable to maintain those relationship or if our issuer and acquirer are unable to maintain their relationship with cardholder or merchant that accept our product for payment our business may be materially and adversely affected while we work directly with many stakeholder in the payment system including merchant and government we are and will continue to be significantly dependent on our relationship with our issuer and acquirer and their further relationship with cardholder and merchant to support our program and service we do not issue card or other payment device extend credit to cardholder or determine the interest rate or other fee charged to cardholder using our product each issuer determines these and most other competitive payment program feature in addition we do not establish the discount rate that merchant are charged for acceptance which is the responsibility of our acquiring customer result our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customer and the strength of our relationship with them in turn our customer success depends on variety of factor over which we have little or no influence if our customer become financially unstable we may lose revenue or we may be exposed to settlement risk see our risk factor in risk factor business risk in this part item with respect to we guarantee certain third party obligation for further discussion with the exception of the united state and select number of other jurisdiction most in country opposed to cross border transaction conducted using mastercard maestro and cirrus card are authorized cleared and settled by our customer or other processor because we do not provide domestic processing service in these country and do not described above have direct relationship with cardholder we depend on our close working relationship with our customer to effectively manage our brand and the perception of our payment system among consumer in these country we also rely on these customer to help manage our brand and perception among regulator and merchant in these country alongside our own relationship with them from time to time our customer may take action that we do not believe to be in the best interest of our payment system overall which may materially and adversely impact our business if our customer action cause significant negative perception of the global payment industry or our brand cardholder may reduce the usage of our program which could reduce our revenue and negatively impact our result of operation in addition our competitor may process greater percentage of domestic transaction in jurisdiction outside the united state than we do result our inability to control the end to end processing on card and other payment device carrying our brand in many market may put at competitive disadvantage by limiting our ability to maintain transaction integrity or introduce value added program and service that are dependent upon processing the underlying transaction we rely on the continuing expansion of merchant acceptance of our product and program although our business strategy is to invest in strengthening our brand and expanding our acceptance network there can be no guarantee that our effort in these area will continue to be successful if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows or revers our business could suffer the marketplace perception of our brand and reputation may materially and adversely affect our overall business our brand and their attribute are key asset of our business the ability to attract and retain cardholder to our branded product depends highly upon the external perception of and our industry our business may be affected by action taken by our customer that impact

operation in addition to access our product and service our customer and cardholder increasingly use personal smartphones tablet pc and other mobile device that may be beyond our control we routinely are subject to cyber threat and our technology system and network have been subject to cyber attack because of our position in the payment value chain we believe that we are likely to continue to be target of such threat and attack to date we have not experienced any material impact relating to cyber attack or other information security breach however if one or more of these event occurs it could lead to security breach of the network system or device that our customer use to access our product and service which could result in the unauthorized disclosure release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of confidential proprietary and other information including account data information or data security compromise such event could also cause service interruption malfunction or other failure in the physical infrastructure or operation system that support our business and customer such the lack of availability of our value added system well the operation of our customer or other third party any actual attack could lead to damage to our reputation with our customer and other party and the market additional cost to mastercard such repairing system adding new personnel or protection technology or compliance cost regulatory penalty financial loss to both and our customer and partner and the loss of customer and business opportunity if such attack are not detected immediately their effect could be compounded we maintain an information security program business continuity program and insurance coverage and our processing system incorporate multiple level of protection in order to address or otherwise mitigate these risk we also test our system to discover and address any potential vulnerability despite these mitigation effort there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risk and not suffer loss in the future our risk and exposure to these matter remain heightened because of among other thing the evolving nature of these threat the prominent size and scale of mastercard and our role in the global payment and technology industry our plan to continue to implement our digital and mobile channel strategy and develop additional remote connectivity solution to serve our customer and cardholder when and how they want to be served our global presence our extensive use of third party vendor and future joint venture and merger and acquisition opportunity result cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of our control process and practice designed to protect our system computer software data and network from attack damage or unauthorized access remain priority for cyber threat continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resource to continue to modify or enhance our protective measure or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerability any of the risk described above could materially adversely affect our overall business and result of operation if our transaction processing system and other service are disrupted or we are unable to process transaction or service our customer efficiently or at all our result of operation would be materially reduced our transaction processing system and other key service offering may experience interruption result of disaster including but not limited to technology malfunction fire weather event power outage telecommunication disruption terrorism workplace violence accident or other catastrophic event our visibility in the global payment industry may also put at greater risk of attack by terrorist activist or hacker who intend to disrupt our facility and or system disaster that occurs of contentsat or in the vicinity of our primary and or back facility in any global location could interrupt our service although we maintain business continuity program to analyze risk ass potential impact and develop effective response strategy we can not ensure that our business would be immune to these risk additionally we rely on third party service provider for the timely transmission of information across our global data network inadequate infrastructure in lesser developed market could also result in service disruption which could impact our ability to do business in those market if one of our service provider fails to provide the communication capacity or service we require result of natural disaster operational disruption terrorism hacking or any other reason the failure could interrupt our service because of the intrinsic importance of our processing system to our business any

generated by card carrying our brand and merchant may use third party to provide service related to card use breach of the system on which sensitive cardholder data and account information are processed transmitted or stored could lead to fraudulent activity involving card carrying our brand damage our reputation and lead to claim against well subject to regulatory action we routinely encounter account data compromise event some of which have been high profile involving merchant and third party payment processor that process store or transmit payment card data which affect million of mastercard visa discover american express and other type of cardholder these event typically involve external agent hacking the merchant or third party processor system and installing malware to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of those system further data security breach may subject to reputational damage and or lawsuit involving payment card carrying our brand while most of these lawsuit do not involve direct claim against we could face damage claim in various circumstance which if upheld could materially and adversely affect our result of operation damage to our reputation or that of our brand resulting from an account data breach of either our system or the system of our customer merchant and other third party could decrease the use and acceptance of our card and other payment device well the trend toward electronic payment which in turn could have material adverse impact on our transaction volume result of operation and prospect for future growth or increase our cost by leading to additional regulatory burden being imposed upon an increase in fraudulent activity using our card could lead to reputational damage to our brand and or regulatory intervention which could reduce the use and acceptance of our card and other payment device criminal are using increasingly sophisticated method to capture cardholder account information to engage in illegal activity such counterfeiting or other fraud outsourcing and specialization become commonplace in the payment industry there are more third party involved in processing transaction using our card in addition fraud is more likely to occur in transaction where the card is not present such commerce and mobile commerce transaction which are becoming increasingly prominent increased fraud level involving our card or misconduct or negligence by third party processing or otherwise servicing our card could lead to regulatory intervention such enhanced security requirement well damage to our reputation which could reduce the use and acceptance of our card or increase our compliance cost and thereby have material adverse impact on our business rapid technological development in our industry present both operational and legal challenge including potential intellectual property exposure which could impact our result of operation or limit our future growth the payment industry is subject to rapid and significant technological change including continuing development of technology in the area of smart card and device radio frequency and proximity payment device such contactless payment device electronic commerce and mobile commerce among others we can not predict the effect of technological change on our business we rely in part on third party including some of our competitor and potential competitor for the development of and access to new technology we expect that new service and technology applicable to the payment industry will continue to emerge and these new service and technology may be superior to or render obsolete the technology we currently use in our program and service in addition our ability to adopt new service and technology that we develop may be inhibited by need for industry wide standard and by resistance from customer or merchant to such change by the complexity of our system our ability to adopt these technology can also be inhibited by intellectual property right of third party we have received and we may in the future receive notice or inquiry from patent holder for example other operating company or non practicing entity suggesting that we may be infringing certain patent or that we need to license the use of their patent to avoid infringement such notice may among other thing threaten litigation against or our customer or demand significant license fee our future success will depend in part on our ability to develop or adapt to technological change and evolving industry standard of contentsfailure to keep pace with these technological development could lead to decline in the use of our product which could have material adverse impact on our result of operation adverse currency fluctuation and foreign exchange control could negatively impact our result of operation during approximately of our revenue wa generated from activity outside the united state this revenue and the related expense could be transacted in non functional currency or valued based on currency other than the functional currency of the entity generating the revenue resulting exchange gain and loss are included in our net income our risk management activity provide protection with respect to adverse change in the value of only limited number of currency and are based on estimate of exposure to these currency in addition some of the revenue we generate outside the united state is subject to unpredictable currency fluctuation including devaluation of currency where the value of other currency change relative to the dollar if the dollar strengthens compared to currency in which we generate revenue this revenue may be translated at materially lower amount than expected furthermore we may become subject to exchange control regulation that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our other revenue currency into dollar the occurrence of currency fluctuation or exchange control could have material adverse impact on our result of operation acquisition strategic investment or entry into new business could disrupt our business and harm our result of operation or reputation although we may continue to make strategic acquisition of or acquire interest in joint venture or other entity related to complementary business product or technology we may not be able to successfully partner with or integrate any such acquired business product or technology in addition the integration of any acquisition or investment including effort related to an acquisition of an interest in joint venture or other entity may divert management time and resource from our core business and disrupt our operation moreover we may spend time and money on acquisition or project that do not meet our expectation or increase our revenue to the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition in cash it would reduce our cash reserve available to for other us and to the extent the purchase price is paid with our stock it could be dilutive to our stockholder furthermore we may not be able to successfully finance the business following the acquisition result of cost of operation including any litigation risk which may be inherited from the acquisition any acquisition or entry into new business could subject to new regulation with which we would need to comply and we could be subject to liability or reputational harm to the extent we can not meet any such compliance requirement our expansion into new business could also result in unanticipated issue which may be difficult to manage although we periodically evaluate potential acquisition of business product and technology and anticipate continuing to make these evaluation we can not guarantee that we will be able to execute and integrate any
