market share by leveraging high level of customer satisfaction and productivity regulatory mattersour business are heavily regulated in of our market we deal with numerous government agency and entity including not limited to all of the branch of the military nasa the federal aviation administration faa and the department of homeland security similar government authority exist in our non market government contract the government and other government may terminate any of our government contract at their convenience well for default based on our failure to meet specified performance requirement if any of our government contract were to be terminated for convenience we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation cost if any of our government contract were to be terminated for default generally the of contentsgovernment would pay for the work that ha been accepted and could require to pay the difference the original contract price and the cost to re procure the contract item net of the work accepted from the original contract the government also hold liable for damage resulting from the default commercial aircraft in the our commercial aircraft product are required to comply with faa regulation governing production and quality system airworthiness and installation approval repair procedure and continuing operational safety outside the similar requirement exist for airworthiness installation and operational approval these requirement are generally administered by the national aviation authority of each country and in the case of europe coordinated by the european joint aviation authority environmental we are subject to various federal state local and non law and regulation relating to environmental protection including the discharge treatment storage disposal and remediation of hazardous substance and waste we continually ass our compliance status and management of environmental matter to ensure our operation are in compliance with all applicable environmental law and regulation investigation remediation and operation and maintenance cost associated with environmental compliance and management of site are normal recurring part of our operation these cost often are allowable cost under our contract with the government it is reasonably possible that cost incurred to ensure continued environmental compliance could have material impact on our result of operation financial condition or cash flow if additional work requirement or stringent clean up standard are imposed by regulator new area of soil air and groundwater contamination are discovered and or expansion of work scope are prompted by the result of investigation potentially responsible party prp ha joint and several liability under existing environmental law we have been designated prp by the environmental protection agency or state environmental agency we are potentially liable to the government or third party for the full cost of remediating contamination at our facility or former facility or at third party site if we were required to fully fund the remediation of site for which we were originally assigned partial share the statutory framework would allow to pursue right to contribution from other prps for additional information relating to environmental contingency see note to our consolidated financial statement non sale our non sale are subject to both and non governmental regulation and procurement policy and practice including regulation relating to import export control investment exchange control anti corruption and repatriation of earnings non sale are also subject to varying currency political and economic risk raw material part and subassemblieswe are highly dependent on the availability of essential material part and subassemblies from our supplier and subcontractor the most important raw material required for our aerospace product are aluminum sheet plate forging and extrusion titanium sheet plate forging and extrusion and composite including carbon and boron although alternative source generally exist for these raw material qualification of the source could take year or more many major component and product equipment item are procured or subcontracted on sole source basis with number of company supplierswe are dependent upon the ability of large number of and non supplier and subcontractor to meet performance specification quality standard and delivery schedule at our anticipated cost while we maintain an extensive qualification and performance surveillance system to control risk associated with such reliance on third party failure of supplier or subcontractor to meet commitment could adversely affect production schedule and program contract profitability thereby jeopardizing our ability of contentsto fulfill commitment to our customer we are also dependent on the availability of energy source such electricity at affordable price seasonalityno material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal executive officer of the registrantsee item director executive officer and corporate

of new information future event or otherwise except required by law item risk factorsan investment in our common stock or debt security involves risk and uncertainty and our actual result and future trend may differ materially from our past or projected future performance we urge investor to consider carefully the risk factor described below in evaluating the information contained in this report of contentsour commercial airplane and global service business depend heavily on commercial airline and are subject to unique risk market condition have significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft and related service the commercial aircraft market is predominantly driven by long term trend in airline passenger and cargo traffic the principal factor underlying long term traffic growth are sustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging market demand for our commercial aircraft is influenced by airline profitability availability of aircraft financing world trade policy government to government relation technological advance price and other competitive factor fuel price terrorism epidemic and environmental regulation traditionally the airline industry ha been cyclical and competitive and ha experienced significant profit swing and constant challenge to be more cost competitive in addition availability of financing to non customer depends in part on the export import bank of the united state fully operational significant deterioration in the global economic environment the airline industry generally or the financial stability of one or more of our major customer could result in fewer new order for aircraft or service or could cause customer to seek to postpone or cancel contractual order and or payment to which could result in lower revenue profitability and cash flow and reduction in our contractual backlog in addition our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery period of several year any of these macroeconomic industry or customer impact could unexpectedly affect delivery over long period we enter into firm fixed price aircraft sale contract with indexed price escalation clause which could subject to loss if we have cost overrun or if increase in our cost exceed the applicable escalation rate commercial aircraft sale contract are often entered into year the aircraft are delivered in order to help account for economic fluctuation between the contract date and delivery date aircraft pricing generally consists of fixed amount modified by price escalation formula derived from labor commodity and other price index our revenue estimate are based on current expectation with respect to these escalation formula but the actual escalation amount are outside of our control escalation factor can fluctuate significantly from period to period change in escalation amount can significantly impact revenue and operating margin in our commercial airplane business we derive significant portion of our revenue from limited number of commercial airline we can make no assurance that any customer will exercise purchase option fulfill existing purchase commitment or purchase additional product or service from in addition fleet decision airline consolidation or financial challenge involving any of our major commercial airline customer could significantly reduce our revenue and limit our opportunity to generate profit from those customer our commercial airplane business depends on our ability to maintain healthy production system achieve planned production rate target successfully develop new aircraft or new derivative aircraft and meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standard the commercial aircraft business is extremely complex involving extensive coordination and integration with and non supplier highly skilled labor from thousand of employee and other partner and stringent regulatory requirement and performance and reliability standard in addition the introduction of new aircraft program and or derivative such the and involves increased risk associated with meeting development testing production and certification schedule result our ability to deliver aircraft on time satisfy regulatory and customer requirement and achieve or maintain applicable program profitability is subject to significant risk we must minimize disruption caused by production change and achieve productivity improvement in order to meet customer demand and maintain our profitability we have plan to adjust production rate on several of our commercial aircraft program while at the same time engaging in significant ongoing development and production of the and aircraft in addition we continue to seek opportunity to reduce the cost of building our aircraft including working with our supplier to reduce supplier cost of contentsidentifying and implementing productivity improvement and optimizing we manage inventory if production rate change at any of our commercial aircraft assembly facility are delayed or create significant disruption to our production system or if our supplier can not timely deliver component to at the cost and rate necessary to achieve our target we may be unable to meet delivery schedule and or the financial performance of one or more of our program may suffer operational challenge impacting the production system for one or more of our commercial aircraft program could result in production delay and or failure to meet customer demand for new aircraft either of which would negatively impact our revenue and operating margin our commercial aircraft production system is extremely complex operational issue including delay or defect in supplier component failure to meet internal performance plan or delay or failure to achieve required regulatory certification could result in significant of sequence work and increased production cost well delayed delivery to customer impact to aircraft performance and or increased warranty or fleet support cost if our commercial airplane fail to satisfy performance and reliability requirement we could face additional cost and or lower revenue developing and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and reliability standard well those of customer and regulatory agency can be costly and technologically challenging these challenge are particularly significant with newer aircraft program any failure of any boeing aircraft to satisfy performance or reliability requirement could result in disruption to our operation higher cost and or lower revenue change in level of government defense spending or overall acquisition priority could negatively impact our financial position and result of operation we derive substantial portion of our revenue from the government primarily from defense related program with the united state department of defense dod level of defense spending are very difficult to predict and may be impacted by numerous factor such the political environment foreign policy macroeconomic condition and the ability of the government to enact relevant legislation such authorization and appropriation bill in addition significant budgetary delay and constraint have already resulted in reduced spending level and additional reduction may be forthcoming the budget control act of the act established limit on government discretionary spending including reduction of defense spending between the and government fiscal year accordingly long term uncertainty remains with respect to overall level of defense spending and it is likely that government discretionary spending level will continue to be subject to pressure in addition there continues to be significant uncertainty with respect to program level appropriation for the dod and other government agency including nasa within the overall budgetary framework described while the house and senate appropriation committee included funding for boeing major program such ch chinook ah apache kc tanker and program in the final appropriation and in their bill uncertainty remains about how defense budget in and beyond will affect boeing program future budget cut including cut mandated by sequestration or future procurement decision associated with the authorization and appropriation process could result in reduction cancellation and or delay of existing contract or program any of these impact could have material effect on the result of the company operation financial position and or cash flow in addition result of the significant ongoing uncertainty with respect to both defense spending level and the nature of the threat environment we expect the dod to continue to emphasize cost cutting and other efficiency initiative in it procurement process if we can no longer adjust successfully to these changing acquisition priority and or fail to meet affordability target set by the dod customer our revenue and market share would be further impacted of contentswe conduct significant portion of our business pursuant to government contract which are subject to unique risk in of our revenue were earned pursuant to government contract which include foreign military sale fm through the government business conducted pursuant to such contract is subject to extensive procurement regulation and other unique risk our sale to the government are subject to extensive procurement regulation and change to those regulation could increase our cost new procurement regulation or change to existing requirement could increase our compliance cost or otherwise have material impact on the operating margin of our bd and bgs business these requirement may result in increased compliance cost and we could be subject to additional cost in the form of withheld payment and or reduced future business if we fail to comply with these requirement in the future compliance cost attributable to current and potential future procurement regulation such these could negatively impact our financial condition and operating result the government may modify curtail or terminate one or more of our contract the government contracting party may modify curtail or terminate it contract and subcontract with without prior notice and either at it convenience or for default based on performance in addition funding pursuant to our government contract may be reduced or withheld part of the congressional appropriation process due to fiscal constraint change in national security strategy and or priority or other reason further uncertainty with respect to ongoing program could also result in the event that the government finance it operation through temporary funding measure such continuing resolution rather full year appropriation any loss or anticipated loss or reduction of expected funding and or modification curtailment or termination of one or more large program could have material adverse effect on our earnings cash flow and or financial position we are subject to government inquiry and investigation including periodic audit of cost that we determine are reimbursable under government contract government agency including the defense contract audit agency and the defense contract management agency routinely audit government contractor these agency review our performance under contract cost structure and compliance with applicable law regulation and standard well the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control system and policy any cost found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to specific contract will be deemed non reimbursable and to the extent already reimbursed must be refunded any inadequacy in our system and policy could result in withholds on billed receivables penalty and reduced future business furthermore if any audit inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activity we could be subject to civil and criminal penalty and administrative sanction including termination of contract forfeiture of profit suspension of payment fine and suspension or debarment from business with the government we also could suffer reputational harm if allegation of impropriety were made even if such allegation are later determined to be false we enter into fixed price contract which could subject to loss if we have cost overrun our bd and bgs defense business generated approximately and of their revenue from fixed price contract while fixed price contract enable to benefit from performance improvement cost reduction and efficiency they also subject to the risk of reduced margin or incurring loss if we are unable to achieve estimated cost and revenue if our estimated cost exceed our estimated price we recognize reach forward loss which can significantly affect our reported result for example during we recorded reach forward loss totaling million on the usaf kc tanker contract primarily driven by additional cost attributable to certification and incorporating change into low rate initial production lrip aircraft the long term nature of many of our contract make the process of estimating cost and revenue on fixed price contract inherently risky fixed price contract often contain price incentive and penalty tied to performance which can be difficult to estimate and have significant of contentsimpacts on margin in addition of our contract have specific provision relating to cost schedule and performance fixed price development contract are generally subject to more uncertainty than fixed price production contract many of these development program have highly complex design in addition technical or quality issue that arise during development could lead to schedule delay and higher cost to complete which could result in material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition example of significant bd fixed price development contract include commercial crew saudi usaf kc tanker and commercial and military satellite we enter into cost type contract which also carry risk our bd and bgs defense business generated approximately and of their revenue from cost type contracting arrangement some of these are development program that have complex design and technical challenge these cost type program typically have award or incentive fee that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended period in these case the associated financial risk are primarily in reduced fee lower profit rate or program cancellation if cost schedule or technical performance issue arise program whose contract are primarily cost type include gmd proprietary and sl program we enter into contract that include in orbit incentive payment that subject to risk contract in the commercial satellite industry and certain government satellite contract include in orbit incentive payment these in orbit payment may be paid over time after final satellite acceptance or paid in full prior to final satellite acceptance in both case the in orbit incentive payment is at risk if the satellite doe not perform to specification for up to year after acceptance the net present value of in orbit incentive fee we ultimately expect to realize is recognized revenue in the construction period if the satellite fails to meet contractual performance criterion customer will not be obligated to continue making in orbit payment and or we may be required to provide refund to the customer and incur significant charge our ability to deliver product and service that satisfy customer requirement is heavily dependent on the performance and financial stability of our subcontractor and supplier well on the availability of raw material and other component we rely on other company including and non subcontractor and supplier to provide and produce raw material integrated component and sub assembly and production commodity and to perform some of the service that we provide to our customer if one or more of our supplier or subcontractor experience financial difficulty delivery delay or other performance problem we may be unable to meet commitment to our customer or incur additional cost in addition if one or more of the raw material on which we depend such aluminum titanium or composite becomes unavailable or is available only at very high price we may be unable to deliver one or more of our product in timely fashion or at budgeted cost in some instance we depend upon single source of supply any service disruption from one of these supplier either due to circumstance beyond the supplier control such geo political development or result of performance problem or financial difficulty could have material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitment to our customer or increase our operating cost we use estimate in accounting for many contract and program change in our estimate could adversely affect our future financial result contract and program accounting require judgment relative to assessing risk estimating revenue and of contentscosts and making assumption for schedule and technical issue due to the size and nature of many of our contract and program the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variable assumption have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract or program because cost also include expected increase in wage and employee benefit material price and allocated fixed cost incentive or penalty related to performance on contract are considered in estimating sale and profit rate and are recorded when there is sufficient information for to ass anticipated performance supplier assertion are also assessed and considered in estimating cost and profit rate estimate of award fee are also used in sale and profit rate based on actual and anticipated award with respect to each of our commercial aircraft program inventoriable production cost including overhead program tooling and other non recurring cost and routine warranty cost are accumulated and charged cost of sale by program instead of by individual unit or contract program consists of the estimated number of unit accounting quantity of product to be produced in continuing long term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contract limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimate to establish the relationship of sale to cost of sale program accounting requires estimate of the number of unit to be produced and sold in program the period over which the unit can reasonably be expected to be produced and the unit expected sale price production cost program tooling and other non recurring cost and routine warranty cost for the total program several factor determine accounting quantity including firm order letter of intent from prospective customer and market study change to customer or model mix production cost and rate learning curve change to price escalation index cost of derivative aircraft supplier performance customer and supplier negotiation settlement supplier claim and or certification issue can impact these estimate any such change in estimate relating to program accounting may adversely affect future financial performance because of the significance of the judgment and estimation process described above materially different sale and profit amount could be recorded if we used different assumption or if the underlying circumstance were to change change in underlying assumption circumstance or estimate may adversely affect future period financial performance for additional information on our accounting policy for recognizing sale and profit see our discussion under management discussion and analysis critical accounting policy contract accounting program accounting on page and note to our consolidated financial statement on page of this form competition within our market and with respect to the product we sell may reduce our future contract and sale the market in which we operate are highly competitive and one or more of our competitor may have more extensive or more specialized engineering manufacturing and marketing capability than we do in some area in our commercial airplane business we anticipate increasing competition among non aircraft manufacturer of commercial jet aircraft in our bd business we anticipate that the effect of defense industry consolidation fewer large and new program and new priority including near and long term cost competitiveness of our dod and non will intensify competition for many of our bd product our bgs segment face competition from many of the same strong and non competitor facing bca and bd furthermore we are facing increased international competition and cross border consolidation of competition there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitor or that the competitive pressure we face will not result in reduced revenue and market share of contentswe derive significant portion of our revenue from non sale and are subject to the risk of doing business in other country in non customer which includes fm accounted for approximately of our revenue we expect that non sale will continue to account for significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future result we are subject to risk of doing business internationally including change in regulatory requirement and non government policy including requirement to expend portion of program fund locally and governmental industrial cooperation or participation requirement fluctuation in international currency exchange rate volatility in international political and economic environment and change in non national priority and budget which can lead to delay or fluctuation in order the complexity and necessity of using non representative and consultant the uncertainty of the ability of non customer to finance purchase including the availability of financing from the export import bank of the united state uncertainty and restriction concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantee imposition of domestic and international tax export control tariff embargo sanction and other trade restriction the difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise spread over many country compliance with variety of non law well law affecting the activity of company abroad and unforeseen development and condition including terrorism war epidemic and international tension and conflict while the impact of these factor is difficult to predict any one or more of these factor could adversely affect our operation in the future unauthorized access to our or our customer information and system could negatively impact our business we face certain security threat including threat to the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data and system we maintain an extensive network of technical security control policy enforcement mechanism monitoring system and management oversight in order to address these threat while these measure are designed to prevent detect and respond to unauthorized activity in our system certain type of attack including cyber attack could result in significant financial or information loss and or reputational harm in addition we manage information and information technology system for certain customer many of these customer face similar security threat if we can not prevent the unauthorized access release and or corruption of our customer confidential classified or personally identifiable information our reputation could be damaged and or we could face financial loss the outcome of litigation and of government inquiry and investigation involving our business is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could have material effect on our financial position and result of operation we are involved in number of litigation matter these matter may divert financial and management resource that would otherwise be used to benefit our operation no assurance can be given that the result of these matter will be favorable to an adverse resolution of any of these lawsuit or future lawsuit could have material impact on our financial position and result of operation in addition we of contentsare subject to extensive regulation under the law of the united state and it various state well other jurisdiction in which we operate result we are sometimes subject to government inquiry and investigation of our business due among other thing to our business relationship with the government the heavily regulated nature of our industry and in the case of environmental proceeding our current or past ownership of certain property any such inquiry or investigation could potentially result in an adverse ruling against which could have material impact on our financial position and result of operation significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customer and in certain type of boeing aircraft which expose to concentration risk significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customer and in distinct geographic region our portfolio is also concentrated by varying degree across boeing aircraft product type most notably and aircraft and among customer that we believe have le than investment grade credit if one or more customer holding significant portion of our portfolio asset experience financial difficulty or otherwise default on or doe not renew it lease with at their expiration and we are unable to redeploy the aircraft on reasonable term or if the type of aircraft that are concentrated in our portfolio suffer greater than expected decline in value our earnings cash flow and or financial position could be materially adversely affected we may be unable to obtain debt to fund our operation and contractual commitment at competitive rate on commercially reasonable term or in sufficient amount we depend in part upon the issuance of debt to fund our operation and contractual commitment of december and our airplane financing commitment totaled million and million if we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing commitment or meet other business requirement our market liquidity may not be sufficient number of factor could cause to incur increased borrowing cost and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private market for debt these factor include disruption or decline in the global capital market and or decline in our financial performance outlook or credit rating the occurrence of any or all of these event may adversely affect our ability to fund our operation and contractual or financing commitment we may not realize the anticipated benefit of merger acquisition joint venture strategic alliance or divestiture part of our business strategy we may merge with or acquire business and or form joint venture and strategic alliance whether we realize the anticipated benefit from these acquisition and related activity depends in part upon our ability to integrate the operation of the acquired business the performance of the underlying product and service portfolio and the performance of the management team and other personnel of the acquired operation accordingly our financial result could be adversely affected by unanticipated performance issue legacy liability transaction related charge amortization of expense related to intangible charge for impairment of long term asset credit guarantee partner performance and indemnification consolidation of joint venture could also impact our reported result of operation or financial position while we believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedure and process to mitigate these risk there is no assurance that these transaction will be successful we also may make strategic divestiture from time to time these transaction may result in continued financial involvement in the divested business such through guarantee or other financial arrangement following the transaction nonperformance by those divested business could affect our future financial result through additional payment obligation higher cost or asset write down of contentsour insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposure we are exposed to liability that are unique to the product and service we provide we maintain insurance for certain risk and in some circumstance we may receive indemnification from the government the amount of our insurance coverage may not cover all claim or liability and we may be forced to bear substantial cost for example liability arising from the use of certain of our product such aircraft technology missile system border security system anti terrorism technology and or air traffic management system may not be insurable on commercially reasonable term while some of these product are shielded from liability within the under the safety act provision of the homeland security act no such protection is available outside the potentially resulting in significant liability the amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover these or other claim or liability business disruption could seriously affect our future sale and financial condition or increase our cost and expense our business may be impacted by disruption including threat to physical security information technology or cyber attack or failure damaging weather or other act of nature and pandemic or other public health crisis any of these disruption could affect our internal operation or our ability to deliver product and service to our customer any significant production delay or any destruction manipulation or improper use of our data information system or network could impact our sale increase our expense and or have an adverse effect on the reputation of boeing and of our product and service some of our and our supplier workforce are represented by labor union which may lead to work stoppage approximately employee which constitute of our total

of sale and profit predominantly by bd and for defense contract at bgs contract accounting involves judgmental process of estimating the total sale and cost for each contract which result in the development of estimated cost of sale percentage for each contract the amount reported cost of sale is determined by applying the estimated cost of sale percentage to the amount of revenue recognized due to the size duration and nature of many of our contract the estimation of total sale and cost through completion is complicated and subject to many variable total contract sale estimate are based on negotiated contract price and quantity modified by our assumption regarding contract option change order incentive and award provision associated with technical performance and price adjustment clause such inflation or index based clause the majority of these contract are with the government where the price is generally based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit federal acquisition regulation provide guidance on the type of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price total contract cost estimate are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract term historical performance trend business base and other economic projection factor that influence these estimate include inflationary trend technical and schedule risk internal and subcontractor performance trend business volume assumption asset utilization and anticipated labor agreement revenue and cost estimate for all significant contract are reviewed and reassessed quarterly change in these estimate could result in recognition of cumulative catch up adjustment to the contract inception to date revenue cost of sale and profit in the period in which such change are made change in revenue and cost estimate could also result in reach forward loss or an adjustment to reach forward loss which would be recorded immediately in earnings for the year ended december net favorable cumulative catch up adjustment including reach forward loss across all contract increased earnings from operation by million for the year ended december and net unfavorable cumulative catch up adjustment including reach forward loss across all contract decreased earnings from operation by million and million due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above it is likely that materially different cost of sale amount could be recorded if we used different assumption or if the underlying circumstance were to change change in underlying assumption estimate supplier performance or circumstance may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future period if the combined gross margin for all contract in bd and defense contract at bgs for all of had been estimated to be higher or lower by it would have increased or decreased pre tax income for the year by approximately million in addition number of our fixed price development contract are in reach forward loss position change to estimated loss are recorded immediately in earnings program accountingprogram accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sale to cost for the defined program accounting quantity program consists of the estimated number of unit accounting quantity of product to be produced in continuing long term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contract the determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimate of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contract for each program the amount reported cost of sale is determined by applying the estimated cost of sale percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sale recognized for airplane delivered and accepted by the customer of contentsfactors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity sale price labor and employee benefit cost material cost procured part cost major component cost overhead cost program tooling and other non recurring cost and warranty cost estimation of the accounting quantity for each program take into account several factor that are indicative of the demand for the particular program such firm order letter of intent from prospective customer and market study total estimated program sale are determined by estimating the model mix and sale price for all unsold unit within the accounting quantity added together with the sale price for all undelivered unit under contract the sale price for all undelivered unit within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly cost estimate are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contract with supplier historical performance trend and business base and other economic projection factor that influence these estimate include production rate internal and subcontractor performance trend customer and or supplier claim or assertion asset utilization anticipated labor agreement and inflationary or deflationary trend to ensure reliability in our estimate we employ rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on quarterly basis change in estimate are normally recognized on prospective basis when estimated cost to complete program exceed estimated revenue from undelivered unit in the accounting quantity loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered unit in the accounting quantity for example in and we recorded reach forward loss of million and million on the program we continue to evaluate the viability of the program and it is reasonably possible that we could decide to end production of the the program method of accounting allocates tooling and other non recurring and production cost over the accounting quantity for each program because of the higher unit production cost experienced at the beginning of new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling and other non recurring cost new commercial aircraft program such the and program typically have lower initial margin than established program in addition actual cost incurred for earlier unit in excess of the estimated average cost of all unit in the program accounting quantity are included within program inventory deferred production cost deferred production unamortized tooling and other non recurring cost are expected to be fully recovered when all unit in the accounting quantity are delivered the expected unit cost for later delivery is below the estimated average cost learning curve and other improvement are realized due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above it is reasonably possible that change in underlying circumstance or assumption could have material effect on program gross margin if the combined gross margin percentage for our commercial airplane program had been estimated to be higher or lower it would have similar effect on the commercial airplane segment operating margin for the year ended december increase or decrease in operating margin for our commercial airplane segment would have million impact on operating earnings goodwill and indefinite lived intangible impairmentswe test goodwill for impairment by performing qualitative assessment or using two step impairment process if we choose to perform qualitative assessment we evaluate economic industry and company specific factor an initial step in assessing the fair value of operation if we determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net asset is more than the fair value of the related operation the two step impairment process is performed otherwise no further testing is required for operation where the two step impairment process is used we first compare the book value of net asset to the fair value of the related operation if the fair value is determined to be le than book value second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment in this process fair value for goodwill is estimated based in part on the fair value of the operation and is compared to it carrying value the shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment of contentswe estimate the fair value of the related operation using discounted cash flow forecast of future cash flow are based on our best estimate of future sale and operating cost based primarily on existing firm order expected future order contract with supplier labor agreement and general market condition change in these forecast could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded if any the cash flow forecast are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus suitable control premium at the date of evaluation therefore change in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded if any we completed our assessment of goodwill of april and determined that there is no impairment of goodwill result of the change in our reportable segment described in note we reallocated goodwill to our new reporting unit using relative fair value approach we evaluated goodwill for impairment at july and determined that no impairment existed of december we estimated that the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded it corresponding carrying value change in our forecast or decrease in the value of our common stock could cause book value of certain operation to exceed their fair value which may result in goodwill impairment charge in future period of december and we had million of indefinite lived intangible asset related to the jeppesen and aviall brand and trade name acquired in business combination we test these intangible for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projection of discounted cash flow attributable to the brand and trade name any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flow represents the amount of the impairment decrease in the discounted cash flow would not impact the carrying value of these indefinite lived intangible asset pension plansthe majority of our employee have earned benefit under defined benefit pension plan nonunion and the majority of union employee that had participated in defined benefit pension plan transitioned to company funded defined contribution retirement saving plan in accounting rule require an annual measurement of our projected obligation and plan asset these measurement are based upon several assumption including the discount rate and the expected long term rate of asset return future change in assumption or difference between actual and expected outcome can significantly affect our future annual expense projected benefit obligation and shareholder equity the following table show the sensitivity of our pension plan liability and net periodic cost to basis point change in the discount rate of december dollar in million change in discount rateincrease bps change in discount ratedecrease bpspension plan projected benefit obligation periodic pension cost expense is also sensitive to change in the expected long term rate of asset return decrease or increase of basis point in the expected long term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased net periodic pension expense by million we expect net periodic pension cost to decrease by approximately million and the portion recognized in earnings before income tax to decrease by approximately million primarily due to lower amortization of actuarial loss of contentsitem quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskinterest rate riskwe have financial instrument that are subject to interest rate risk principally fixed rate debt obligation and customer financing asset and liability additionally bcc us interest rate swap with certain debt obligation to manage exposure to interest rate change historically we have not experienced material gain or loss on our customer financing asset and liability due to interest rate change of december the impact over the next month of basis point rise in interest rate to our pre tax earnings would not be significant the investor in our fixed rate debt obligation do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligation prior to maturity therefore exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed rate debt foreign currency exchange rate riskwe are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipt from customer and payment to supplier in foreign currency we use foreign currency forward contract to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payment and receipt related to our ongoing business foreign currency forward contract are sensitive to change in foreign currency exchange rate at december increase or decrease in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contract would have increased or decreased our unrealized loss by million consistent with the use of these contract to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuation such unrealized loss or gain would be offset by corresponding gain or loss respectively in the remeasurement of the underlying transaction being hedged when taken together

reported earnings before income tax based on current tax law and also include in the current period the cumulative effect of any change in tax rate from those used previously in determining deferred tax asset and liability such provision differ from the amount currently receivable or payable because certain item of income and expense are recognized in different time period for financial reporting purpose than for income tax purpose significant judgment is required in determining income tax provision and evaluating tax position the accounting for uncertainty in income tax requires more likely

retirement saving plan in we also provide postretirement benefit plan other than pension consisting principally of health care coverage to eligible retiree and qualifying dependent benefit under the pension and other postretirement benefit plan are generally based on age at retirement and year of service and for some pension plan benefit are also based on the employee annual earnings the net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plan is determined using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumption the most significant of which are the discount rate the long term rate of asset return and medical trend rate of growth for medical cost portion of net periodic pension and other postretirement income or expense is not recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to production product cost and reflected in inventory at the end of reporting period actuarial gain and loss which occur when actual experience differs from

insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation accordingly these obligation have not been recorded in the consolidated financial statement liability for these obligation will be recorded in the period when sufficient information regarding timing and method of settlement becomes available to make reasonable estimate of the liability fair value in addition there may be conditional asset retirement obligation that we have not yet discovered asbestos may exist in certain building but we have not become aware of it through the normal course of business and therefore these obligation also have not been included in the consolidated financial statement goodwill and other acquired intangiblesgoodwill and other acquired intangible asset with indefinite life are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstance change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist our annual testing date is april we test goodwill for impairment by performing qualitative assessment or using two step impairment process if we choose to perform qualitative assessment and determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net asset is more than the fair value of the related operation the two step impairment process is then performed otherwise no further testing is required for operation where the two step impairment process is used we first compare the carrying value of net asset to the fair value of the related operation if the fair value is determined to be le than carrying value second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment in this process fair value for goodwill is estimated based in part on the fair value of the operation and is compared to it carrying value the shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment indefinite lived intangible consist of brand and trade name acquired in business combination we test these intangible for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projection of discounted cash flow attributable to the brand and trade name any excess carrying value over the amount

the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged the effect of that accounting is to include in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting change in fair value for our cash flow hedge the effective portion of the derivative gain or loss is initially reported in comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period or period during which the hedged forecasted transaction affect earnings the ineffective

aircraft sale aircraft we have entered into trade in commitment with certain customer that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at specified price upon the purchase of sale aircraft additionally we have entered into contingent repurchase commitment with certain customer wherein we agree to repurchase the sale aircraft at specified price generally to year after delivery of the sale aircraft our repurchase of the sale aircraft is contingent upon future mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft if we execute an agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft and if the customer exercise it right to sell the sale of contentsaircraft to contingent repurchase commitment would become trade in commitment our historical experience is that contingent repurchase commitment infrequently become trade in commitment exposure related to trade in commitment may take the form of adjustment to revenue for the difference between the contractual trade in price in the definitive agreement and our best estimate of the fair value of the trade in aircraft of the date of such agreement which would be recognized upon delivery of the sale aircraft and or charge to cost of product for adverse change in the fair value of trade in aircraft that occur subsequent to signing of definitive agreement for sale aircraft but prior to the purchase of the used trade in aircraft estimate based on current aircraft value would be included in accrued liability the fair value of trade in aircraft is determined using aircraft specific data such model age and condition market condition for specific aircraft and similar model and multiple valuation source this process us our assessment of the market for each trade in aircraft which in most instance begin year before the return of the aircraft there are several possible market in which we continually pursue opportunity to place used aircraft these market include but are not limited to the resale market which could potentially include the cost of long term storage the leasing market with the potential for refurbishment cost to meet the leasing customer requirement or the scrap market trade in aircraft valuation varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft on quarterly basis we update our valuation analysis based on the actual activity associated with placing each aircraft into market or using current published third party aircraft valuation based on the type and age of the aircraft adjusted for individual attribute and known condition used aircraft acquired by the commercial airplane segment are included in inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value it is our intent to sell these asset to mitigate cost and enhance marketability aircraft may be placed on operating lease while on operating lease the asset are included in customer financing customer financing customer financing includes operating lease equipment note receivable and sale type finance lease sale type finance lease are treated receivables and allowance for loss are established necessary we ass the fair value of the asset we own including equipment under operating lease asset held for sale or re lease and collateral underlying receivables to determine if their fair value are le than the related asset carrying value difference between carrying value and fair value of sale type finance lease and note and other receivables determined by collateral value are considered in determining the allowance for loss on receivables we use median calculated from published collateral value from multiple third party aircraft value publication based on the type and age of the aircraft to determine the fair value of aircraft under certain circumstance we apply judgment based on the attribute of the specific aircraft or equipment usually when the feature or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attribute covered by outside publication impairment review for asset under operating lease and held for sale or re lease we evaluate for impairment asset under operating lease or asset held for sale or re lease when event or change in circumstance indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be le than the carrying value we use various assumption when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow including our intention for how long we will hold an asset subject to operating lease before it is sold the expected future lease rate lease term residual value of the asset period in which the asset may be held in preparation for follow on lease maintenance cost remarketing cost and the remaining economic of contentslife of the asset we record asset held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value le cost to sell when we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset allowance for loss on customer financing receivables we record the potential impairment of customer financing receivables in valuation account the balance of which is an accounting estimate of probable but unconfirmed loss the allowance for loss on receivables relates to two component of receivables receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment and all other receivables we determine receivable is impaired when based on current information and event it is probable that we will be unable to collect amount due according to the original contractual term of the receivable agreement without regard to any subsequent restructurings factor considered in assessing collectability include but are not limited to customer extended delinquency request for restructuring and filing for bankruptcy we determine specific impairment allowance based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated fair value of the related collateral we would expect to realize we review the adequacy of the allowance attributable to the remaining receivables after excluding receivables subject to specific impairment allowance by assessing both the collateral exposure and the applicable cumulative default rate collateral exposure for particular receivable is the excess of the carrying value of the receivable over the fair value of the related collateral receivable with an estimated fair value in excess of the carrying value is considered to have no collateral exposure the applicable cumulative default rate is determined using two component customer credit rating and weighted average remaining contract term internally assigned credit rating our credit quality indicator are determined for each customer in the portfolio those rating are updated based upon public information and information obtained directly from our customer we have entered into agreement with certain customer that would entitle to look beyond the specific collateral underlying the receivable for purpose of determining the collateral exposure described above should the proceeds from the sale of the underlying collateral asset resulting from default condition be insufficient to cover the carrying value of our receivable creating shortfall condition these agreement would for example permit to take the action necessary to sell or retain certain other asset in which the customer ha an equity interest and use the proceeds to cover the shortfall each quarter we review customer credit rating published historical credit default rate for different rating category and multiple third party aircraft value publication basis to validate the reasonableness of the allowance for loss on receivables there can be no assurance that actual result will not differ from estimate or that the consideration of these factor in the future will not result in an increase or decrease to the allowance for loss on receivables

residual value guarantee where we received cash premium the liability is equal to the cash premium received at the guarantee inception for credit guarantee the liability is equal to the present value of the expected loss we determine the expected loss by multiplying the creditor default rate by the guarantee amount reduced by the expected recovery if applicable for each future period the credit guarantee will be outstanding if at inception of guarantee we determine there is probable related contingent loss we will recognize liability for the greater of the fair value of the guarantee described above or the probable contingent loss amount standard issued and not yet implementedin february the financial accounting standard board issued accounting standard update asu no lease topic the new standard is effective for reporting period beginning after december and early adoption is permitted the standard will require lessee to report most lease asset and liability on the balance sheet while lessor accounting will remain substantially unchanged the standard requires modified retrospective transition approach for existing lease whereby the new rule will be applied to the earliest year presented we plan to adopt the new lease standard in and do not expect it to have material effect on our financial position result of operation or cash flow we are adopting asu no revenue from contract with customer topic in the first quarter of using the retrospective transition method which will require and financial statement to be restated the new standard requires revenue to be recognized when promised good or service are transferred to customer in amount that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those good or service the standard also requires expanded disclosure regarding revenue and contract with customer of contentsmost of our defense contract at bd and bgs that have historically recognized revenue delivery are made or based on the attainment of performance milestone will recognize revenue under the new standard over time cost are incurred certain military derivative aircraft contract included in our bca segment will also recognize revenue cost are incurred the new standard will not change the total amount of revenue recognized on these contract only accelerate the timing of when the revenue is recognized in addition the timing of cost of sale recognition for these contract will be accelerated resulting in decrease in inventory from long term contract in progress the new standard will not affect revenue recognition or the use of program accounting for commercial airplane contract we will continue to recognize revenue for these contract at the point in time when the customer accepts delivery of the airplane because revenue will be recognized under the new standard cost are incurred for most of our defense and military derivative airplane contract approximately of revenue and of associated operating earnings will be accelerated into year ending prior to january the restatement will result in cumulative adjustment to increase retained earnings by effective january restated income statement for and are shown below we are also adopting asu no compensation retirement benefit topic improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost in the first quarter of the standard requires non service cost component of net periodic benefit cost to be presented in non operating earnings using retrospective transition method which will require to restate and in the first quarter of in addition only service cost may be allocated to production cost and capitalized in inventory on prospective basis effective january adoption in the first quarter of is expected to result in reclassification of non service cost component of net periodic benefit cost of in and in from earnings from operation to other income loss net we applied
