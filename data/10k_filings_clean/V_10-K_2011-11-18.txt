standard pci ds there ha been significant progress in growing industry adoption of pci ds with more than percent of the largest merchant validating compliance annually government regulation general government regulation affect key aspect of our business our client are also subject to numerous regulation applicable to bank and other financial institution in the united state and elsewhere and consequently such regulation have the potential to affect our business indirectly in recent year our business ha come under increasing regulatory scrutiny see item risk factor increased global regulatory focus on the payment industry may result in costly new compliance burden on our client and on leading to increased cost and decreased payment volume and revenue the reform act noted during the fiscal year the federal reserve established new rule under the reform act affecting interchange reimbursement fee network exclusivity and transaction routing we expect these rule to have an adverse impact on our pricing reduce the number and volume of debit payment we process and decrease associated revenue see item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation overview and item risk factor the reform act may have material adverse effect on our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business we have significantly modified our debit strategy result see overview interchange reimbursement fee we have historically set default interchange reimbursement fee in the united state and many other geography the new rule under the reform act set the maximum debit interchange reimbursement fee assessed for card issued by large financial institution at twenty one cent plus five basis point before applying an interim fraud adjustment up to an additional one cent this amount to significant reduction from the average system wide fee charged previously see item risk factor the reform act may have material adverse effect on our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business item risk factor increasing regulation of interchange reimbursement fee and other business practice may have material adverse impact on our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business and item financial statement and supplementary data note legal matter elsewhere in this report the united state is not the only jurisdiction to regulate interchange reimbursement fee for example the reserve bank of australia ha enacted regulation limiting the cost that can be considered in setting interchange reimbursement fee for both our credit and our debit card interchange reimbursement fee represent transfer of value among the financial institution participating in an open loop payment network such on purchase transaction interchange reimbursement fee are paid to issuer by acquirer in connection with transaction initiated from product in our payment system we generally do not receive any portion of interchange reimbursement fee in transaction they are however factor on which we compete with other payment provider and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transaction we process default interchange reimbursement fee are an important driver of system volume and value they promote the efficient operation of our payment network by enabling both the issuer and the acquirer to understand the economics of given transaction before entering into it and by giving our client an alternative to negotiating transfer pricing with each other by establishing and modifying default interchange rate in response to marketplace condition and strategic demand we seek to ensure competitive value proposition for transaction using our card in order to encourage electronic table of content transaction and to maximize participation in the visa payment system by issuer and acquirer and ultimately consumer and merchant we believe that proper management of interchange rate benefit consumer merchant our financial institution client and by promoting the overall growth of our payment network in competition with other payment card system and other form of payment and by creating incentive for innovation enhanced data quality and security merchant do not directly pay interchange reimbursement fee merchant cost of acceptance is determined by it acquirer and is called merchant discount or merchant discount rate the merchant discount typically cover the cost that acquirer incur for participation in open loop payment network including those relating to interchange and compensates them for various other service they provide to merchant merchant discount rate and other merchant fee are set by our acquirer without our involvement and by agreement with their merchant client and are established in competition with other acquirer other payment card system and other form of payment we do not establish or regulate the level of merchant discount rate or any other fee charged by our acquirer network exclusivity and routing we have agreement with some issuer under which they agree to issue certain payment card that use only the visa network or receive incentive if they do so in addition issuer of some debit product choose to include only the visa network we refer to these various practice network exclusivity in addition certain network or issuer rule or practice may be interpreted limiting the routing option of merchant when multiple debit network co reside on visa debit card for example visa rule require that an acquirer must process authorization for all international transaction through visanet and that member must clear international transaction through visanet issue relating to network exclusivity and the routing of transaction over visanet are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdiction in which our card are used most notably the new rule under the reform act limit our and issuer ability to impose rule for or choose various form of network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit area the rule require issuer to make at least two unaffiliated network available for processing debit transaction on each debit card the rule also prohibit and issuer from restricting merchant ability to direct the routing of electronic debit transaction over any of the network that an issuer ha enabled to process those transaction another example the canadian ministry of finance ha implemented voluntary code of conduct for payment card industry participant with which visa ha agreed to comply among other thing the code of conduct prohibits certain restriction on merchant choice of payment option they will accept see item risk factor the reform act may have material adverse effect on our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business and item risk factor regulation that prohibit from contracting with client or requiring them to use only our network or denying them the option of selecting only our network may decrease the number of transaction we process and materially and adversely affect our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business consumer financial protection bureau the reform act created new independent consumer financial protection bureau with responsibility for most federal consumer protection law in the area of financial service and new authority with respect to consumer protection issue including those pertaining to to some extent the bureau future action may make payment card transaction le attractive to card issuer consumer and merchant by regulating the industry no surcharge rule we have historically implemented policy that prohibit merchant from charging higher price to consumer who pay using visa instead of other mean several jurisdiction have expressed an interest in putting an end to these no surcharge rule most recently the reserve table of content bank of australia ha enacted regulation stopping from prohibiting merchant from imposing surcharge on customer who use visa affecting the manner in which we conduct our business there data protection and information security we devote substantial resource to maintain and to continually refine our information security program in order to comply with federal and state and foreign regulation safeguarding cardholder information and requiring consumer notification in the event of security breach in addition the federal financial institution examination council periodically review certain of our operation in the united state to ensure our compliance with data integrity security and operational requirement and standard well other requirement applicable to because of our role service provider to financial institution anti money laundering anti terrorism and sanctioned country in response to and other regulation we devote substantial resource to maintain and to continually refine program to prevent the use of our payment system to facilitate money laundering and the financing of terrorist activity we also prohibit from being visa member all financial institution that are domiciled in country sanctioned by the treasury office of foreign asset control currently cuba iran myanmar syria and sudan in addition we refrain from any financial dealing with restricted third party such identified money laundering front for terrorist and narcotic trafficker government imposed market participation restriction our business reach remains limited by certain country protection of domestic payment card provider or payment processing provider most notably our financial institution client in china may not issue card carrying our brand for domestic use in china limiting our opportunity in that market regulator in australia mexico colombia india singapore russia and malaysia have received statutory authority to regulate certain aspect of the payment system in these country regulation of internet transaction many jurisdiction have adopted or are in the process of adopting new regulation and tax on internet transaction most notably we have to implement compliance program in response to new regulation requiring the coding and blocking of payment for certain type of internet gambling transaction in addition the congress continues it consideration of regulatory initiative in the area of internet prescription drug purchase copyright and trademark infringement and privacy among others that could impose additional compliance burden on and or our client some state are considering variety of similar legislation if implemented these initiative could require or our client to monitor filter restrict or otherwise oversee various category of payment card transaction thereby increasing our cost or decreasing our transaction volume various regulatory agency also continue to examine wide variety of issue

reimbursement fee and other business practice may have material adverse impact on our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business interchange reimbursement fee represent transfer of value among the financial institution participating in payment network such ours in connection with transaction initiated with product in our payment system interchange reimbursement fee are typically paid to issuer the financial institution that issue visa card to cardholder the fee are typically paid by acquirer the financial institution that offer visa network connectivity and payment acceptance service to merchant we refer to system like ours in which payment network intermediate between the issuer and the acquirer an open loop system we generally do not receive any portion of interchange reimbursement fee in transaction they are however factor on which we compete with other payment provider and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transaction we process consequently change to these fee could substantially affect our revenue and the pace or breadth of overall payment electronification we have historically set default interchange reimbursement fee in the united state and many other geography however in certain jurisdiction interchange rate and related practice are subject to continuing or increased government regulation the reform act ha already resulted in limitation on our ability to establish default interchange rate in the debit area in the united state see the reform act may have material adverse effect on our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business in addition interchange rate have become subject to continued or increased scrutiny elsewhere and regulatory authority and central bank in number of jurisdiction have reviewed or are reviewing these rate these jurisdiction include australia canada brazil and south africa if we can not set default interchange rate at optimal level issuer and acquirer may find our payment system unattractive this could materially lower overall transaction volume or slow growth of table of content transaction in the future it could also materially increase the attractiveness of closed loop payment system those with direct connection to both merchant and consumer and other form of payment in addition issuer could begin to charge new or higher fee to consumer this could make our card program le desirable and reduce our transaction volume and profitability acquirer could elect to charge higher discount rate to merchant regardless of the level of visa interchange leading merchant not to accept card for payment or to steer visa cardholder to alternate payment system in addition issuer and acquirer could attempt to decrease the expense of their card program by seeking incentive from or reduction in the fee that we charge any of the foregoing could have substantial adverse impact on our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business regulation that prohibit from contracting with client or requiring them to use only our network or denying them the option of selecting only our network may decrease the number of transaction we process and materially and adversely affect our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business in order to ensure our cardholder have consistent experience we promote certain practice to ensure that visa branded card are processed over our network we have agreement with some issuer under which they agree to issue certain payment card that use only the visa network or receive incentive if they do so in addition certain issuer of some debit product choose to include only the visa network we refer to these various practice network exclusivity in addition certain network or issuer rule or practice may be interpreted limiting the routing option of merchant when multiple debit network co reside on visa debit card for example visa rule require that an acquirer must process authorization for all international transaction through visanet and that member must clear international transaction through visanet the reform act already limit our and issuer ability to impose rule for or choose various form of network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit area see the reform act may have material adverse effect on our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business these restriction and future regulation like them in the united state and elsewhere could cause material decrease in the number of transaction we process in order to retain that transaction volume we might have to reduce the fee we charge to issuer or acquirer or we might have to increase the payment and other incentive we provide to issuer or acquirer or directly to merchant any of these eventuality could have material adverse affect on our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business the reform act may have material adverse effect on our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business of october in accordance with the reform act the federal reserve capped the maximum debit interchange fee assessed for card issued by large financial institution at twenty one cent plus five basis point before applying an interim fraud adjustment up to an additional one cent this amounted to significant reduction from the average system wide fee charged previously the federal reserve ha also promulgated regulation requiring issuer to make at least two unaffiliated network available for processing debit transaction on each debit card the rule also prohibit and issuer from restricting merchant ability to direct the routing of electronic debit transaction over any of the network that an issuer ha enabled to process those transaction we expect these regulation to adversely affect our debit business and associated revenue they will likely create negative pressure on our pricing reduce the volume and number of debit payment we process and diminish associated revenue table of content these pressure will likely arise through various channel number of our client may seek fee reduction or increased incentive from to offset their own lost revenue some have announced that they may reduce the number of debit card they issue and reduce investment they make in marketing and reward program some may impose new or higher fee on debit card or demand deposit account relationship some may elect to issue fewer card enabled with visa affiliated network we expect many merchant to use the routing regulation to redirect transaction or steer cardholder to other network based on lowest cost or other factor because we may have to examine and possibly renegotiate certain of our contract to ensure that their term comply with new regulation these and other client will have the opportunity to renegotiate term relating to fee incentive and routing in some case we may lose placement completely on issuer debit card the reform act created new independent consumer financial protection bureau with responsibility for most federal consumer protection law in the area of financial service and new authority with respect to consumer protection issue including those pertaining to to some extent the bureau future action may make payment card transaction le attractive to card issuer consumer and merchant by further regulating disclosure payment card practice fee routing and other matter with respect to credit debit and prepaid some element of the reform act are vague or lack definition and create the potential for network to pursue different strategy subject to their interpretation of the regulation our interpretation may result in our pursuit of strategy le effective than those of our competitor overall these regulation and development arising from the reform act could have material adverse affect on our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business new regulation or legal action in one jurisdiction or of one product segment may lead to new regulation in other jurisdiction or of other product regulator around the world increasingly note each other approach to the regulation of the payment industry consequently development in any one country state or region may influence regulatory approach in another the reform act is one notable such development similarly new law and regulation in country state or region involving one product segment may cause lawmaker there to extend the regulation to another product for example regulation like those affecting debit payment could eventually spread to regulate credit result the risk created by any one new law or regulation are magnified by the potential they have to be replicated affecting our business in another place or involving another product segment these include matter like interchange reimbursement fee network exclusivity operating regulation and preferred routing agreement conversely if widely varying regulation come into existence worldwide we may have difficulty adjusting our product service fee and other important aspect of our business either of these eventuality could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation government action may prevent from competing effectively against provider of domestic payment service in certain country materially and adversely affecting our ability to maintain or increase our revenue government in some country provide resource or protection to selected domestic payment card network brand and processing provider these government may take this action in order to support these provider they may also take this action to keep from entering these country to table of content force to leave or to restrict substantially our activity there for example the government of china significant emerging market ha increasingly tightened it rule requiring use of domestic network additionally government in some country may consider regulatory requirement that mandate processing of domestic payment entirely in that country this would prevent from utilizing our global processing capability for our client our effort to effect change in these country may not succeed this could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenue and extend our global brand regulation in the area of consumer privacy and data use and security could decrease the number of payment card issued our payment volume and our revenue recently privacy data use and security have received heightened legislative and regulatory focus in the united state at the federal and state level and in other country for example in many jurisdiction consumer must be notified in the event of data breach these measure may materially increase our cost and our client cost they may also decrease the number of our card our client issue this would materially and adversely affect our profitability in addition our failure or the failure of our client to comply with these law and regulation could result in fine sanction litigation and damage to our global reputation and our brand increased global regulatory focus on the payment industry may result in costly new compliance burden on our client and on leading to increased cost and decreased payment volume and revenue regulation of the payment industry ha increased significantly in recent year complying with these and other regulation may increase our cost or reduce our revenue opportunity similarly the impact of such regulation on our client may reduce the volume of payment we process moreover such regulation could limit the type of product and service that we offer the country in which our card are used and the type of cardholder and merchant who can obtain or accept our card any of these occurrence could materially and adversely affect our business prospect for future growth financial condition and result of operation example include data protection and information security aspect of our operation and business are subject to privacy regulation in the united state and elsewhere our financial institution client in the united state are subject to similar requirement under the guideline issued by the federal banking agency in addition many state have enacted legislation requiring consumer notification in the event of security breach anti money laundering anti terrorism and sanction the patriot act and similar law in other jurisdiction require to maintain an anti money laundering program sanction imposed by the treasury office of foreign asset control or ofac restrict from dealing with certain country and party considered to be connected with money laundering terrorism or narcotic non visa international member may not be similarly restricted so in some case our payment system may be used for transaction in or involving country or party subject to ofac administered sanction potentially subjecting to penalty reputational damage or loss of business regulation of the price of credit many jurisdiction in which our card are used have new or proposed regulation that could increase the cost of card issuance or decrease the flexibility of card issuer to charge interest rate and fee on credit card account these include the credit card act and proposed regulation under it they also include proposed change to the federal truth in lending act which if implemented along with regulation required to be table of content promulgated under the credit card act could result in decrease in our payment volume and revenue increased central bank oversight several central bank around the world have increased or are seeking to increase their formal oversight of the retail electronic payment industry in some case designating them systemically important payment system such oversight may lead to additional regulation these could include new settlement procedure or other operational rule to address credit and operational risk they could also include new criterion for member participation and merchant access to our payment system safety and soundness regulation recent federal banking regulation may make some financial institution le attracted to becoming an issuer of our card because they may be subject to more conservative accounting procedure increased risk management or higher capital requirement regulation of internet transaction proposed legislation in various jurisdiction may make it le desirable or more costly to complete internet transaction using our card by affecting the legality of those transaction the law that governs them their taxation and the allocation of intellectual property right litigation risk our retrospective responsibility plan may not adequately insulate from the impact of settlement or final judgment our retrospective responsibility plan address monetary liability from settlement of or final judgment in the covered litigation which is described in note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report the retrospective responsibility plan consists of several related mechanism to fund settlement or judgment in the covered litigation these include an escrow account funded with portion of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and potential subsequent offering of our share of class common stock or deposit of cash to the escrow account in lieu of such offering loss sharing agreement and judgment sharing agreement in addition our member are obligated to indemnify pursuant to visa certificate of incorporation and bylaw and in accordance with their membership agreement these mechanism are unique complicated and tiered and if we can not use one or more of them this could have material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flow or in certain circumstance even cause to become insolvent the principal remaining covered litigation involves interchange reimbursement fee since approximately class action and individual complaint have been filed on behalf of merchant against mastercard and or other defendant including certain financial institution that issue visa branded payment card and acquire visa branded payment transaction in the we refer to this the interchange litigation among other antitrust allegation the plaintiff allege that visa setting of default interchange rate violated federal and state antitrust law the lawsuit have been transferred to multidistrict litigation in the district court for the eastern district of new york the plaintiff in the interchange litigation seek damage for alleged overcharge in merchant discount fee well injunctive and other relief the consolidated class action complaint alleges that the plaintiff estimate that damage will range in the ten of billion of dollar because these lawsuit were brought under the federal antitrust law any actual damage will be trebled the allocation of any monetary judgment or settlement among the defendant is governed by an omnibus agreement dated february see note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement included in item in this report table of content the visa portion of settlement or judgment covered by the omnibus agreement would be allocated in accordance with specified provision of our retrospective responsibility plan failure of our retrospective responsibility plan to insulate adequately from the impact of such settlement or judgment could result in material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flow and could even cause to become insolvent even if our retrospective responsibility plan covered our monetary liability settlement or judgment in the interchange litigation could have material adverse effect on our result of operation in addition settlement or judgment in the interchange litigation could include restriction on our ability to conduct business which could increase our cost of business and limit our prospect for future growth the retrospective responsibility plan address only the covered litigation the plan doe not cover other pending litigation or any litigation that we may face in the future except for case that include claim for damage relating to the period prior to our initial public offering that are transferred for pre trial proceeding or otherwise included in the interchange litigation in addition our retrospective responsibility plan cover only the potential monetary liability from settlement of or judgment in the covered litigation non monetary settlement term and judgment in the covered litigation may require to modify the way we do business in the future this could adversely affect our revenue increase our expense and or limit our prospect for growth therefore even if our retrospective responsibility plan provides with adequate funding to satisfy our monetary obligation with respect to settlement of and judgment in the covered litigation it may not insulate from all potential adverse consequence of them if we are found liable in certain other pending or future lawsuit we may have to pay substantial damage or change our business practice or pricing structure which may have material adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operation like many other large company we are defendant in number of civil action and investigation alleging violation of competition antitrust law consumer protection law or intellectual property law among others example of such claim are described more fully in note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement included in item in this report some lawsuit involve complex claim that are subject to substantial uncertainty and unspecified damage therefore we can not ascertain the probability of loss or estimate the damage accordingly we have not established allowance for such legal proceeding private plaintiff often seek class action certification in case against this is particularly so in case involving merchant and consumer due to the size and scope of our business if we are found liable in large class action lawsuit such the united state or canadian merchant class action lawsuit monetary damage could be significant see note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement included in item in this report if we are unsuccessful in our defense against any material current or future legal proceeding we may have to pay substantial damage we may also have to change our business practice including by limiting interchange reimbursement fee and by revising our rule about fee charged to consumer who choose to pay with visa this could limit our payment volume and result in material and adverse effect on our revenue result of operation cash flow financial condition prospect for future growth and overall business and could even cause to become insolvent limitation on our business that resulted from litigation may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability certain limitation have been placed on our business in recent year because of litigation for example in october we reached settlement with the department of justice or the doj table of content and number of state attorney general relating to their investigation of certain visa merchant acceptance practice in accordance with the resulting consent decree visa will allow merchant to offer discount or other incentive to steer cardholder to particular form of payment including to specific network brand or to any card product such non reward visa credit card see note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report the settlement doe not address surcharging or the setting of default interchange and doe not preclude the doj from pursuing future investigation of these or other topic this settlement and other limitation on our business that were the result of settlement of or judgment in litigation could limit the fee we charge and reduce our payment volume which could materially and adversely affect our revenue operating result prospect for future growth and overall business tax examination or dispute or change in the tax law applicable to could materially increase our tax payment we exercise significant judgment in calculating our worldwide provision for income tax and other tax liability although we believe our tax estimate are reasonable many factor may decrease their accuracy we are currently under examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authority and we may be subject to additional examination in the future the tax authority may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material item and thereby increase our tax liability failure to sustain our position in these matter could result in material and adverse effect on our cash flow and financial position in addition change in existing law such recent proposal for fundamental and international tax reform may also increase our effective tax rate substantial increase in our tax burden could have material adverse effect on our financial result see also note income tax to our consolidated financial statement included in item in this report our agreement with visa europe includes indemnity obligation that could expose to significant liability under our framework agreement with visa europe we indemnify it for loss resulting from all claim outside it region arising from our or their activity and relating to our or their payment business this obligation applies even if neither we nor any of our related party or agent participated in the action giving rise to such claim such an obligation could expose to significant liability for activity over which we have little or no control our retrospective responsibility plan would not cover these liability business risk the intense pressure we face on client pricing may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profit we offer incentive to client in order to increase payment volume enter new market segment and expand our card base these include up front cash payment fee discount credit performance based incentive marketing support payment and other support over the past several year we have increased the use of incentive such up front cash payment and fee discount in many country including the united state in order to stay competitive we may have to continue to increase our use of incentive the economic pressure on our client arising from the reform act have increased this pressure see the wall street reform and consumer protection act may have material adverse impact on our table of content revenue our prospect for future growth and our overall business this pressure may make the provision of certain product and service le profitable or unprofitable and materially and adversely affect our operating revenue and profitability pressure on client pricing also pose indirect risk presenting the potential for the adverse effect if we continue to increase incentive to our client we will need to find way to offset the financial impact by increasing payment volume the amount of fee based service we provide or both we may not succeed in doing so particularly in the current regulatory environment in addition we benefit from long term contract with certain client including those that are large contributor to our revenue continued pressure on our fee could prevent from entering into such agreement in the future on favorable term we may also have to modify existing agreement in order to maintain relationship or comply with regulation finally increased pricing pressure enhances the importance of cost containment and productivity initiative in area other than those surrounding client incentive and we may not succeed in these effort our business financial condition and result of operation may suffer because of intense competition in our industry the global payment industry is intensely competitive our payment program compete against all form of payment these include cash check and electronic transaction such wire transfer and automatic clearinghouse payment in addition our payment program compete against the card based payment system of our competitor and private label card issued by merchant the reform act ha increased this competitive pressure some of our competitor may develop substantially greater financial and other resource than we have they may offer wider range of program and service than we do they may use advertising and marketing strategy that are more effective than ours achieving broader brand recognition and merchant acceptance than we do they may develop better security solution or more favorable pricing arrangement than we have they may also introduce more innovative program and service than we provide certain of our competitor operate with different business model have different cost structure or participate selectively in different market segment these include domestic network in the united state china canada australia and other country and region they may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to new regulatory technological and other development in many case these competitor have the support of government mandate that prohibit limit or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for or otherwise secure transaction within those country and region traditional or non traditional competitor may put at competitive disadvantage by leveraging service or product in area in which we do not directly compete to win business in area where we do compete our client can reassess their commitment to at any time or develop their own competitive service the risk to maintaining or securing our client long term commitment to our product ha increased with the reform act restriction on network exclusivity in the debit sector most of our larger client relationship are not exclusive these include those with our largest client jpmorgan chase and bank of america in certain circumstance our client may terminate these relationship sometimes on relatively short notice and in many case subject to significant early termination fee because significant portion of our operating revenue is concentrated among our largest client our operating revenue would decline significantly if we lost one or more of them this could have material adverse impact on our business financial condition and result of operation see note enterprise wide disclosure and concentration of business to our consolidated financial statement included in item in this report table of content we expect there to be change in the competitive landscape in the future for example competitor client and others may develop product that compete with or replace the value added service we provide to support our transaction processing party that process our transaction in certain country may try to eliminate our position in the payment value chain participant in the payment industry may merge form joint venture or enter into other business combination that strengthen their existing business proposition or create new competing payment service or competition may increase from alternative type of payment service such mobile payment service online payment service and service that permit direct debit of consumer checking account or ach payment our failure to compete effectively in light of any such development could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business disintermediation from the payment value chain would harm our business our position in the payment value chain underpins our business certain of our competitor including american express discover private label card network and certain alternative payment system operate closed loop payment system with direct connection to both merchant and consumer and no intermediary these competitor seek to derive competitive advantage from this business model the reform act ha provided them with increased opportunity to do so in addition although they pursue the same or similar line of business using the same or similar business and commercial model they have not attracted the same level of legal or regulatory scrutiny of their pricing and business practice operator of multi party payment system such ours we also run the risk of disintermediation by virtue of increasing bilateral agreement between entity that would rather not use payment network for processing payment for example merchant could process transaction directly with issuer or processor could process transaction directly between issuer and acquirer additional consolidation in the banking industry could result in our losing business and create pressure on the fee we charge our client materially and adversely affecting our revenue and profitability the banking industry ha recently undergone substantial accelerated consolidation which could continue significant ongoing consolidation in the banking industry may result in the acquisition of one or more of our largest client by an institution with strong relationship with one of our competitor this could result in the acquired bank visa business shifting to that competitor resulting in substantial loss of business to in addition one or more of our client could merge with or acquire one of our competitor shifting it payment volume to that competitor any such transaction could have material adverse effect on our business and prospect continued consolidation in the banking industry would also reduce the overall number of our client and potential client and could increase the negotiating power of our remaining client and potential client this consolidation could lead financial institution to seek greater pricing discount or other incentive with in addition consolidation could prompt our existing client to seek to renegotiate their pricing agreement with to obtain more favorable term we may also be adversely affected by price compression should one of our client absorb another financial institution and qualify table of content for higher volume based discount on the combined volume of the merged business pressure on the fee we charge our client caused by such consolidation could materially and adversely affect our revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business in addition the current economic environment could lead some client to curtail or postpone near term investment in growing their card portfolio limit credit line or take other action that affect adversely the growth of our volume and revenue stream from these client merchant continued focus on the cost associated with payment card acceptance may result in more litigation regulation regulatory enforcement and incentive arrangement we rely in part on merchant and their relationship with our client to maintain and expand the acceptance of our payment card consolidation in the retail industry is producing group of larger merchant that is significant impact on all participant in the global payment industry some merchant are seeking to reduce their cost associated with payment card acceptance by lobbying for new legislation and regulatory enforcement and by bringing litigation if they continue these effort could materially and adversely affect our revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business we well our client negotiate pricing discount and other incentive arrangement with certain large merchant to increase acceptance and usage of our payment card if merchant continue to consolidate we and our client may have to increase the incentive provided to certain larger merchant this could materially and adversely affect our revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business competitive and regulatory pressure on pricing could make it difficult to offset the cost of these incentive certain financial institution have exclusive or nearly exclusive relationship with our competitor to issue payment card and these relationship may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenue certain financial institution have longstanding exclusive or nearly exclusive relationship with our competitor to issue payment card these relationship may make it difficult or cost prohibitive for to conduct material amount of business with them in order to increase our revenue in addition these financial institution may be more successful and may grow more quickly than our client which could put at competitive disadvantage failure to maintain relationship with our client merchant acquirer merchant and third party vendor and the failure of client to provide service on our behalf could materially and adversely affect our business we depend and will continue to depend significantly on relationship with our client and on their relationship with cardholder and merchant to support our program and service we do not have direct relationship with cardholder we do not issue card extend credit to cardholder or determine the interest rate if any or other fee charged to cardholder using card that carry our brand each issuer determines these and most other competitive card feature result the success of our business ha depended significantly on and will continue to depend on the continued success and competitiveness of our client and the strength of our relationship with them historically we have not solicited merchant to accept our card in the wake of the reform act change to rule on network exclusivity we expect to engage in significantly more discussion with merchant and merchant acquirer we already engage in many co branding effort in which we contract with the merchant who directly receives incentive funding we also engage in some amount of merchant acceptance activity these and other relationship take on greater importance for both table of content merchant and our success will increasingly depend on our ability to sustain and grow these relationship in many country outside the united state our client or other processor authorize clear and settle most domestic transaction using our payment card without involving our processing system this pattern is increasing with rise in new system endorsed by government our inability to control the end to end processing for card carrying our brand in these country may put at competitive disadvantage by limiting our ability to ensure the quality of the service supporting our brand in addition we depend on third party to provide various service on our behalf and to the extent that third party vendor fail to deliver service our business and reputation could be impaired the perception of our company in the marketplace may affect our brand and reputation which are key asset of our business our brand and their attribute are key asset of our business the ability to attract and retain consumer cardholder and corporate client to visa branded product depends highly upon the external perception of our company and our industry our business may be affected by action taken by our client that change the perception of our brand from time to time our client may take action that we do not believe to be in the best interest of our brand such creditor practice that may be subject to challenge which may materially and adversely affect our business further visa europe ha broad latitude to operate the visa business in and use our brand and technology within visa europe region in which we have only limited control over the operation of the visa business visa europe is not required to spend any minimum amount of money promoting or building the visa brand in it region and the strength of the visa global brand depends in part on the effort of visa europe to maintain product and service recognition and quality in europe finally adverse development with respect to our industry may also by association impair our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny unprecedented economic event in financial market around the world have and are likely to continue to affect our client merchant and cardholder resulting in material and adverse impact on our prospect growth profitability revenue and overall business unprecedented economic event that began in continue to affect the financial market around the world these include decreased consumer spending increased unemployment deflation increased saving decreased consumer debt excess housing inventory lowered government spending decreased export activity continued challenge in the credit environment continued equity market volatility additional government intervention bank instability downgrade of sovereign bank and commercial debt political issue affecting the handling of national debt and the uncertainty arising from new government policy this economic turmoil ha affected the economy of the united state and other mature economy in particular the fragility of the current situation would be exacerbated if additional negative economic development were to arise these could include among other thing policy misstep exhaustion of and other national economic stimulus package default on government debt in the united state europe or elsewhere significant increase in oil price tax increase economic turmoil in china the euro zone or japan or significant decline in the commercial real estate market most recently the economic situation in europe ha been particularly unstable arising from the real prospect of default by greece and potentially other nation on their debt obligation if such default occurs or if the measure taken to avert such default create their own instability the impact is likely to be global and highly significant table of content some existing client have been placed in receivership or under government administration many financial institution are facing increased regulatory and governmental influence including potential change in law and regulation many of our client merchant that accept our brand and cardholder who use our brand have been directly and adversely affected our financial result may be negatively affected by action taken by individual financial institution or by governmental or regulatory body in response to the economic crisis the severity of the economic environment may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risk to our financial performance that have historically been present result our revenue growth ha been and may continue to be negatively affected or we may be affected in several way including but not limited to the following depressed consumer and business confidence may decrease cardholder spending uncertainty and volatility in the performance of our client business may reduce the accuracy of our estimate of our revenue rebate incentive and realization of prepaid asset our client may implement cost reduction initiative that reduce or eliminate payment card marketing or increase request for greater incentive or additional expense reduction which may reduce our revenue our client may decrease spending for optional or enhanced service affecting our revenue and reducing cardholder desire to use these product our client may increase cardholder fee cost recovery initiative or result of regulatory action which could decrease our value proposition to consumer thereby reducing consumer desire to use our product government intervention or investment in our client may negatively affect our business with those institution or otherwise alter their strategic direction away from our product tightening of credit availability could affect the ability of participating financial institution to lend to under the term of our credit facility the trading market for government security may be adversely affected by change in investor sentiment this could arise from number of market force including among others the government inability to meet it obligation or possible further downgrade in it debt rating this in turn could adversely affect the liquidity of our investment substantial portion of which are treasury and government security our client may default on their settlement obligation including for reason unrelated to payment card activity such mortgage matter adverse fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate could negatively affect the dollar value of our revenue and payment in foreign currency finally the stock market have recently demonstrated extreme volatility additional decline in stock price or significant instability could cause consumer spending to decline materially any of these development could have material adverse impact on our prospect growth revenue profitability and overall business table of content decline in non and cross border activity and in multi currency transaction could adversely affect our revenue and profitability we generate significant portion of our revenue from such transaction we generate significant amount of our revenue from cross border transaction our client pay fee in connection with cross border transaction some of those fee may differ if conversion from the merchant currency to the cardholder billing currency is required thus revenue from processing cross border transaction for our client fluctuates with cross border travel and the need for transaction to be converted into different currency cross border travel may be adversely affected by world geopolitical economic and other condition these include the threat of terrorism natural disaster the effect of climate change and outbreak of disease decline in cross border travel could adversely affect our revenue and profitability decline in the need for conversion of currency might also adversely affect our revenue and profitability moreover if our client decide to increase cardholder fee associated with cross border transaction there could be decline in cardholder spending since our value proposition to the consumer could be reduced in addition visa derives revenue from foreign currency exchange activity that result from our client settlement in different currency reduction in or other change to multi currency transaction could decrease the need for or otherwise affect foreign currency exchange activity and adversely affect our revenue limitation or change in our ability to set foreign currency exchange rate for multi currency transaction result of regulation litigation competitive pressure or other reason may also adversely affect our revenue transaction outside the united state represent an increasingly important part of our strategy if we do not maintain consistency in the type of product we provide the quality of our service and the viability of our brand we will be unable to continue to grow in those area finally because we are domiciled in the united state negative perception of the united state arising from it political or other position could harm the perception of our company and our brand any of these factor could materially and adversely affect our revenue operating result prospect for future growth and overall business we risk loss or insolvency if our client fail to fund settlement obligation we have guaranteed we indemnify issuer and acquirer for any settlement loss they suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to fund it daily settlement obligation in certain instance we may indemnify issuer or acquirer even in situation in which transaction is not processed by our system this indemnification creates settlement risk for due to the difference in timing between the date of payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement the term and amount of our indemnification obligation are unlimited concurrent settlement failure involving more than one of our largest client or several of our smaller client may exceed our available financial resource could systemic operational failure lasting more than single day any such failure could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation in addition even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover settlement failure we may be unable to recover the amount of such payment this could expose to significant loss materially and adversely affecting our financial condition result of operation and cash flow some of our client are composed of group of financial institution some of these client have elected to limit their responsibility for settlement loss arising from the failure of their constituent financial institution in exchange for managing their constituent financial institution in accordance with table of content our credit risk policy to the extent that any settlement failure resulting from constituent financial institution exceeds the limit established by our credit risk policy we would have to absorb the cost of such settlement failure which could materially and adversely affect our cash flow and potentially our result of operation if our transaction processing system are disrupted or we can not process transaction efficiently the perception of our brand and our revenue or operating result could be materially and adversely affected our transaction processing system may experience service interruption or degradation because of processing or other technology malfunction fire natural disaster power loss disruption in long distance or local telecommunication access fraud terrorism climate change or accident our visibility in the global payment industry may attract terrorist and hacker to conduct physical or computer based attack leading to an interruption in service increased cost or the compromise of data security if such attack are not detected immediately their effect could be compounded although we maintain business continuity program and an information security program to address these risk we can not be sure that they will be effective additionally we rely on service provider for the timely transmission of information across our global data network if service provider fails to provide the communication capacity or service we require because of natural disaster operational disruption terrorism or any other reason the failure could interrupt our service because of the centrality of our processing system to our business any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of our brand reliability and materially reduce our revenue or profitability if we can not keep pace with rapid technological development to provide new and innovative payment program and service the use of our card could decline reducing our revenue and net income rapid significant technological change are confronting the payment industry these include development in smart card ecommerce mcommerce and radio frequency and proximity payment device such contactless card we can not predict the effect of technological change on our business we rely in part on third party including some of our competitor and potential competitor for the development of and access to new technology we expect that new service and technology applicable to the payment industry will continue to emerge these new service and technology may be superior to or render obsolete the technology we currently use in our card product and service in addition our ability to adopt new service and technology that we develop may be inhibited by industry wide standard by resistance to change from client or merchant or by third party intellectual property right our success will depend in part on our ability to develop new technology and adapt to technological change and evolving industry standard account data breach involving card data stored processed or transmitted could adversely affect our reputation and revenue our client merchant others and we store process and transmit cardholder account information in connection with our payment card in addition our client may use third party processor to process transaction generated by card carrying our brand breach of the system storing processing or transmitting sensitive cardholder data and account information could lead to fraudulent activity involving visa branded card to reputational damage and to claim against if we are sued in connection with any material data security breach we could be involved in protracted litigation if unsuccessful in defending such lawsuit we may have to pay damage or change our business practice or pricing structure any of which could have material adverse effect on our revenue and table of content profitability in addition any reputational damage resulting from an account data breach could decrease the use and acceptance of our card which could have material adverse effect on our payment volume revenue and future growth prospect finally any data security breach could result in additional regulation which could materially increase our cost an increase in fraudulent and other illegal activity involving our card could lead to reputational damage to our brand and reduce the use and acceptance of our card criminal are using increasingly sophisticated method to capture cardholder account information they use the information to conduct fraudulent transaction outsourcing and specialization of function within the payment system are increasing result more third party are involved in processing transaction using our card rise in fraud level involving our card or in misconduct by third party processing transaction using our card could lead to reputational damage to our brand this could reduce the use and acceptance of our card or lead to greater regulation which could increase our compliance cost failure to maintain interoperability between visa inc and visa europe authorization and clearing and settlement system could damage the business and global perception of the visa brand before our reorganization in october visa europe and we shared authorization clearing and settlement system visa europe completed and substantially deployed it own system in the fiscal year result visa europe and we will have to ensure that the two system can process every transaction involving both of our territory regardless of where it originates visa europe newly independent system operation could present challenge to our business due to the heightened difficulty of maintaining the interoperability of our respective system they diverge over time failure to authorize or clear and settle inter territory transaction quickly and accurately could impair the global perception of the visa brand risk related to our structure and organization we have little ability to control visa europe operation and limited recourse if it breach it obligation to visa europe ha very broad right to operate the visa business in it region under the agreement that governs our relationship if we want to change global rule or require visa europe to implement certain change that would not have positive return for visa europe and it member visa europe is not required to implement that rule or change unless we agree to pay for the implementation cost and expense that visa europe and it member will incur consequence of the implementation if visa europe fails to meet it obligation our remedy under this agreement are limited we can not terminate the agreement even upon visa europe material uncured breach although we have call right to acquire visa europe we can exercise that right under only extremely limited circumstance these and other feature of the license granted under the agreement may also raise issue concerning the characterization of the license for purpose of tax treatment of entry into the license and payment received thereunder in some instance in the case of cybersource and playspan visa europe may have the right to control the activity of newly acquired entity within visa europe territory in any event visa table of content europe exclusive license right in europe may hinder our ability to acquire new entity or to operate them effectively any inconsistency in the payment processing service and product that we can provide could negatively affect cardholder from visa europe using card in the country we serve or our cardholder using card in visa europe region if visa europe make acquire all of it outstanding stock we will incur substantial cost and may suffer material and adverse effect on our operation and net income we have granted visa europe put option requiring to purchase all outstanding capital stock from it member if exercised we will incur financial obligation of several billion dollar or more if visa europe exercise this option visa europe may do so at any time we may need to obtain third party financing in order to meet our obligation by either borrowing fund or selling stock an equity offering or the payment of part of the exercise price in our stock would dilute the ownership interest of our stockholder we would have only day to pay the exercise price sufficient financing might not be available to within that time on reasonable term see note visa europe to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report if visa europe exercise the put option we may encounter difficulty in integrating visa europe business and system into our existing operation if we can not do so quickly and cost effectively the integration could divert the time and attention of senior management disrupt our current operation and adversely affect our result of operation in addition we would become subject to the many regulation of the european union that govern the operation of visa europe including any regulatory dispute we are required to record quarterly any change in the fair value of the put option we record these adjustment through our consolidated statement of operation consequently the adjustment affect our reported net income and earnings per share these quarterly adjustment and their resulting impact on our reported statement of operation could be significant the existence of these change could adversely affect our ability to raise capital or the cost involved in raising it if we can not remain organizationally effective we will be unable to address the opportunity and challenge presented by our strategy and by the increasingly challenging competitive economic and regulatory environment since our reorganization in october we have increasingly centralized our management and operation for to succeed we must effectively integrate our operation actively work to ensure consistency throughout our organization and incorporate global perspective into our decision and process if we fail to do so we may be unable to expand rapidly we plan and the result of our expansion may be unsatisfactory in addition the current competitive economic and regulatory environment will require our organization to adapt rapidly and nimbly to new opportunity and challenge we may not be able to do so if we do not make important decision quickly enough define our appetite for risk specifically enough execute our strategy seamlessly enough implement new governance managerial and organizational process efficiently enough and communicate role and responsibility clearly enough we may be unable to attract and retain key management and other key employee our employee particularly our key management are vital to our success and difficult to replace we may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employee particularly if we do not offer employment term competitive with the rest of the market failure to attract and retain highly qualified employee or failure to develop and implement viable succession plan could result in table of content inadequate depth of institutional knowledge or skill set adversely affecting our business our chief executive officer contract terminates in march and we can not assure that there will be an effective transition

make strategic acquisition or investment in complementary business product or technology we may be unable to successfully finance partner with or integrate them the integration of cybersource playspan and fundamo all acquired recently will take time and resource that would otherwise have been available for other acquisition we will be subject to the term of the exclusive license granted to visa europe in most acquisition and major investment that involve country in the visa europe territory regulatory constraint particularly competition regulation may affect the extent to which we can maximize the value of acquisition or investment furthermore the integration of any acquisition or investment may divert management time and resource from our core business and disrupt our operation we may spend time and money on project that do not increase our revenue moreover our cash reserve contract to the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition or investment in cash although we periodically evaluate potential acquisition of and investment in business product and technology and anticipate continuing to make these evaluation we can not guarantee that we will be able to execute and integrate any such acquisition and investment with the evolution of technology and the opening of new market segment we may choose to participate in area in which we have not engaged in the past either through acquisition or through organic development relative inexperience in such business requires additional resource and present an additional degree of risk which could materially and adversely affect our operation and result future sale of our class common stock or the expiration or waiver of transfer restriction on our class stock could result in dilution to holder of share of our existing class common stock adversely affecting their right and depressing the market price of our class common stock the market price and voting power of our class common stock could decline

consolidated financial statement and related note included in item overview visa is global payment technology company that connects consumer business bank and government around the world enabling them to use digital currency instead of check and cash we provide our client with payment processing platform that encompass consumer credit debit prepaid and commercial payment we facilitate global commerce through the transfer of value and information among financial institution merchant consumer business and government entity each of these constituency ha played key role in the ongoing worldwide migration from paper based to electronic form of payment and we believe that this transformation continues to yield significant growth opportunity particularly outside the united state we continue to explore additional opportunity to enhance our competitive position by expanding the scope of payment service to benefit our existing client and to position visa to serve more and different constituency overall economic condition and regulatory environment our business is affected by overall economic condition and consumer spending our business performance during the year ended september reflects the impact of modest global economic recovery the reform act of october in accordance with the reform act the federal reserve capped the maximum debit interchange reimbursement fee assessed for card issued by large financial institution at twenty one cent plus five basis point before applying an interim fraud adjustment up to an additional one cent this amounted to significant reduction from the average system wide fee charged previously the federal reserve ha also promulgated regulation requiring issuer to make at least two unaffiliated network available for processing debit transaction on each debit card the rule also prohibit and issuer from restricting merchant ability to direct the routing of electronic debit transaction over any of the network that an issuer ha enabled to process those transaction we expect the interchange and exclusivity regulation well the routing regulation to have an adverse impact on our pricing reduce the number and volume of debit payment we process and decrease associated revenue number of our client may seek fee reduction or increased incentive from to offset their own lost revenue some have announced that they may reduce the number of debit card they issue and reduce investment they make in marketing and reward program some may impose new or higher fee on debit card or demand deposit account relationship some may elect to issue fewer card enabled with visa affiliated network we expect many merchant to use the routing regulation to redirect transaction or steer cardholder to other network based on lowest cost or other factor we expect operating revenue to grow in the high single to low double digit range for the full fiscal year and the pace of our revenue growth to begin regaining momentum in fiscal because we may have to re examine and possibly renegotiate certain of our contract to ensure that their term comply with new regulation these and other client will have the opportunity to seek to renegotiate term relating to fee incentive and routing in some case we may lose placement completely on issuer debit card we believe that we will be able to mitigate the negative impact from the reform act to some extent through pricing modification and working with our client and other business partner to win table of content merchant preference to route transaction over our network our broad platform of payment product continues to provide substantial value to both merchant and consumer we believe that the continuing worldwide secular shift to digital currency may help buffer the impact of the reform act reflected in our overall payment volume growth particularly outside the united state leader in the debit industry we continue to develop and refine our competitive business model to adapt to the reform act while mitigating some of the negative impact the reform act would have on our current business model we remain committed and prepared to adapt to and to compete effectively under this new debit regulatory environment share repurchase we effectively repurchased million share at an average price of per share for total cost of billion during the year ended september of the billion billion wa executed through the repurchase of class common stock in the open market and billion wa effectively executed through deposit into the litigation escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan adjusted financial result during the third quarter of fiscal and fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded decrease of million and million respectively in the fair value of the visa europe put option which resulted in the recognition of non cash non operating other income in our financial result these amount are not subject to income tax and therefore have no impact on our reported income tax provision the following table present our adjusted financial result for fiscal and excluding the impact of this revaluation fiscal year endedseptember fiscal year endedseptember in million except per share data net income attributable to visa inc reported revaluation of visa europe put option adjusted net income attributable to visa inc weighted average number of diluted share outstanding reported adjusted diluted earnings per share diluted earnings per share reported impact of the revaluation of visa europe put option we believe the presentation of adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share provides clearer understanding of our operating performance for the period the reduction in the fair value of the put option in each fiscal year wa primarily the result of decline in our estimated long term price to earnings ratio compared to the estimated ratio applicable to visa europe and doe not reflect any change in the likelihood that visa europe will exercise it option we therefore believe that the resulting non operating income recorded is not indicative of visa performance in these year or future period fundamo acquisition on june we acquired fundamo leading platform provider of mobile financial service for mobile network operator and financial institution in developing economy for million the acquisition wa made to accelerate the execution of visa global strategy to provide the next generation of payment solution and to provide long term growth opportunity to connect unbanked or under banked consumer to each other and to the

underlying business driver nominal payment volume processed transaction and cross border payment volume operating revenue also benefited from pricing modification made on various service well the inclusion of activity from newly acquired entity the benefit of pricing modification are partially offset by increase to client incentive part of our strategy to mitigate the impact of the reform act the new debit regulation will likely moderate the pace of our operating revenue growth in the primarily within service and data processing revenue through fiscal we expect operating revenue to grow in the high single to low double digit range for the full fiscal year we further expect that the pace of our revenue growth will begin regaining momentum in fiscal our operating revenue primarily service

the forward month period or the adjusted sustainable income defined in the option agreement the calculation of visa europe adjusted sustainable income under the term of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustment for cost synergy and other negotiated item upon exercise the key input to this formula including visa europe adjusted sustainable income will be the result of

fair value of the put option liability to be approximately million while this amount represents the fair value of the put option at september it doe not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised the purchase price we could be obligated to pay day after exercise will represent substantial financial obligation which could be several billion dollar

our consolidated financial statement we have established policy and control procedure which seek to ensure that estimate and assumption are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period however actual result could differ from our assumption and estimate and such difference could be material we believe that the following accounting estimate are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial result they require our most subjective or complex management judgment resulting from the need to make estimate about the effect of matter that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable revenue recognition client incentive critical estimate we enter into incentive agreement with select client and other business partner designed to build payment volume increase product acceptance and win merchant preference to route transaction over our network these incentive are primarily accounted for reduction to operating revenue or operating expense if separate identifiable benefit can be established we generally capitalize certain incentive payment under these agreement if certain criterion are met the capitalization criterion include the existence of future economic benefit to visa the existence of legally enforceable recoverability clause such early termination clause management ability and intent to enforce the recoverability clause and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amount deferred incentive are accrued systematically and rationally based on management estimate of each client performance these accrual are regularly reviewed and estimate of performance are adjusted appropriate capitalized amount are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the period of future economic benefit table of content assumption and judgment estimation of client incentive relies on forecast of payment volume card issuance and card conversion performance is estimated using customer reported information transactional information accumulated from our system historical information and discussion with our client impact if actual result differ from assumption if our client actual performance or recoverable cash flow are not consistent with our estimate client incentive may be materially different than initially recorded increase in incentive payment are generally driven by increased payment and transaction volume which drive our net revenue result in the event incentive payment exceed estimate such payment are not expected to have material effect on our financial condition result of operation or cash flow the cumulative impact of revision in estimate is recorded in the period such revision become probable and estimable for the year ended september client incentive represented of gross operating revenue fair value visa europe put option critical estimate we have granted visa europe perpetual put option which if exercised will require to purchase all of

month period or the adjusted sustainable income defined in the option agreement the calculation of visa europe adjusted sustainable income under the term of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustment for cost synergy and other negotiated item upon exercise the key input to this formula including visa europe adjusted sustainable income will be the result of negotiation between and visa europe the put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two party are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price see note visa europe to our consolidated financial statement for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the agreement the fair value of visa europe option wa estimated to be approximately million at september while the put option is in fact non transferable this amount recorded in our financial statement represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay third party market participant to transfer the potential obligation in an orderly transaction the fair value of the put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price under the term of the put agreement to the estimated fair value of visa europe the fair value of visa europe is defined the estimated amount third party market participant might pay in an arm length transaction under normal business condition probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that visa europe will never exercise it option while this amount represents the fair value of the put option at september it doe not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised which could be several billion dollar or more see the liquidity and capital resource section of management discussion and analysis for further discussion assumption and judgment the most significant estimate used in the valuation of the fair value of the put option are the assumed probability that visa europe will elect to exercise it option and the estimated differential between the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock defined in the put option agreement and that applicable to visa europe on stand alone basis at the time of exercise which we refer to the differential table of content probability of exercise exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of visa europe on behalf of the visa europe shareholder pursuant to authority granted to visa europe under it article of association we estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including but not limited to visa europe stated intention ii indication that visa europe is preparing to exercise reflected in it reported financial result iii evaluation of market condition including the regulatory environment that could impact the potential future profitability of visa europe and iv qualitative factor applicable to visa europe largest member which could indicate change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holding differential the differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock defined in the put option agreement and that applicable to visa europe at the time of exercise for valuation purpose the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measure and qualitative factor quantitatively we estimate our ratio by dividing the average stock price over the preceding month the long term calculation and the last trading date the day calculation prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the month starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date this median earnings estimate is obtained from the institutional broker estimate system we then determine the best estimate of our long term price to earnings multiple for valuation purpose by qualitatively evaluating the day calculation compared to the long term calculation in this evaluation we examine both measure to determine whether difference if any are the result of fundamental change in our long term value or the result of short term market volatility or other non company specific market factor that may not be indicative of our long term forward we believe given the perpetual nature of the put option that market participant would more heavily weight long term value indicator opposed to short term indicator factor that might indicate fundamental change in long term value include but are not limited to change in the regulatory environment client portfolio long term growth rate or new product innovation consistent methodology is applied to group of comparable public company used to estimate the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to visa europe these estimate therefore are impacted by change in stock price and the financial market expectation of our future earnings and those of the comparable company other estimate of lesser significance applied include growth rate and foreign currency exchange rate applied in the calculation of visa europe adjusted sustainable income the valuation model assumes large range of annual growth rate reflecting the different economic environment and circumstance under which visa europe could decide to exercise the lowest growth rate assumed reflect visa europe current business model an association owned by it member bank while the highest reflect successful shift to for profit model in anticipation of exercise the scenario with higher growth rate are assigned significantly higher probability in the valuation model we believe market participant would more heavily weight these scenario it is likely that should it choose to exercise it option visa europe will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting for profit business model in advance of exercising the put option the foreign exchange rate used to translate visa europe result from euro to dollar reflects blend of forward exchange rate observed in the marketplace the assumed timing of exercise of the put option used in the various modeled scenario is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation obligation calculated in later year are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value impact if actual result differ from assumption in the determination of the fair value of the put option at september we have assumed probability of exercise by visa europe at some point in the future and an estimated long term differential at the time of exercise of approximately the use of probability of exercise that is higher than our estimate would have table of content resulted in an increase of approximately million in the value of the put option an increase of in the assumed differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in the value of the put option the put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of visa europe such the put option liability is included in accrued liability on our consolidated balance sheet at september classification in current liability is not an indication of management expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within month fair value goodwill and intangible asset critical estimate we are required to estimate the fair value and useful life of asset acquired and liability assumed including intangible asset in business combination the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the asset acquired and liability assumed is goodwill we are subsequently required to ass asset acquired and goodwill for impairment assumption and judgment judgment used in the valuation of asset and liability assumed in business combination including goodwill and intangible asset can include the cash flow that an asset is expected to generate the weighted average cost of capital and discount rate determined by management we believe that the assumption made are comparable to those that market participant would use in making estimate of fair value determining the expected life of an intangible asset requires management judgment and is based on the evaluation of various factor including the competitive environment market share customer history and macroeconomic situation we determined that our visa brand customer relationship and visa europe franchise right are intangible asset with indefinite life based on our significant market share history of strong revenue and cash flow performance and historical retention rate result of acquiring fundamo in june playspan in march and cybersource in july respectively we acquired intangible asset comprising customer relationship tradenames and reseller relationship which we determined have finite useful life ranging primarily from to year see note acquisition and note intangible asset net to our consolidated financial statement our asset acquired liability assumed and related goodwill are assigned to respective reporting unit and goodwill impairment is assessed at the reporting unit level indefinite lived intangible asset annually or whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that impairment may exist we test each category of indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment on an aggregate basis which may require the allocation of cash flow and or an estimate of fair value to those asset or asset group impairment exists if the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is le than the carrying value we rely on number of factor when completing impairment assessment including review of discounted future cash flow business plan and use of present value technique of february our annual impairment review date we evaluated our indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment and concluded there wa no impairment of that date no recent event or change in circumstance indicate that impairment may exist thereafter reflected by the overall performance of our business and market capitalization finite lived intangible asset we evaluate the recoverability of finite lived intangible asset for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable if the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flow is le than the carrying amount of an asset or asset group an impairment loss is recognized the loss is measured the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds it fair value no recent event or change in circumstance indicate that finite lived intangible asset were impaired of september goodwill review of goodwill impairment is completed annually or whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that impairment may exist goodwill impairment is reviewed using two step table of content process the first step compare the fair value of the reporting unit to it carrying value if the fair value exceeds the carrying value no impairment exists and the second step is not performed if the fair value is le than the carrying value the second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill we allocate goodwill to reporting unit based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition we rely on number of factor when completing impairment assessment including review of discounted future cash flow business plan and use of present value technique we evaluated our goodwill for impairment on february our annual impairment review date and concluded there wa no impairment of that date subsequent to this annual assessment we acquired fundamo and playspan which resulted in additional goodwill no recent event or change in circumstance indicate that impairment exists reflected by the business performance of our reporting unit and overall market capitalization of september impact if actual result differ from assumption if actual result are not consistent with our assumption and estimate we may be exposed to impairment charge the carrying value of goodwill and intangible asset net were billion and billion respectively including billion of indefinite lived intangible asset and million of finite lived intangible asset net at september legal and regulatory matter critical estimate we are currently involved in various legal proceeding the outcome of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged period of time management is required to ass the probability of loss and amount of such loss if any in preparing our financial statement assumption and judgment we evaluate the likelihood of potential loss from legal or regulatory proceeding to which we are party we record liability for such claim when loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgment are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceeding the merit of our defense and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claim and may revise our estimate our retrospective responsibility plan only address monetary liability from settlement of or final judgment in the covered litigation the plan mechanism include the use of the litigation escrow account the accrual related to covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance we did not record an additional accrual for covered litigation during fiscal see note retrospective responsibility plan to our consolidated financial statement impact if actual result differ from assumption due to the inherent uncertainty of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdiction in which we operate our judgment may be materially different than the actual outcome which could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation see note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement income tax critical estimate in calculating our effective tax rate we make judgment regarding certain tax position including the timing and amount of deduction and allocation of income among various tax jurisdiction assumption and judgment we have various tax filing position with regard to the timing and amount of deduction and credit the establishment of liability for uncertain tax position and the table of content allocation of income among various tax jurisdiction we are also required to inventory evaluate and measure all uncertain tax position taken or to be taken on tax return and to record liability for the amount of such position that may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority impact if actual result differ from assumption although we believe that our estimate and judgment are reasonable actual result may differ from these estimate some or all of these judgment are subject to review by the taxing authority including our current and deferred tax benefit associated with the settlement of the american express litigation and the discover litigation and other matter see note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement if one or more of the taxing authority were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded and we were unable to realize this benefit it could have material and adverse effect on our financial result and cash flow quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse change in market factor our exposure to financial market risk result primarily from fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate interest rate and equity price cash and cash equivalent are not considered to be subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short period of time to maturity aggregate risk exposure are monitored on an ongoing basis we do not hold or enter into derivative or other financial instrument for trading or speculative purpose foreign currency exchange rate risk although most of our activity are transacted in dollar we are exposed to adverse fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation are primarily related to adverse change in the dollar value of revenue generated from foreign currency denominated transaction and adverse change in the dollar value of payment in foreign currency primarily for expense at our non location we manage these risk by entering into foreign currency forward contract with cash flow hedge accounting designation that hedge exposure of the variability in the dollar equivalent of anticipated non dollar denominated cash flow our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces but doe not entirely eliminate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movement we utilize rolling hedge strategy program to reduce the exchange rate risk from forecasted net exposure of revenue derived from and payment made in foreign currency during the following month the aggregate notional amount of our foreign currency forward contract outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program wa million and million at september and respectively the aggregate notional amount of million outstanding at september is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below predetermined and approved threshold however actual result for this period could materially differ from our forecast the effect of hypothetical change of the dollar is estimated to create an additional fair value gain or loss of approximately million on our foreign currency forward contract outstanding at september see note derivative financial instrument to our consolidated financial statement we are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activity this risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with client relative to the timing of market trade for balancing currency position risk in settlement activity is limited through daily operating procedure including the utilization of visa settlement system and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties table of content interest rate risk our investment portfolio asset are held in both fixed rate and adjustable rate security these asset are included in cash equivalent short term available for sale investment and long term available for sale investment investment in fixed rate instrument carry degree of interest rate risk the fair value of fixed rate security may be adversely impacted due to rise in interest rate additionally falling rate environment creates reinvestment risk because security mature the proceeds are reinvested at lower rate generating le interest income historically we have been able to hold investment maturity our operating result or cash flow have not been and are not expected to be materially impacted by sudden change in market interest rate the fair value balance of our fixed rate investment security at september and were billion and million respectively hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in interest rate would not have material impact on our investment portfolio at september the fair value balance of our adjustable rate debt security were million and million at september and respectively equity price risk visa europe put option we have liability related to the put option with visa europe which is recorded at fair market value at september we are required to record any change in the fair value of the put option on quarterly basis in the determination of the fair value of the put option at september we have assumed probability of exercise by visa europe at some point in the future and differential at the time of exercise of approximately the use of probability of exercise higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in the value of the put option an increase of in the assumed differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in the value of the put option see liquidity and capital resource and critical accounting estimate above pension plan our defined benefit pension plan asset were million and million and projected benefit obligation were million and million at september and respectively material adverse decline in the value of pension plan asset and or the discount rate for benefit obligation would result in decrease in the funded status of the plan an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding we will continue to monitor the performance of pension plan asset and market condition we evaluate the amount of our contribution to the plan for fiscal which we expect to make in september item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk quantitative
