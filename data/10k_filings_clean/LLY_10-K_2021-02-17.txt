and product emphasis in various country to meet local customer need and comply with local regulation we promote our major product in the through sale representative who call upon physician and other health care professional we also promote to healthcare provider in medical journal and online health care channel distribute literature and sample of certain product to physician and exhibit at medical meeting in addition we advertise certain product directly to consumer in the and we maintain website with information about our major product we supplement our employee sale force with contract sale organization to leverage our resource and reach additional patient in need we maintain special business group to service wholesaler pharmacy benefit manager managed care organization group purchasing organization government and long term care institution hospital and certain retail pharmacy we enter into arrangement with organization providing for discount or rebate on our product the most of our product are distributed through wholesaler that serve pharmacy physician and other health care professional and hospital in and three wholesale distributor in the mckesson corporation amerisourcebergen corporation and cardinal health inc each accounted for percent and percent of our consolidated revenue no other customer accounted for percent of our consolidated revenue in any of these year outside the outside the we promote our product to healthcare provider primarily through sale representative and online health care channel the product we market vary from country to country diabetes product constitute the largest single group of our consolidated revenue distribution pattern for our product also vary from country to country in most country in which we operate we maintain our own sale organization but in some smaller country we market our product through independent distributor marketing collaborationscertain of our product are marketed in arrangement with other pharmaceutical company for example we and boehringer ingelheim have global agreement to develop and commercialize portfolio of diabetes product including trajenta jentadueto jardiance glyxambi synjardy trijardy xr and basaglar for additional information see item financial statement and supplementary data note collaboration and other arrangement competitionour product compete globally with many other pharmaceutical product in highly competitive market important competitive factor include effectiveness safety and ease of use formulary placement price and demonstrated cost effectiveness marketing effectiveness and research and development of new product process modality and us most new product that we introduce must compete with other branded or generic product already on the market or product that are later developed by competitor competitor introduce new product or delivery system with therapeutic or cost advantage including by developing new modality our product become subject to decreased sale progressive price reduction or both we believe our long term competitive success depends on discovering and developing either alone or in collaboration with others or acquiring innovative cost effective product that provide improved outcome for patient and deliver value to payer and continuously improving the productivity of our operation in highly competitive environment can be no assurance that our effort will result in commercially successful product and it is possible that our product will be or will become uncompetitive from time to time result of product developed by our competitor generic pharmaceuticalsone of the biggest competitive challenge we face is from generic pharmaceutical in the and europe the regulatory approval process for pharmaceutical other than biological product biologics exempts generic from costly and time consuming clinical trial to demonstrate their safety and efficacy allowing generic manufacturer to rely on the safety and efficacy of the innovator product result generic manufacturer generally invest far fewer resource than we do in research and development and can price their product significantly lower than our branded product accordingly when branded non biologic pharmaceutical loses it market exclusivity it normally face intense price competition from generic form of the product which can cause to lose significant portion of the product revenue in short period of time public and private payer typically encourage the use of generic alternative to brand name drug in their healthcare program law in the generally allow and in many case require pharmacist to substitute generic drug that have been rated under government procedure to be essentially equivalent to brand name drug where substitution is mandatory it must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it in many country outside the intellectual property protection is weak and we must compete with generic or counterfeit version of our product of our product and approximately half of the potential new medicine in our clinical stage pipeline are biologics in the the food and drug administration fda regulates biologics under the federal food drug and cosmetic act the public health service act and implementing regulation competition for lilly biologics may be affected by the approval of follow on biologics also known biosimilars biosimilar is subsequent version of an approved innovator biologic that due to it analytical and clinical similarity to the innovator biologic may be approved based on an abbreviated data package that relies in part on the full testing required of the innovator biologic approval by the fda ultimately depends on many factor including showing that the biosimilar is highly similar to the original product and ha no clinically meaningful difference from the original product in term of safety purity and potency globally most government have developed abbreviated regulatory pathway to approve biosimilars follow ons to innovator developed biologics including the biologics price competition and innovation act of the bpcia in the and number of biosimilars have been licensed under the bpcia and in europe the patent and regulatory exclusivity for the existing innovator biologic generally must expire in given market biosimilars may enter that market however in the the product exclusivity period under the bpcia could be affected by recent government proposal and litigation see patent trademark and other intellectual property right in addition the extent to which biosimilar approved will be substituted for the innovator biologic in way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non biologic product is not yet entirely clear and will depend on number of regulatory and marketplace factor that are still developing in the currently only biosimilar product that is determined to be interchangeable will be considered substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the original biologic product to prove that biosimilar product is interchangeable the applicant must demonstrate that the product can be expected to produce the clinical result the original biologic product in any given patient and if the product is administered more than once in patient that safety risk and potential for diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the interchangeable biosimilar biologic product and the original biologic product is no greater than the risk of using the original biologic product without switching biosimilars may present both competitive challenge and opportunity for example competitor company ha developed version of insulin lispro that competes with our product humalog on the other hand in collaboration with boehringer ingelheim we developed basaglar new insulin glargine product which ha the same amino acid sequence product currently marketed by competitor and ha launched follow on biologic in the and biosimilar in europe and japan however in march the fda began regulating all of our insulin product biologics rather than drug based on fda draft guidance this change may lower the requirement for competitor biosimilar product to enter the market some of which could be designated interchangeable and therefore substituted for our insulin product at pharmacy such in june mylan announced that the fda approved it new drug application nda for semglee new insulin glargine product which it launched follow on biologic in the that competes with basaglar the law regulating biosimilars continue to be interpreted and implemented by the fda and remain subject to substantial uncertainty including with respect to their impact on our business private sector dynamicsin the private sector consolidation and integration among healthcare provider significantly affect the competitive marketplace for pharmaceutical health plan pharmacy benefit manager wholesaler and other supply chain stakeholder have been consolidating into fewer larger entity thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance private third party insurer well government typically maintain formulary that specify coverage the condition under which drug are included on plan formulary and reimbursement the associated of pocket cost to the consumer to control cost by negotiating discounted price in exchange for formulary inclusion placement can lead to reduced usage of drug for the relevant patient population due to coverage restriction such prior authorization and formulary exclusion or due to reimbursement limitation that result in higher consumer out of pocket cost such non preferred co pay tier increased co insurance level and higher deductible consequently pharmaceutical company compete for formulary placement not only on the basis of product attribute such efficacy safety profile or patient ease of use but also by providing rebate value based agreement where pricing is based on achievement or not of specified outcome are another tool that may be utilized between payer and pharmaceutical company formulary placement and pricing are negotiated price is an increasingly important factor in formulary decision particularly in treatment area in which the payer ha taken the position that multiple branded product are therapeutically comparable we expect these downward pricing pressure will continue to negatively affect our consolidated result of operation in addition to formulary placement change in insurance design continue to drive greater consumer cost sharing through high deductible plan and higher co insurance or co pay for additional information on pricing and reimbursement for our pharmaceutical product see regulation and private payer action affecting pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access patent trademark and other intellectual property rightsoverviewintellectual property protection is critical to our ability to successfully commercialize our life science innovation and invest in the search for new medicine we own have applied for or are licensed under large number of patent in the and many other country relating to product product us formulation and manufacturing process in addition discussed for some product we have effective intellectual property protection in the form of data protection under pharmaceutical regulatory law the patent protection anticipated to be of most relevance to pharmaceutical is provided by national patent claiming the active ingredient the compound patent particularly those in major market such the various european country and japan these patent may be issued based upon the filing of international patent application usually filed under the patent cooperation treaty pct patent application covering compound are generally filed during the discovery phase of the drug discovery process which is described in the research and development section below in general national patent in each relevant country are available for period of year from the filing date of the pct application which is often year prior to the launch of commercial product further patent term adjustment and restoration may extend the original patent term patent term adjustment is statutory right available to all patent applicant to provide relief in the event that patent grant is delayed during examination by the united state patent and trademark office uspto patent term restoration is statutory right provided to patent holder that claim invention subject to review by the fda to make for portion of the time invested in clinical trial and the fda review process single patent for pharmaceutical product may be eligible for patent term restoration patent term restoration is limited by formula and can not be calculated product approval due to uncertainty about the duration of clinical trial and the time it take the fda to review an application there is five year cap on any restoration and no patent expiration date may be extended beyond year from fda approval some country outside the also offer form of patent term restoration for example supplementary protection certificate are available to extend the life of european patent up to an additional five year subject to year cap from european medicine agency ema approval similarly in japan south korea and australia patent term can be extended up to five year depending on the length of regulatory review and other factor loss of effective patent protection for pharmaceutical especially for non biologic product typically result in the loss of effective market exclusivity for the product which often result in severe and rapid decline in revenue for the product however in some case the innovator company may retain exclusivity despite approval of the generic biosimilar or other follow on version of new medicine beyond the expiration of the compound patent through manufacturing trade secret later expiring patent on manufacturing process method of use or formulation or data protection that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory law change to the law and regulation governing these protection could result in earlier loss of effective market exclusivity the primary form of data protection are follows regulatory authority in major market generally grant data package protection for period of year following new drug approval in recognition of the substantial investment required to complete clinical trial data package protection prohibits other manufacturer from submitting regulatory application for marketing approval based on the innovator company regulatory submission data for the drug the base period of data package protection depends on the country for example the period is generally five year in the year for new biologics described below effectively year in europe and eight year in japan the period begin on the date of product approval and run concurrently with the patent term for any relevant patent under the bpcia the fda ha the authority to approve biosimilars competitor seeking approval of biosimilar must file an application to show it molecule is highly similar to an approved innovator biologic and include certain amount of safety and efficacy data that the fda will consider on case by case basis under the data protection provision of this law the fda can not approve biosimilar application until year after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic subject to certain condition the bpcia is part of the affordable care act the constitutionality of which is currently litigated in the the fda ha the authority to grant additional data protection for approved drug where the sponsor conduct specified testing in pediatric or adolescent population within specified time period if granted this pediatric exclusivity provides an additional six month of exclusivity which is added to the term of data protection well to the term of any relevant patent to the extent these protection have not already expired while the term of the pediatric exclusivity attache to the term of any relevant patent pediatric exclusivity is regulatory exclusivity bar to generic approval not patent right under the orphan drug law specific use of drug or biologic can receive orphan designation if it is intended to treat disease or condition affecting fewer than people in the or affecting more than people but not reasonably expected to recover it development and marketing cost through sale among other benefit orphan designation entitles the particular use of the drug to seven year of market exclusivity meaning that the fda can not with limited exception approve another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication until expiration of the seven year period unlike pediatric exclusivity the orphan exclusivity period is independent of and run in parallel with any applicable patent outside the major market the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for pharmaceutical varies widely and in number of these market we are unable to patent our product or to enforce the patent we receive for our product under the trade related aspect of intellectual property agreement trip administered by the world trade organization more than country have agreed to provide non discriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical invention and to assure that adequate and effective right are available to patent owner certain developing country limit protection for biopharmaceutical product under their interpretation of flexibility allowed under the agreement thus some type of patent such those on new us of compound or new form of molecule are not available in certain developing country further many developing country and some developed country do not provide effective data package protection even though it is specified in trip our intellectual property portfoliowe consider intellectual property protection for certain product process us and formulation particularly with respect to those product discussed below to be important to our operation in addition to the data protection and patent identified below we may hold patent on manufacturing process formulation device or us that extend exclusivity beyond the date shown below the most relevant patent protection or data protection and associated expiry date for our top selling or recently launched patent protected marketed product are follows alimta is protected by vitamin regimen patent plus pediatric exclusivity may see item financial statement and supplementary data note contingency for information regarding our settlement agreement with eagle pharmaceutical inc eagle and it impact

of our product name logo and unique product appearance the appearance of our trulicity autoinjector which we consider in the aggregate to be important to our operation trademark protection varies throughout the world with protection continuing in some country long the mark is used and in other country long it is registered registration are normally for fixed but renewable term trademark protection often extends beyond the patent and data protection for product license and collaborationsmost of our major product are not subject to significant license and collaboration agreement for information on our license and collaboration agreement including our agreement with incyte corporation related to olumiant see item financial statement and supplementary data note collaboration and other arrangement patent challenge in the the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of commonly known the hatch waxman act authorizes the fda to approve generic version of innovative pharmaceutical other than biologics which are discussed below in more detail when the generic manufacturer ha not conducted safety and efficacy study but file an abbreviated new drug application anda in an anda the generic manufacturer must demonstrate only bioequivalence between the generic version and the nda approved drug not safety and efficacy establishing bioequivalence is generally straightforward and inexpensive for the generic company absent patent challenge the fda can not approve an anda until after certain of the innovator patent expire however after the innovator ha marketed it product for four year generic manufacturer may file an anda alleging that one or more or all of the patent listed in the innovator nda are invalid or not infringed this allegation is commonly known paragraph iv certification if the innovator responds by filing suit the generic manufacturer the fda is prohibited from approving the generic company application for month period which can be shortened or extended by the trial court judge hearing the patent challenge if one or more of the nda listed patent are challenged the first filer of paragraph iv certification may be entitled to day period of market exclusivity over all other generic manufacturer generic manufacturer use paragraph iv certification extensively to challenge patent on innovative pharmaceutical in addition generic company have shown willingness to launch at risk after receiving anda approval but before final resolution of their patent challenge we are currently in hatch waxman litigation involving alimta with single generic manufacturer for more information on hatch waxman litigation involving the company see item financial statement and supplementary data note contingency under the bpcia the fda can not approve an application for biosimilar product until data protection expires year after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic and an application may not be submitted until four year following the date the innovator biologic wa first approved however the bpcia provide mechanism for competitor to challenge the validity of an innovator patent early four year after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic the patent litigation scheme under the bpcia and the bpcia is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the fda well court court have held that biosimilar applicant are not required to engage in the bpcia patent litigation scheme and patent holder retain the right to bring suit under normal patent law procedure if biosimilar applicant attempt to commercialize product prior to patent expiration further in the the increased likelihood of generic and biosimilar challenge to innovator intellectual property ha increased the risk of loss of innovator market exclusivity see also competition biosimilars in addition there is procedure in patent law known inter partes review ipr which allows any member of the public to file petition with the uspto seeking the review of any issued patent for validity iprs are conducted before administrative patent judge in the uspto using lower standard of proof than used in federal district court in addition the challenged patent are not accorded the presumption of validity are in federal district court generic drug company and even some investment firm have engaged in the ipr process in attempt to invalidate our patent outside the the legal doctrine and process by which pharmaceutical patent can be challenged vary widely in recent year we have experienced an increase in patent challenge from generic manufacturer in many country outside the for more information on administrative challenge and litigation involving our intellectual property right see item financial statement and supplementary data note contingency regulation of our operationsour operation are regulated extensively by numerous national state and local agency regulation of product the lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing data analysis manufacturing development and regulatory review necessary for governmental approval of our product is extremely costly and can significantly delay product introduction and revenue generation in addition our operation are subject to complex federal state local and foreign law and regulation concerning relationship with healthcare provider and supplier the environment occupational health and safety and data privacy compliance with the law and regulation affecting the manufacture and sale of current product and the discovery development and introduction of new product will continue to require substantial effort expense and capital investment of particular importance to our business is regulation by the fda in the pursuant to law and regulation that include the federal food drug and cosmetic act the fda ha jurisdiction over all of our product and device in the and administers requirement covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing quality control distribution labeling marketing promotion advertising dissemination of information and post marketing surveillance of those product following approval our product remain subject to regulation by various agency in connection with labeling import export storage recordkeeping advertising promotion and safety reporting we conduct extensive post marketing surveillance of the safety of the product we sell the fda may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirement and standard is not maintained or if problem occur after product reach the market the fda strictly regulates marketing labeling advertising and promotion of product that are placed on the market pharmaceutical product may be promoted only for the approved indication and in accordance with the provision of the approved label the fda and other agency actively enforce the law and regulation prohibiting the promotion of label us the fda extensively regulates all aspect of manufacturing quality for pharmaceutical under it current good manufacturing practice cgmp regulation outside the our product and operation are subject to similar regulatory requirement notably by the ema in europe and the ministry of health labor and welfare in japan specific regulatory requirement vary from country to country regulatory requirement and approval process outside the may differ from those in the and may involve additional cost and uncertainty we make substantial investment of capital and operating expense to implement comprehensive company wide quality system and control in our manufacturing product development and process development operation in an effort to ensure sustained compliance with cgmp and similar regulation however in the event we fail to adhere to these requirement we become subject to potential government investigation interruption in production fine and penalty delay in new product approval and reputational harm certain of our product are manufactured by third party and their failure to comply with these regulation could adversely affect through failure to supply product to or delay in new product approval any determination by the fda or other regulatory authority of manufacturing or other deficiency could adversely affect our business we are also subject to variety of federal state and local environmental health and safety and other law and regulation that may affect our research development or production effort use authorizationsthe secretary of health and human service may authorize unapproved medical product to be manufactured marketed and sold in the context of an actual or potential emergency that ha been designated by the government after an emergency ha been announced the secretary of health and human service may authorize euas for the use of specific product based on criterion established by statute including that the product at issue may be effective in diagnosing treating or preventing serious or life threatening disease when there are no adequate approved and available alternative an eua is subject to additional condition and restriction such the obligation to provide fact sheet for healthcare provider administering the product and those to whom it is administered adverse event monitoring and reporting and recordkeeping and reporting requirement by product manufacturer the fda may also establish additional discretionary condition of authorization that the fda deems necessary or appropriate to protect the public health including condition related to product distribution product administration and data collection and analysis concerning the safety and effectiveness of the product in issuing an eua the fda considers the totality of available scientific evidence regarding quality safety and efficacy including the known and potential risk of such product and the adequacy and availability of approved alternative among other factor an eua is not substitute for obtaining fda approval licensure or clearance for use of product an eua terminates when the emergency determination underlying the eua terminates and euas can be revoked under other circumstance the timing of which may occur unexpectedly or be difficult to predict outside the the emergency use of medical product is subject to regulatory process and requirement that differ from those in the the covid pandemic ha been designated national emergency in the on the basis of such determination the secretary of health and human service declared that circumstance exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of drug and biologics during the covid pandemic the fda ha granted euas for bamlanivimab bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together and baricitinib in combination with remdesivir and similar action have been taken by other regulator in certain jurisdiction outside the we intend to submit bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together to the fda for approval in the second half of other law and regulationsthe marketing promotional and pricing practice of pharmaceutical manufacturer well the manner in which manufacturer interact with purchaser prescribers and patient are subject to various other federal and state law well analogous foreign law and regulation including the federal anti kickback statute the false claim act and state law governing kickback false claim unfair trade practice and consumer protection these law are administered by among others the department of justice the office of inspector general of the department of health and human service the federal trade commission the office of personnel management and state attorney general over the past several year state and federal government have increased their oversight enforcement activity and intra agency coordination with respect to pharmaceutical company further several claim brought by these agency against and other company under these and other law have resulted in corporate criminal sanction and very substantial civil settlement in december the office of inspector general of the department of health and human service and the center for medicare medicaid service issued final rule expanding and modifying existing and adding new regulatory safe harbor and exception respectively under the anti kickback statute and the ethic in patient referral act we are currently evaluating the impact if any these regulatory amendment will have upon becoming effective on our consolidated result of operation liquidity and financial position which is uncertain at this time the foreign corrupt practice act of fcpa prohibits certain individual and entity including publicly traded company from promising offering or giving anything of value to foreign official with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage the fcpa also imposes specific recordkeeping and internal control requirement on publicly traded company noted above outside the our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign official additionally in many country outside the healthcare provider who prescribe pharmaceutical are employed by the government and purchaser of pharmaceutical are government entity therefore our interaction with these prescribers and purchaser are subject to regulation under the fcpa addition to the application and enforcement of the fcpa the various jurisdiction in which we operate and supply our product have law and regulation aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior in recent year several jurisdiction have enhanced their law and regulation in this area increased their enforcement activity and or increased the level of cross border coordination and information sharing we are and could in the future become subject to administrative and legal proceeding and action which could include claim for civil penalty including treble damage under the false claim act criminal sanction and administrative remedy including exclusion from federal and other health care program it is possible that an adverse outcome in future action could have material adverse impact on our consolidated result of operation liquidity and financial position we are also subject to variety of federal state and local environmental health and safety and other law and regulation that may affect our research development or production effort regulation and private payer action affecting pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access there continues to be considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and measure to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceutical are being considered at various level of state and federal government in addition government action to reduce federal spending on entitlement program including medicare and medicaid may affect payment for our product or service associated with the provision of our product additionally there ha been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturer set price for their marketed product which ha resulted in several congressional inquiry and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to among other thing bring more transparency to product pricing review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient program and reform government program reimbursement methodology for drug product the regulatory priority of the current presidential administration could further intensify these effort which could have material adverse impact on our business in the we are required to provide rebate to the federal government and respective state government on their purchase of our pharmaceutical under various federal and state healthcare program including state medicaid and medicaid managed care program minimum of percent plus adjustment for price increase over time and discount to private entity who treat patient in certain type of health care facility intended to serve low income and uninsured patient known facility no rebate are required at this time in the medicare part physician and hospital outpatient program where reimbursement is set on an average sale price plus percent formula additionally an annual fee is imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturer and importer that sell branded prescription drug to specified government program since the bipartisan budget act ha required manufacturer of brand name drug biologics and biosimilars to provide discount of percent of the cost of branded prescription drug for medicare part participant who are in the doughnut hole the coverage gap in medicare prescription drug coverage an increase from the previous percent discount rebate are also negotiated in the private sector we pay rebate to private payer who provide prescription drug benefit to senior covered by medicare and to private payer who provide prescription drug benefit to their customer these rebate are affected by the introduction of competitive product and generic in the same class our approach to the rebate we offer to private payer who provide prescription drug benefit to senior covered by medicare may be impacted by recent regulatory amendment included in the anti kickback statute final rule that will become effective on january the globally public and private payer are increasingly restricting access to pharmaceutical based on assessment of comparative effectiveness and value including through the establishment of formal health technology assessment process in addition third party organization including professional association academic institution and non profit entity associated with payer are conducting and publishing comparative effectiveness and cost benefit analysis on medicine the impact of which are uncertain at this time in most international market we operate in an environment of government mandated cost containment program which may include price control international reference pricing to other country price discount and rebate therapeutic reference pricing to other often generic pharmaceutical choice restriction on physician prescription level and mandatory generic substitution we may experience additional pricing pressure resulting from the financial strain of the covid pandemic on government funded healthcare system around the world we can not predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative regulatory or payer development however in general we expect to see continued focus on regulating pricing resulting in additional state federal and international legislative and regulatory development that could have further negative effect on pricing and reimbursement for our product see item management discussion and analysis result of operation executive overview other matter trend affecting pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access for additional information regarding recent legislative administrative and other pricing initiative and their impact on our result research and developmentour commitment to research and development date back more than year we invest heavily in research and development we believe it is critical to our long term competitiveness at the end of we employed approximately people in pharmaceutical research and development activity including substantial number of physician scientist holding graduate or postgraduate degree and highly skilled technical personnel our internal pharmaceutical research focus primarily on the area of diabetes oncology immunology neurodegeneration and pain during we also focused on researching and developing potential treatment for covid in addition to discovering and developing new medicine we seek to expand the value of existing product through new us formulation and therapeutic approach that provide additional value to patient to supplement our internal effort we collaborate with others including academic institution and research based pharmaceutical and biotechnology company we use the service of physician hospital medical school and other research organization worldwide to conduct clinical trial to establish the safety and effectiveness of our medicine we actively invest in external research and technology that we believe complement and strengthen our own effort these investment can take many form including among others licensing arrangement co development agreement co promotion arrangement joint venture acquisition and equity investment pharmaceutical development is time consuming expensive and risky very of the candidate discovered by researcher ultimately become approved medicine the process from discovery to regulatory approval can take over decade candidate can fail at any stage of the process and even late stage candidate sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval or achieve commercial success the following describes in more detail the research and development process for pharmaceutical product phase of new drug development discovery phasein the discovery phase scientist identify design and synthesize promising candidate by analyzing their effect on biological target thought to play role in disease target are often unproven and only candidate that have the desired effect on the target and meet other design criterion move to the next phase of development which includes the initiation of study in animal to support regulatory and safety requirement for clinical research in human the discovery phase can take year and the probability of any one candidate becoming medicine is extremely low early development phaseearly development includes initial testing for safety and efficacy and early analysis of manufacturing requirement safety testing is initially performed in laboratory test and animal necessary in general the first human test often referred to phase are conducted in small group of subject to ass safety and evaluate the potential dosing range subsequently larger population of patient are studied phase ii to identify initial sign of efficacy while continuing to ass safety in parallel scientist work to identify safe effective and economical manufacturing process long term animal study continue to test for potential safety issue of the candidate that enter the early development phase approximately percent move to the late development phase the early development phase varies but can take several year to complete late development phaselate phase development project typically phase iii have met initial safety requirement and shown initial evidence of efficacy in earlier study result these candidate generally have higher likelihood of success and trial include larger patient population to demonstrate safety and efficacy in the disease these study are designed to demonstrate the benefit and risk of the potential new medicine and may be compared to competitive therapy placebo or both phase iii study are generally conducted globally and are designed to support regulatory filing for marketing approval the duration of phase iii testing varies by disease and may take two to four year submission phaseonce potential new medicine is submitted to regulatory agency the time to final marketing approval can vary from several month to several year depending on the disease state the strength and complexity of available data the degree of unmet need and the time required for the regulatory agency to evaluate the submission which can depend on prioritization by regulator and other factor there is no guarantee that potential medicine will receive marketing approval or that decision on marketing approval or indication will be consistent across geographic area we believe our investment in research both internally and in collaboration with others have resulted in robust pipeline of potential new medicine and new treatment indication in all stage of development we currently have approximately candidate in clinical development or under regulatory review and larger number of project in the discovery phase see item management discussion and analysis result of operation executive overview late stage pipeline for more information on certain of our product candidate raw material and product supplymost of the principal material we use in our manufacturing operation are available from more than one source however we obtain certain raw or intermediate material primarily from only one source we generally seek to maintain sufficient inventory to supply the market until an alternative source of supply could be implemented in the event one of these supplier wa unable to provide the material or product however in the event of an extended failure of supplier or significant unanticipated increase in demand on supplier it is possible that we could experience an interruption in supply until we established new source or in some case implemented alternative process the majority of our revenue come from product produced in our own facility our principal active ingredient manufacturing occurs at site we own in the including puerto rico and ireland finishing operation including formulation filling assembling delivery device manufacturing and packaging take place at number of site throughout the world we utilize third party for certain active ingredient manufacturing and finishing operation manage our supply chain including our own facility contracted arrangement and inventory in way that is intended to allow to meet all expected product demand while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve efficiency and respond to change in supply and demand to maintain stable supply of our product we use variety of technique including comprehensive quality system inventory management and back up site however pharmaceutical production process are complex highly regulated and vary widely from product to product shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be very lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditure process modification and regulatory approval accordingly if we were to experience unplanned plant shutdown at one of our own facility significant failure of contract supplier or significant unanticipated increase in demand we could experience an interruption in supply of certain product or product shortage until production could be resumed or expanded in addition covid could also have an adverse impact on our manufacturing operation global supply chain and distribution system which could impact our ability to produce and distribute our product and affect the ability of third party on which we rely to fulfill their obligation to and could increase our expense for more information see item risk factor risk related to our business the covid pandemic and effort to reduce it spread have impacted and may in future period negatively impact our business and operation and item management discussion and analysis result of operation executive overview covid pandemic quality assuranceour success depends in great measure on customer confidence in the quality of our product and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and effectiveness product quality arises from total commitment to quality in all part of our operation including research and development purchasing facility planning manufacturing distribution and dissemination of information about our medicine quality of production process involves strict control of ingredient equipment facility manufacturing method packaging material and labeling we perform test at various stage of production process and on the final product in an effort to ensure that the product meet all applicable regulatory requirement and our internal standard these test may involve chemical and physical chemical analysis microbiological testing testing in

is lilly com leadership governance risk factorsin addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form the following risk factor should be considered carefully in evaluating our company it is possible that our business financial condition liquidity cash flow or result of operation could be materially adversely affected by any of these risk certain of these risk could also adversely affect the company reputation additional risk and uncertainty not presently known to or that we currently believe to be immaterial could also adversely affect our business and reputation risk related to our business the covid pandemic and effort to reduce it spread have impacted and may in future period negatively impact our business and operation the covid pandemic ha substantially burdened healthcare system worldwide the focus of resource on covid and widespread protective measure implemented to control the spread of the pandemic have impacted discovery research development manufacturing and sale of our medicine well those of the broader pharmaceutical industry significant delay or unexpected issue such higher discontinuation rate or delay accumulating data affecting the timing conduct or regulatory review of our clinical trial could adversely affect our ability to commercialize some asset in our product pipeline lack of normal access and fewer in person interaction by patient and our employee with the healthcare system along with concern about the continued supply of medication ha resulted and may continue to result in change in buying pattern throughout the supply chain impacting demand for our product and negatively impacting the consolidated operating result of our underlying business in certain location in the and around the world with covid outbreak we temporarily halted in person interaction by our employee with healthcare provider and increased virtual interaction while in person interaction have resumed in many location we may decide to halt such activity in the future and in those case expect to resume such interaction it is safe to do and in compliance with applicable guidance and requirement the covid pandemic could also have an adverse impact on our manufacturing operation global supply chain and distribution system which could impact our ability to produce and distribute our product and affect the ability of third party on which we rely to fulfill their obligation to and could increase our expense we also face unique risk and uncertainty related to our development manufacture and uptake of potential treatment for covid including vulnerability to supply chain disruption higher manufacturing cost difficulty in manufacturing sufficient quantity of our therapy restriction on administration that limit widespread and timely access to our therapy and risk related to handling return and or refund of product after delivery by expedited authorization process including our euas for bamlanivimab and bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together have allowed restricted distribution of product with le than typical safety and efficacy data and additional data that become available may call into question the safety or effectiveness of our covid therapy additionally the availability of superior or competitive therapy or preventative measure such vaccine coupled with the transient nature of pandemic could negatively impact or eliminate demand for our covid therapy in addition we may be required to accept return of certain product previously shipped pursuant to euas if the relevant eua is revoked or terminated mutation or the spread of other variant of the coronavirus could also render our therapy ineffective any of these risk could prevent from recouping our substantial investment in the research development and manufacture of our covid therapy in addition the condition created by the covid pandemic intensify other risk inherent in our business including among other thing risk related to drug pricing and access the conduct of clinical trial workplace safety and productivity intellectual property protection product liability and other litigation and the impact of adverse global and local economic condition have experienced negative impact to our underlying business including demand for our product due to the covid pandemic but the pandemic ha not negatively impacted our liquidity position given the evolving nature of the virus the financial impact of the covid pandemic on our result of operation financial condition liquidity and cash flow in future period could change perhaps materially the degree to which the covid pandemic affect will depend on development that are highly uncertain and beyond our knowledge or control including but not limited to the duration and severity of the pandemic the action taken to reduce it transmission including widespread availability of vaccine and the speed with which and extent to which more stable economic and operating condition resume should the covid pandemic and any associated recession or depression continue for prolonged period our result of operation financial condition liquidity and cash flow could be materially impacted by lower revenue and profitability and lower likelihood of effectively and efficiently developing and launching new medicine pharmaceutical research and development is very costly and highly uncertain we may not succeed in developing licensing or acquiring commercially successful product sufficient in number or value to replace revenue of product that have lost or will soon lose intellectual property protection or are displaced by competing product or therapy there are many difficulty and uncertainty inherent in pharmaceutical research and development the introduction of new product and business development activity to expand our product pipeline there is high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development to bring drug from the discovery phase to market can take over decade and often cost in excess of billion failure can occur at any point in the process including in later stage after substantial investment result most fund invested in research program will not generate financial return new product candidate that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concern inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approval or payer reimbursement or coverage limited scope of approved us change in the relevant treatment standard or the availability of new or better competitive product difficulty or excessive cost to manufacture or infringement of the patent or intellectual property right of others regulatory agency continue to establish high hurdle for the efficacy and safety of new product delay and uncertainty in drug approval process can result in delay in product launch and lost market opportunity in addition it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rate of new product we can not state with certainty when or whether our product under development will be approved or launched whether if initially granted such approval will be maintained whether we will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire additional product candidate or product or whether our product once launched will be commercially successful we must maintain continuous flow of successful new product and successful new indication or brand extension for existing product both through our internal effort and our business development activity sufficient both to cover our substantial research and development cost and to replace revenue that are lost profitable product lose intellectual property exclusivity or are displaced by competing product or therapy failure to do so in the short term or long term would have material adverse effect on our business result of operation cash flow and financial position our business development activity to enhance our product pipeline may include acquisition strategic alliance collaboration investment and licensing arrangement there are substantial risk associated with identifying business development target and consummating related transaction which may not be completed in timely manner if at all may not result in successful commercialization of any product and may give rise to legal proceeding or regulatory scrutiny see item management discussion and analysis result of operation executive overview late stage pipeline for more detail about our current product pipeline we depend on product with intellectual property protection for most of our revenue cash flow and earnings we have lost or will lose effective intellectual property protection for many of those product in the next few year which ha resulted and is likely to continue to result in rapid and severe decline in revenue number of our top selling product including alimta and forteo have recently lost or will lose in the next few year significant patent protection and or data protection in the well key country outside the we have faced and remain exposed to generic competition following the loss of such intellectual property protection in particular we expect that the entry of generic competition for alimta in the following the loss of patent exclusivity will cause rapid and severe decline in revenue for the product and have material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation and cash flow certain other significant product no longer have effective exclusivity through patent protection or data protection for non biologic product loss of exclusivity whether by expiration of legal right or by termination thereof consequence of litigation typically result in the entry of one or more generic competitor leading to rapid and severe decline in revenue especially in the historically outside the the market penetration of generic following loss of exclusivity ha not been rapid or pervasive in the however generic market penetration is increasing in many market outside the including japan europe and many country in emerging market for biologics such humalog humulin erbitux cyramza trulicity taltz and emgality loss of exclusivity may or may not result in the near term entry of competitor version biosimilars due to many factor including development timeline manufacturing challenge and or uncertainty regarding the regulatory pathway for approval of the competitor version generic pharmaceutical company could also introduce generic product before resolution of any related patent litigation there is no assurance that the patent we are seeking will be granted or that the patent we hold will be found valid and enforceable if challenged moreover patent relating to particular product us formulation or process do not preclude other manufacturer from employing alternative process or marketing alternative product or formulation that compete with our patented product in addition competitor or other third party may assert claim that our activity infringe patent or other intellectual property right held by them or allege third party right of ownership in our existing intellectual property see item management discussion and analysis result of operation executive overview other matter patent matter and item business patent trademark and other intellectual property right for more detail our long term success depends on intellectual property protection if our intellectual property right are invalidated circumvented or weakened our business will be adversely affected our long term success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire develop and commercialize innovative new medicine without strong intellectual property protection we would be unable to generate the return necessary to support our significant investment in research and development well the other expenditure required to bring new drug to the market intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time depending on local law and regulation change to such law and regulation could reduce protection for our innovative product in the in addition to the process for challenging patent set forth in the bpcia which applies to biologic product the hatch waxman act provides generic company powerful incentive to seek to invalidate our other pharmaceutical patent result we expect that our patent on major pharmaceutical product will continue to be routinely

patent may be invalidated through this expedited review process although such decision can be appealed to the court in certain circumstance loss in such proceeding could result in competitor entering the market while win provides no precedential value meaning the same patent can be challenged by other competitor we face many generic manufacturer challenge to our patent outside the well the entry of generic competitor typically result in rapid and severe decline in revenue in addition competitor or other third party may claim that our activity infringe patent or other intellectual property

innovative cost effective product that meet important medical need our product revenue can be adversely affected by the introduction by competitor of branded product that are perceived superior by the marketplace by generic or biosimilar version of our branded product and by generic or biosimilar version of other product in the same therapeutic class our branded product our revenue can also be adversely affected by treatment innovation that eliminate or minimize the need for treatment with our drug regulation of generic and biosimilar product varies around the world and such regulation is complex and subject to ongoing interpretation and implementation by regulatory agency and court particularly for biosimilars recent government proposal could make it easier le expensive and le time

slowdown including result of covid could lead to decreased utilization of our product affecting our sale volume declining tax revenue attributable to economic downturn increase the pressure on government to reduce health care spending leading to increasing government effort to control drug price and utilization additionally some customer including government or other entity reliant upon government funding may be unable to pay for our product in timely manner also if our customer supplier or collaboration partner experience financial difficulty we could experience slower customer

product see item business raw material and product supply for more detail reliance on third party relationship and outsourcing arrangement could adversely affect our business we rely on third party including supplier distributor alliance and collaboration with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology company and third party service provider for selected aspect of product development manufacturing commercialization support for information technology system product distribution and certain financial transactional process for example we outsource the day to day management and oversight of our clinical trial to contract research organization outsourcing these function involves the risk that the third party may not perform to our standard or legal requirement may not produce reliable result

have material adverse effect on our reputation or business public and private payer continue to take aggressive step to control their expenditure for pharmaceutical by placing restriction on pricing and reimbursement for and patient access to our medication these pressure could continue to negatively affect our future revenue and net income expect government and private payer worldwide to intensify their scrutiny of and action intended to address pricing reimbursement and access to pharmaceutical product additional regulation legislation or enforcement including result of the current

principle and interpretation well event that differ from our expectation could adversely affect our future effective tax rate in addition global tax authority routinely examine our tax return and are expected to become more aggressive in their examination of profit allocation among jurisdiction which could affect our anticipated tax liability in december the enacted tax reform legislation significantly revising tax law and number of other country are also actively considering or enacting tax change significant uncertainty currently exists regarding proposed tax policy of the current

income tax for more detail we have taken the position based on an opinion of tax counsel that our divestiture of elanco common stock in connection with the separation of elanco qualifies transaction that is tax free for federal income tax purpose if any fact assumption representation and undertaking from lilly and elanco regarding the past and future conduct of their respective business and other matter are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied the divestiture may not qualify for tax free treatment which could result in significant federal income tax liability for and our shareholder who exchanged their stock for elanco stock regulatory compliance problem could be damaging to the company the marketing promotional and pricing practice of pharmaceutical manufacturer well the manner in which manufacturer interact with purchaser prescribers and patient are subject to extensive regulation many company including have been subject to claim related to these practice asserted by federal state and foreign governmental authority private payer and consumer these claim have resulted in substantial expense and other significant consequence to we are and could in the future become subject to such investigation the outcome of which could include criminal charge and fine penalty or other monetary or non monetary remedy including exclusion from federal and other health care program such investigation may intensify result of the regulatory priority of the current presidential administration in addition regulatory issue concerning compliance with cgmp quality assurance and similar

position and cash generated from operation to differ materially from these forward looking statement executive overviewthis section provides an overview of our financial result recent product and late stage pipeline development and other matter affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry earnings per share eps data are presented on diluted basis covid pandemicin response to the covid pandemic we have been focused on maintaining reliable supply of our medicine reducing the strain on the medical system developing treatment for covid protecting the health safety and well being of our employee supporting our community and ensuring affordability of and access to our medicine particularly insulin we have experienced negative impact to our underlying business due to the covid pandemic including decrease in new prescription result of fewer patient visit to physician office to begin or change treatment change in payer segment mix and the use of patient affordability program in the united state due to rising unemployment additionally we have experienced and may continue to experience decreased demand result of lack of normal access and fewer in person interaction by patient and our employee with the healthcare system in certain location in the and around the world with covid outbreak we temporarily halted in person interaction by our employee with healthcare provider and increased virtual interaction while in person interaction have resumed in many location we may decide to halt such activity in the future and in those case expect to resume such interaction it is safe to do so and in compliance with applicable guidance and requirement we may experience additional pricing pressure resulting from the financial strain of the covid pandemic on government funded healthcare system around the world we remain committed to discovering and developing new treatment for the patient we serve at the beginning of the covid pandemic we paused new clinical trial start and enrollment in new trial in order to reduce the strain on the medical system and we have resumed this activity in our clinical trial however significant delay or unexpected issue such higher discontinuation rate or delay accumulating data affecting the timing conduct or regulatory review of our clinical trial could adversely affect our ability to commercialize some asset in our product pipeline if the covid pandemic continues for protracted period regard to covid therapy the food and drug administration fda granted emergency use authorization eua for bamlanivimab and bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together for higher risk patient who have been recently diagnosed with mild to moderate covid and for baricitinib in combination with remdesivir in hospitalized covid patient we are actively working with variety of organization including governmental agency to facilitate access to our covid treatment in various country however we face unique risk and uncertainty in our development manufacture and uptake of potential treatment for covid including vulnerability to supply chain disruption higher manufacturing cost difficulty in manufacturing sufficient quantity of our therapy restriction on administration that limit widespread and timely access to our therapy and risk related to handling return and or refund of product after delivery by expedited authorization process including our euas for bamlanivimab and bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together have allowed restricted distribution of product with le than typical safety and efficacy data and additional data that become available may call into question the safety or effectiveness of our covid therapy additionally the availability of superior or competitive therapy or preventative measure such vaccine coupled with the transient nature of pandemic could negatively impact or eliminate demand for our covid therapy in addition we may be required to accept return of certain product previously shipped pursuant to euas if the relevant eua is revoked or terminated mutation or the spread of other variant of the coronavirus could also render our therapy ineffective any of these risk could prevent from recouping our substantial investment in the research development and manufacture of our covid therapy our ability to continue to operate without significant negative impact will in part depend on our ability to protect our employee and our supply chain we have taken step to protect our employee worldwide with particular measure in place for those working in our manufacturing site and distribution facility for we were able to largely maintain our normal operation however uncertainty resulting from the covid pandemic could have an adverse impact on our manufacturing operation global supply chain and distribution system which could impact our ability to produce and distribute our product and the ability of third party on which we rely to fulfill their obligation to and could increase our expense although the covid pandemic ha affected our operation and demand for our product it ha not negatively impacted our liquidity position we expect to continue to generate cash flow to meet our short term liquidity need and to have access to liquidity via the short term and long term debt market we also have not observed any material impairment of our asset or significant change in the fair value of asset due to the covid pandemic the degree to which the covid pandemic will continue to impact our business operation financial result and liquidity will depend on future development is highly uncertain and can not be predicted due to among other thing the duration and severity of the pandemic the action taken to reduce it transmission including widespread availability of vaccine and the speed with which and extent to which more stable economic and operating condition resume should the covid pandemic and any associated recession or depression continue for prolonged period our result of operation financial condition liquidity and cash flow could be materially impacted by lower revenue and profitability and lower likelihood of effectively and efficiently developing and launching new medicine see risk factor in part item of this annual report on form for additional information on risk factor that could impact our result elanco animal health

preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the treatment may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on clinically significant endpoint are many difficulty and uncertainty inherent in pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new product well high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development to bring drug from the discovery phase to market can take over decade and often cost in excess of billion failure can occur at any point in the process including in later stage after substantial investment result most fund invested in research program will not generate financial return new product candidate that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concern inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approval or payer reimbursement or coverage limited scope of approved us change in the relevant treatment standard or the availability of new or better competitive product difficulty or excessive cost to manufacture or infringement of the patent or intellectual property right of others regulatory agency continue to establish high hurdle for the efficacy and safety of new product delay and uncertainty in drug approval process can result in delay in product launch and lost market opportunity in addition it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rate of new product we manage research and development spending across our portfolio of potential new medicine delay in or termination of any one project will not necessarily cause significant change in our total research and development spending due to the risk and uncertainty involved in the research and development process we can not reliably estimate the nature timing and cost of the effort necessary to complete the development of our research and development project can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from any successful research and development project each project represents only portion of the overall pipeline and none is individually material to our consolidated research and development expense while we do accumulate certain research and development cost on project level for internal reporting purpose we must make significant cost estimation and allocation some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanism therefore we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total research and development cost by project by preclinical versus clinical spend or by therapeutic category other matterspatent matterswe depend on patent or other form of intellectual property protection for most of our revenue cash flow and earnings our formulation patent for forteo expired in december and our use patent expired in august in major european market and the both the formulation patent and the use patent expired in august in japan we expect further volume decline result of the anticipated entry of generic and biosimilar competition following the loss of patent exclusivity in these market in the aggregate we expect that the decline in revenue will have material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation and cash flow the alimta vitamin regimen patent which we expect to provide with patent protection for alimta through june in japan and major european country and through may in the have been challenged in each of these jurisdiction in the most challenge have been finally resolved in our favor and one remains in active litigation we and eagle pharmaceutical inc eagle reached an agreement in december to settle all pending litigation allowing eagle limited initial entry into the market with it product starting february up to an approximate three week supply and subsequent unlimited entry starting april we expect that the entry of generic competition in the either from an unfavorable outcome to the patent challenge or following the loss of patent exclusivity will cause rapid and severe decline in revenue and have material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation and cash flow are aware that several company have received approval to market generic version of pemetrexed in major european market and that generic competitor may choose to attempt launch at risk following final decision in the supreme court of germany in july overturning the lower court and upholding the validity of our alimta patent several generic that were on the market at risk in germany left we have removed the remaining generic from the market in germany by obtaining preliminary injunction in our favor in september the paris court of first instance in france issued final decision upholding the validity of our alimta patent and found infringement by fresenius kabi france and fresenius kabi groupe france collectively kabi pemetrexed product the court issued an injunction against kabi and provisionally awarded damage in january that same court issued preliminary injunction against zentiva france zentiva the last remaining company with generic pemetrexed product on the french market and provisionally awarded damage in october the court of appeal of the netherlands overturned lower court decision and ruled that our alimta patent is valid and infringed and reinstated an injunction against kabi thereby removing kabi pemetrexed product from the netherlands market kabi ha appealed this decision to the netherlands supreme court kabi generic pemetrexed product wa the only at risk generic on the market in the netherlands our vitamin regimen patent have also been challenged in other smaller european jurisdiction we expect that further entry of generic competition for alimta in major european market following either the loss of effective patent protection or of patent exclusivity will cause rapid and severe decline in revenue see note to the consolidated financial statement for more detailed account of the legal proceeding currently pending in the europe and japan regarding among others our alimta patent the compound patent for humalog insulin lispro ha expired in major market global regulator have different legal pathway to approve similar version of insulin lispro competitor launched similar version of insulin lispro in certain european market in and in the in the second quarter of while it is difficult to estimate the severity of the impact of insulin lispro product entering the market we do not expect and have not experienced rapid and severe decline in revenue however we expect additional pricing pressure and some loss of market share that would continue over time our compound patent protection for cymbalta expired in japan in january we expect generic to enter the market in mid we expect that the entry of generic competition will cause rapid and severe decline in revenue and will have material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation and cash flow foreign currency exchange ratesas global company with substantial operation outside the we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rate primarily the dollar against the euro and japanese yen while we seek to manage portion of these exposure through hedging and other risk management technique significant fluctuation in currency rate can have material impact either positive or negative on our revenue cost of sale and operating expense while there is uncertainty in the future movement in foreign exchange rate fluctuation in these rate could negatively impact our future consolidated result of operation and cash flow trend affecting pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and accessu in the public concern over access to and affordability of pharmaceutical continues to drive the regulatory and legislative debate these policy and political issue increase the risk that tax fee rebate or other cost control measure may be enacted to manage federal and state budget key health policy initiative affecting biopharmaceuticals include the coronavirus aid relief and economic security care act and subsequent stimulus bill that focus on ensuring availability and access to lifesaving drug during public health crisis foreign reference pricing in medicare and private insurance modification to medicare part and provision that would allow the

manufacturer drug rebate proposal that would require biopharmaceutical manufacturer to disclose proprietary drug pricing information and state level proposal related to prescription drug price and reducing the cost of pharmaceutical purchased by government health care program on july and september former president donald trump signed executive order related to the prescription drug program rebate reform in medicare part drug importation including insulin and foreign reference pricing in medicare part and part although their current status is unclear given the change in presidential administration these executive order if implemented could have material adverse impact on our future consolidated result of operation liquidity and financial position on september lilly announced it would distribute all ceiling priced product directly to covered entity and their child site only lilly provides discount to contract pharmacy only if it is wholly owned subsidiary of covered entity if covered entity doe not have an in house pharmacy or in the case of insulin if the subject covered entity and it contract pharmacy agree to pas along the discount to patient without any markup for dispensing fee and without billing insurance or collecting duplicate discount lilly ha been transparent with regulator on it distribution activity and continues to comply with all program requirement certain covered entity and their trade association have threatened litigation questioning whether lilly program and similar action by other manufacturer violate program requirement on october three covered entity sued hhs and the health resource and service administration hrsa in the district court for the district of columbia seeking to compel the agency to take enforcement action against lilly and three other company among other requested relief on october trade association representing certain covered entity sued hhs in the same court seeking to compel the agency to promulgate administrative dispute resolution regulation on december number of association and entity filed suit against hhs in the district court for the northern district of california requesting immediate enforcement of the contract pharmacy guidance on december the general counsel of hhs issued an advisory opinion alleging that honoring contract pharmacy agreement is mandatory in january lilly filed suit against hhs the secretary of hhs the hrsa and the administrator of the hrsa in the district court for the southern district of indiana seeking declaratory judgment that hhs attempt to require manufacturer to permit contract pharmacy distribution is unlawful and preliminary injunction enjoining implementation of the alternative dispute resolution process created by defendant and with it their application of the advisory opinion and other related relief the case are pending and the impact of these case and any subsequent litigation is uncertain see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information california and several other state have enacted legislation related to prescription drug pricing transparency and it is unclear the effect this legislation will have on our business several state have also passed importation legislation including colorado florida maine new hampshire new mexico and vermont of late several of these state were actively working with the former presidential administration to implement an importation program from canada on november florida announced it submitted proposed importation plan to the in hhs and the fda also took several action to advance state importation initiative including issuing request for proposal for personal importation and reimportation of insulin and final rule on the importation of prescription drug additionally on november the canadian minister of health issued an interim order to ensure that participation in bulk importation framework such the one recently established by the doe not cause or exacerbate drug shortage in canada we continue to review these state proposal and legislation well federal rule and guidance published by hhs and the fda the impact of which is uncertain at this time currently it is unclear if the current presidential administration will adopt any of the importation initiative put forth by the former presidential administration we will continue to monitor and ass these development the private sector consolidation and integration among healthcare provider significantly affect the competitive marketplace for pharmaceutical health plan pharmacy benefit manager wholesaler and other supply chain stakeholder have been consolidating into fewer larger entity thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance private third party insurer well government typically maintain formulary that specify coverage the condition under which drug are included on plan formulary and reimbursement the associated out of pocket cost to the consumer to control cost by negotiating discounted price in exchange for formulary inclusion formulary placement can lead to reduced usage of drug for the relevant patient population due to coverage restriction such prior authorization and formulary exclusion or due to reimbursement limitation that result in higher consumer out of pocket cost such non preferred co pay tier increased co insurance level and higher deductible consequently pharmaceutical company compete for formulary placement not only on the basis of product attribute such efficacy safety profile or patient ease of use but also by providing rebate value based agreement where pricing is based on achievement or not of specified outcome are another tool that may be utilized between payer and pharmaceutical company formulary placement and pricing are negotiated price is an increasingly important factor in formulary decision particularly in treatment area in which the payer ha taken the position that multiple branded product are therapeutically comparable we expect these downward pricing pressure will continue to negatively affect our consolidated result of operation in addition to formulary placement change in insurance design continue to drive greater consumer cost sharing through high deductible plan and higher co insurance or co pay we continue to invest in patient affordability solution resulting in lower revenue in an effort to assist patient in affording their medicine the main coverage expansion provision of the affordable care act aca are currently in effect through both state based exchange and the expansion of medicaid trend ha been the prevalence of benefit design containing high out of pocket cost for patient particularly for pharmaceutical in addition to the coverage expansion many employer in the commercial market continue to evaluate strategy such private exchange and wider use of consumer driven health plan to reduce their healthcare liability over time federal legislation litigation or administrative action to repeal or modify some or all of the provision of the aca could have material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation and cash flow at the same time the broader paradigm shift towards performance based reimbursement and the launch of several value based purchasing initiative have placed demand on the pharmaceutical industry to offer product with proven real world outcome data and favorable economic profile internationalinternational operation also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulation cost containment measure exist in number of country including additional price control and mechanism to limit reimbursement for our product such policy are expected to increase in impact and reach given the pressure on national and regional health care budget that come from growing aging population and ongoing economic challenge additional reform are finalized we will ass their impact on future revenue in addition government in many emerging market are becoming increasingly active in expanding health care system offering given the budget challenge of increasing health care coverage for citizen policy may be proposed that promote generic and biosimilars only and reduce current and future access to branded pharmaceutical product the covid pandemic is also creating additional pressure on health system worldwide result cost containment and other measure may intensify government manage and emerge from the pandemic tax matterswe are subject to income tax and various other tax in the and in many foreign jurisdiction therefore change in both domestic and international tax law or regulation could affect our effective tax rate result of operation and cash flow country around the world including the are actively considering and enacting tax law change the current presidential administration tax proposal contains significant change including the rate at which income of company would be taxed further action taken with respect to tax related matter by association such the organisation for economic co operation and development and the european commission could influence tax policy in country in which we operate in addition global tax authority routinely examine our tax return and are expected to become more aggressive in their examination of profit allocation among jurisdiction which

discrete tax benefit in operating result for discussion of our result of operation pertaining to and see item management discussion and analysis of result of operation and financial condition in our annual report on form for the year ended december condition and liquiditywe believe our available cash and cash equivalent together with our ability to generate operating cash flow and our access to short term and long term borrowing are sufficient to fund our existing and planned capital requirement which include working capital requirement including related to employee payroll clinical trial manufacturing material and tax capital expenditure share repurchase and dividend repayment of outstanding short term and long term borrowing contribution to our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plan milestone and royalty payment and potential business development activity including acquisition strategic alliance collaboration investment and licensing arrangement our management

will be consistent with our past level relative to revenue cash and cash equivalent increased to billion of december compared with billion at december net cash provided by operating activity wa billion in compared with billion in net cash provided by operating activity in included approximately million of cash paid to settle the accelerated vesting of loxo employee equity award see note to the consolidated financial statement refer to the consolidated statement of cash flow for additional detail on the significant source and us of cash for the year ended december and in addition to our cash and cash equivalent we held total investment of billion and billion of december and respectively see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional detail in february we completed our acquisition of dermira for per share or approximately billion which wa funded through cash on hand and the issuance of commercial paper in february we completed our acquisition of loxo for per share or approximately billion which wa funded through mixture of cash and debt see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information of december total debt wa billion an increase of billion compared with billion at december the increase primarily related to the net proceeds from the issuance of billion of percent fixed rate note in may well the net proceeds from the issuance of an additional million of percent fixed rate note and the issuance of million of percent fixed rate note in august we used the net proceeds from the sale of these note for general corporate purpose which included the repayment of outstanding commercial paper used to fund portion of the purchase price for our acquisition of dermira see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information of december we had total of billion of unused committed bank credit facility billion of which is available to support our commercial paper program see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional detail we believe that amount accessible through existing commercial paper market should be adequate to fund any short term borrowing need for the consecutive year we distributed dividend to our shareholder dividend of per share and per share were paid in and respectively in the fourth quarter of effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of the quarterly dividend wa increased to per share resulting in an indicated annual rate for of per share capital expenditure of billion during compared to billion in we repurchased million of share under our billion share repurchase program authorized in june of december we had billion remaining under this program see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional detail on march we completed the disposition of our remaining percent ownership of elanco common stock through tax free exchange offer which resulted in reduction in share of our common stock outstanding by approximately million of that date in january we completed our acquisition of prevail for per share or approximately million in cash plus one non tradable cvr that entitles prevail stockholder to up to an additional per share in cash or an aggregate of approximately million payable subject to certain term and condition this acquisition wa funded primarily through cash on hand and the issuance of commercial paper see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information see result of operation executive overview other matter patent matter for information regarding recent and upcoming loss of patent protection both domestically and abroad we continue to monitor the potential impact of the economic environment the creditworthiness of our wholesaler and other customer including foreign government backed agency and supplier the uncertain impact of health care legislation and various international government funding level in the normal course of business our operation are exposed to fluctuation in interest rate currency value and fair value of equity security these fluctuation can vary the cost of financing investing and operating we seek to address portion of these risk through controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instrument the objective of this risk management program is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuation in interest and currency exchange rate all derivative activity are for purpose other than trading our primary interest rate risk exposure result from change in short term dollar interest rate in an effort to manage interest rate exposure we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt position and may enter into interest rate derivative to help maintain that balance based on our overall interest rate exposure at december and including derivative and other interest rate risk sensitive instrument hypothetical percent change in interest rate applied to the fair value of the instrument of december and respectively would not have material impact on earnings cash flow or fair value of interest rate risk sensitive instrument over one year period our foreign currency risk exposure result from fluctuating currency exchange rate primarily the dollar against the euro and japanese yen we face foreign currency exchange exposure when we enter into transaction arising from subsidiary trade and loan payable and receivables denominated in foreign currency we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the result of our global operation to the dollar at exchange rate that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period we may enter into foreign currency forward or option derivative contract to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rate principally the euro and the japanese yen our corporate risk management policy outline the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposure gain and loss on these derivative contract offset in part the impact of currency fluctuation on the existing asset and liability we periodically analyze the fair value of the outstanding foreign currency derivative contract to determine their sensitivity to change in foreign exchange rate hypothetical percent change in exchange rate primarily against the dollar applied to the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency derivative contract of december and would not have material impact on earnings cash flow or financial position over one year period this sensitivity analysis doe not consider the impact that hypothetical change in exchange rate would have on the underlying foreign currency denominated transaction our fair value risk exposure relates primarily to our public equity investment and to equity investment that do not have readily determinable fair value of december and our carrying value of these investment were billion and billion respectively hypothetical percent change in fair value of the equity instrument would have impacted other net income expense by million and million of december and respectively have no off balance sheet arrangement that have material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have material future effect on our financial condition change in financial condition revenue or expense result of operation liquidity capital expenditure or capital resource we acquire and collaborate on potential product still in development and enter into research and development arrangement with third party that often require milestone and royalty payment to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future event linked to the success of the asset in development milestone payment may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product approval for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sale level if required by the arrangement we may make royalty payment based upon percentage of the sale of the product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained individually these arrangement are generally not material in any one annual reporting period however if milestone for multiple product covered by these arrangement were reached in the same reporting period the aggregate expense or aggregate milestone payment made could be material to our result of operation or cash flow respectively in that period see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional detail these arrangement often give the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product which would allow to avoid making the contingent payment however we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objective we also note that from business perspective we view these payment positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flow from sale of product of critical accounting estimatesin preparing our financial statement in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the gaap we must often make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue expense and related disclosure some of those judgment can be subjective and complex and consequently actual result could differ from those estimate for any given individual estimate or assumption we make it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same fact and circumstance could develop different estimate we believe that given current fact and circumstance it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation financial position or liquidity for the period presented in this report our most critical accounting estimate have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below revenue recognition and sale return rebate and discount accrualswe recognize revenue primarily from two different type of contract product sale to customer net product revenue and collaboration and other arrangement for product sale to customer provision for return rebate and discount are established in the same period the related product sale are recognized to determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sale at the time we recognize sale to direct customer we estimate any rebate or discount that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customer in the distribution chain under the term of our contract significant judgment are required in making these estimate the largest of our sale rebate and discount amount are rebate associated with sale covered by managed care medicare medicaid and chargeback contract in the in determining the appropriate accrual amount we consider our historical rebate payment for these program by product percentage of our historical sale well any significant change in sale trend patent expiry and product launch an evaluation of the current contract for these program the percentage of our product that are sold via these program and our product pricing refer to note to the consolidated financial statement for further information on revenue recognition and sale return rebate and discount accrual revenue recognized from collaboration and other arrangement will include our share of profit from the collaboration well royalty upfront and milestone payment we receive under these type of contract financial statement impactwe believe that our accrual for sale return rebate and discount are reasonable and appropriate based on current fact and circumstance our global rebate and discount liability are included in sale rebate and discount on our consolidated balance sheet our global sale return liability is included in other current liability and other noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet of december percent change in our global sale return rebate and discount liability would have led to an approximate million effect on our income before income tax the portion of our global sale return rebate and discount liability resulting from sale of our product in the wa approximately percent of december and the following represents roll forward of our most significant sale return rebate and discount liability balance including managed care medicare medicaid chargebacks and patient assistance program dollar in million return rebate and discount liability beginning of year reduction of net sale cash payment sale return rebate and discount liability end of year adjustment of the estimate for these return rebate and discount to actual result were le than percent of consolidated net sale for each of the year presented litigation liability and other contingenciesbackground and uncertaintiesproduct litigation liability and other contingency are by their nature uncertain and based upon complex judgment and probability the factor we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserve and other contingent liability amount include the merit and jurisdiction of the litigation the nature and the number of other similar current and past matter the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussion if any in addition we accrue for certain product liability claim incurred but not filed to the extent we can formulate reasonable estimate of their cost based primarily on historical claim experience and data regarding product usage we accrue legal defense cost expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingency when both probable and reasonably estimable we also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for period covered by insurance in assessing our insurance coverage we consider the policy coverage limit and exclusion the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company the financial condition of the insurer and the possibility of and length of time for collection due to very restrictive market for product liability insurance we are self insured for product liability loss for all our currently marketed product in addition to insurance coverage we consider any third party indemnification to which we are entitled or under which we are obligated with respect to our third party indemnification right these consideration include the nature of the indemnification the financial condition of the indemnifying party and the possibility of and length of time for collection the litigation accrual and environmental liability and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on gross basis liability and asset respectively on our consolidated balance sheet acquisitionsbackground and uncertaintiesto determine whether acquisition or licensing transaction should be accounted for business combination or an asset acquisition we make certain judgment which include assessing whether the acquired set of activity and asset would meet the definition of business under the relevant accounting rule if the acquired set of activity and asset meet the definition of business asset acquired and liability assumed are required to be recorded at their respective fair value of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net asset where applicable is recorded goodwill if the acquired set of activity and asset doe not meet the definition of business the transaction is recorded an acquisition of asset and therefore any acquired ipr that doe not have an alternative future use is charged to expense at the acquisition date and goodwill is not recorded refer to note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information the judgment made in determining estimated fair value assigned to asset acquired and liability assumed in business combination well estimated asset life can materially affect our consolidated result of operation the fair value of intangible asset including acquired ipr are determined using information available near the acquisition date based on estimate and assumption that are deemed reasonable by management significant estimate and assumption include but are not limited to probability of technical success revenue growth and discount rate depending on the fact and circumstance we may deem it necessary to engage an independent valuation expert to assist in valuing significant asset and liability the fair value of identifiable intangible asset are primarily determined using an income method described in note to the consolidated financial statement of indefinite lived and long lived assetsbackground and uncertaintieswe review the carrying value of long lived asset both intangible and tangible for potential impairment on periodic basis and whenever event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable we identify impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flow to be generated by the asset or asset group to it carrying value if an impairment is identified loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset net book value over it fair value and the cost basis is adjusted goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicator are present by first assessing qualitative factor to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is le than it carrying amount if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value is le than the carrying amount quantitative test that compare the fair value of the intangible asset to it carrying value is performed to determine the amount of any impairment several method may be used to determine the estimated fair value of acquired ipr all of which require multiple assumption we utilize the income method described in note to the consolidated financial statement for acquired ipr asset the risk of failure ha been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these asset ultimately will yield successful product discussed previously in result of operation executive overview late stage pipeline the nature of the pharmaceutical business is high risk and requires that we invest in large number of project to maintain successful portfolio of approved product such it is likely that some acquired ipr asset will become impaired in the future estimate of future cash flow based on we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumption and projection require management judgment actual result could vary materially from these estimate retirement benefit assumptionsbackground and uncertaintiesdefined benefit pension plan and retiree health benefit plan cost include assumption for the discount rate expected return on plan asset and retirement age these assumption have significant effect on the amount reported in addition to the analysis below see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information regarding our retirement benefit annually we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan asset in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plan we use an actuarially determined plan specific yield curve of high quality fixed income debt instrument to determine the discount rate in evaluating the expected return on plan asset we consider many factor with primary analysis of current and projected market condition asset return and asset allocation approximately percent of which are growth investment and the view of leading financial adviser and economist we may also review our historical assumption compared with actual result well the discount rate and expected return on plan asset of other company where applicable in evaluating our expected retirement age assumption we consider the retirement age of our past employee eligible for pension and medical benefit together with our expectation of future retirement age annually we determine the fair value of the plan asset in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plan approximately percent of our plan asset are in hedge fund and private equity like investment fund collectively alternative asset we value these alternative investment using significant unobservable input or using the net asset value reported by the counterparty adjusted necessary input include underlying net asset value discounted cash flow valuation comparable market valuation and adjustment for currency credit liquidity and other risk statement impactif the discount rate for the defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plan plan were to change by quarter percentage point income before income tax would change by million if the expected return on plan asset for plan were to change by quarter percentage point income before income tax would change by million if our assumption regarding the expected age of future retiree for plan were adjusted by one year our income before income tax would be affected by million the plan including puerto rico represent approximately percent and percent of the total projected benefit obligation and total plan asset respectively at december adjustment to the fair value of plan asset are not recognized in pension and retiree health benefit expense in the year that the adjustment occur such change are deferred along with other actuarial gain and loss and are amortized into expense over the expected remaining service life of employee income taxesbackground and uncertaintieswe prepare and file tax return based upon our interpretation of tax law and regulation and we record estimate based upon these interpretation our tax return are routinely subject to examination by various taxing authority which could result in future tax interest and penalty assessment inherent uncertainty exist in estimate of many tax position due to change in tax law resulting from legislation and regulation concluded through the various jurisdiction tax court system we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merit of the position the tax benefit recognized in the financial statement from such position are measured based on the largest benefit that ha greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution the amount of unrecognized tax benefit is adjusted for change in fact and circumstance for example adjustment could result from change to existing tax law the issuance of regulation by the taxing authority new information obtained during tax examination or resolution of tax examination we believe our estimate for uncertain tax position are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessment that may result from examination of our tax return we recognize both accrued interest and penalty related to unrecognized tax benefit in income tax expense we have recorded valuation allowance against certain of our deferred tax asset primarily those that have been generated from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdiction in evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax asset we have not assumed future taxable income in the jurisdiction associated with these carryforwards where history doe not support such an assumption implementation of tax planning strategy to recover these deferred tax asset or to generate future taxable income in these jurisdiction could lead to the reversal of all or portion of these valuation allowance and reduction of income tax expense financial statement impactas of december percent change in the amount of uncertain tax position and the valuation allowance would result in change in net income of million and million respectively legal and regulatory matter information relating to certain legal proceeding can be found in note to the consolidated financial statement and is incorporated by reference financial expectation for for the full year of we expect eps to be in the range of to which excludes estimated acquisition and integration cost related to the acquisition of prevail we anticipate total revenue between billion and billion including an estimated billion to billion of revenue from covid therapy revenue growth is expected to be driven by volume from trulicity taltz verzenio jardiance olumiant cyramza emgality tyvyt and retevmo well by covid therapy revenue growth is expected to be partially offset by lower revenue for product that have lost patent exclusivity we expect mid single digit net price decline globally in in the we expect

significant accounting policiesour other significant accounting policy are described in the remaining appropriate note to the consolidated financial statement implementation of new financial accounting standardseffective january we adopted accounting standard update lease using the modified retrospective approach applied at the beginning of the period of adoption and we elected the package of transitional practical expedient the adoption of this standard resulted in recording of operating lease asset of approximately million which included reclassifying approximately million of deferred rent and lease incentive net of prepaid rent component of the operating lease asset of january the adoption also resulted in recording operating lease liability of approximately million of january our accounting for finance lease remained substantially unchanged adoption of this standard did not result in material change in net income in the year of adoption effective january we adopted accounting standard update revenue from contract with customer and other related update this standard requires entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised good or service to customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those good or service we applied this standard to contract for which performance wa not substantially complete of the date of adoption for those contract that were modified prior to the date of adoption we reflected the aggregate effect of those modification when determining the appropriate accounting under the new standard we believe the effect of applying this practical expedient resulted in material difference we applied this standard through cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of the beginning of the year of adoption upon adoption the cumulative effect of applying this standard resulted in an increase of approximately million to retained earnings of january adoption of this standard did not result in material change in revenue or net income in the year of adoption effective january we adopted accounting standard update asu financial instrument overall recognition and measurement of financial asset and financial liability this standard requires entity to recognize change in the fair value of equity investment with readily determinable fair

for certain of our retirement benefit plan refer to note for additional information note revenuethe following table summarizes our revenue recognized in our consolidated statement of operation product revenue collaboration and other revenue revenue collaboration and other revenue associated with prior period transfer of intellectual property wa million million and million during the year ended december and respectively we recognize revenue primarily from two different type of contract product sale to customer net product revenue and collaboration and other arrangement revenue recognized from collaboration and other arrangement will include our share of profit from the collaboration well royalty upfront and milestone payment we receive under these type of contract see note for additional information related to our collaboration and other arrangement collaboration and other revenue disclosed above includes the revenue from the trajenta and jardiance family of product resulting from our collaboration with boehringer ingelheim discussed in note substantially all of the remainder of collaboration and other revenue is related to contract accounted for contract with customer net product revenuerevenue from sale of product is recognized at the point where the customer obtains control of the good and we satisfy our performance obligation which generally is at the time we ship the product to the customer payment term differ by jurisdiction and customer but payment term in most of our major jurisdiction typically range from to day from date of shipment revenue for our product sale ha not been adjusted for the effect of financing component we expect at contract inception that the period between when we transfer control of the product and when we receive payment will be one year or le any exception are either not material or we collect interest for payment made after the due date provision for rebate discount and return are established in the same period the related sale are recognized we generally ship product shortly after order are received therefore we generally only have few day of order received but not yet shipped at the end of any reporting period shipping and handling activity are considered to be fulfillment activity and are not considered to be separate performance obligation we exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all tax assessed by governmental authority that are imposed on our sale of product and collected from customer most of our product are sold to wholesaler that serve pharmacy physician and other health care professional and hospital for the year ended december and our three largest wholesaler each accounted for between percent and percent of consolidated revenue further they each accounted for between percent and percent of account receivable of december and significant judgment must be made in determining the transaction price for our sale of product related to anticipated rebate discount and return the following describe the most significant of these judgment sale rebate and discount background and uncertainty we initially invoice our customer at contractual list price contract with direct and indirect customer may provide for various rebate and discount that may differ in each contract consequence to determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sale at the time we recognize sale to direct customer we must estimate any rebate or discount that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customer in the distribution chain under the term of our contract significant judgment are required in making these estimate the rebate and discount amount are recorded deduction to arrive at our net product revenue sale rebate and discount that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include managed care medicare medicaid chargebacks long term care hospital patient assistance program and various other program we estimate these accrual using an expected value approach the largest of our sale rebate and discount amount are rebate associated with sale covered by managed care medicare medicaid chargeback and patient assistance program in the in determining the appropriate accrual amount we consider our historical rebate payment for these program by product percentage of our historical sale well any significant change in sale trend patent expiry and product launch an evaluation of the current contract for these program the percentage of our product that are sold via these program and our product pricing although we accrue liability for rebate related to these program at the time we record the sale the rebate related to that sale is typically paid up to six month later because of this time lag in any particular period our rebate adjustment may incorporate revision of accrual for several period most of our rebate outside the are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period the related sale in some large european country government rebate are based on the anticipated budget for pharmaceutical payment in the country an estimate of these rebate updated governmental authority revise budgeted deficit is recognized in the same period the related sale sale return background and uncertainty when product sale occur to determine the appropriate transaction price for our sale we estimate reserve for future product return related to those sale using an expected value approach this estimate is based on several factor including historical return rate expiration date by product on average approximately month after the initial sale of product to our customer and estimated level of inventory in the wholesale and retail channel well any other specifically identified anticipated return due to known factor such the loss of patent exclusivity product recall and discontinuance or changing competitive environment we maintain return policy that allows most customer to return product for dating issue within specified period prior to and subsequent to the product expiration date following the loss of exclusivity for patent dependent product we expect to experience an elevated level of product return product inventory remaining in the wholesale and retail channel expires in the we allow bamlanivimab to be returned if the emergency use authorization eua is revoked if the eua were to be revoked we could experience an elevated level of product return of bamlanivimab dependent on the amount of product remaining in the distribution channel adjustment to the return reserve have been and may in the future be required based on revised estimate to our assumption we record the return amount deduction to arrive at our net product revenue once the product is returned it is destroyed we do not record right of return asset our return policy outside the are generally more restrictive than in the return are not allowed for reason other than failure to meet product specification in many country our reserve for future product return for product sale outside the is not material part of our process to estimate reserve for product return we regularly review the supply level of our significant product at the major wholesaler in the and in major market outside the primarily by reviewing periodic inventory report supplied by our major wholesaler and available prescription volume information for our product or alternative approach we attempt to maintain wholesaler inventory level at an average of approximately one month or le on consistent basis across our product portfolio cause of unusual wholesaler buying pattern include actual or anticipated product supply issue weather pattern anticipated change in the transportation network redundant holiday stocking and change in wholesaler business operation in the the current structure of our arrangement provides with data on inventory level at our wholesaler however our data on inventory level in the retail channel is more limited wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically ha not caused any material change in the rate of actual product return actual product return have been le than percent of our revenue over each of the past three year and have not fluctuated significantly percentage of revenue although fluctuation are more likely in period following loss of patent exclusivity for major product in the market adjustment to revenueadjustments to increase revenue recognized result of change in estimate for the judgment described above for our most significant sale return rebate and discount liability balance for product shipped in previous period were approximately percent percent and percent of revenue during and respectively collaboration and other arrangementswe recognize several type of revenue from our collaboration and other arrangement which we discus in general term immediately below and more specifically in note for each of our material collaboration and other arrangement our collaboration and other arrangement are not contract with customer but are evaluated to determine whether any aspect of the arrangement are contract with customer revenue related to product we sell pursuant to these arrangement is included in net product revenue while other source of revenue royalty and profit sharing from our partner are included in collaboration and other revenue initial fee and developmental milestone we receive in collaborative and other similar arrangement from the partnering of our compound under development are generally deferred and amortized into income through the expected product approval date profit sharing due from our collaboration partner which is based upon gross margin reported to by our partner is recognized collaboration and other revenue earned royalty revenue from licensee and certain of our collaboration partner which is based on sale to third party of licensed product and technology is recorded when the third party sale occurs and the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty ha been allocated ha been satisfied or partially satisfied this royalty revenue is included in collaboration and other revenue for arrangement involving multiple good or service research and development marketing and selling manufacturing and distribution each required good or service is evaluated to determine whether it is distinct if good or service doe not qualify distinct it is combined with the other non distinct good or service within the arrangement and these combined good or service are treated single performance obligation for accounting purpose the arrangement transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation for arrangement that involve variable consideration where we have sold intellectual property we recognize revenue based on estimate of the amount of consideration we believe we will be entitled to receive from the other party subject to constraint these estimate are adjusted to reflect the actual amount to be collected when those fact and circumstance become known significant judgment must be made in determining the transaction price for our sale of intellectual property because of the risk that product in development will not receive regulatory approval we generally do not recognize any contingent payment that would be due to upon or after regulatory approval we have entered into arrangement whereby we transferred right to product and committed to supply for period of time for those arrangement for which we concluded that the obligation were not distinct any amount received upfront are being amortized to revenue net product revenue over the period of the supply arrangement the performance obligation is satisfied liabilitiesour contract liability result from arrangement where we have received payment in advance of performance under the contract and do not include sale return rebate and discount change in contract liability are generally due to either receipt of additional advance payment or our performance under the contract the following table summarizes contract liability balance liability the contract liability balance disclosed above of december and were primarily related to the remaining license period of symbolic intellectual property and obligation to perform research and development activity or supply product for defined period of time during the year ended
