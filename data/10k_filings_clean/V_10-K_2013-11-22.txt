adverse impact on our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business we generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fee in purchase transaction those fee are paid by the acquirer to the issuer they are however factor on which we compete with other payment provider and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transaction we process consequently change to these fee can substantially affect our revenue and the pace or breadth of overall payment electronification we have historically set default debit interchange reimbursement rate in the united state and many other geography however the dodd frank act ha limited our ability to establish default debit interchange reimbursement rate in the united state see the dodd frank act may continue to have material adverse impact on our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business interchange reimbursement rate have also become subject to continued or increased government regulation elsewhere and regulatory authority and central bank in number of jurisdiction have reviewed or are reviewing these rate in certain jurisdiction interchange reimbursement rate our operating regulation and related practice are subject to continuing or increased government regulation these jurisdiction include for example australia canada brazil europe india malaysia russia and south africa when we can not set default interchange reimbursement rate at optimal level issuer and acquirer find our payment system le attractive this lower overall transaction volume and slows growth of transaction it also may increase the attractiveness of other payment system like competitor closed loop payment system with direct connection to merchant and consumer in addition we believe some issuer are charging new or higher fee to consumer in some instance this make visa branded card and payment product le desirable and reduces our transaction volume and profitability some acquirer elect to charge higher discount rate to merchant regardless of the level of visa interchange reimbursement rate leading merchant not to accept visa branded card or payment product for payment or to steer account holder to alternate payment system in addition some issuer and acquirer have obtained and may continue to obtain incentive from and reduction in the rate that we charge in an effort to reduce the expense of their card program for these reason additional regulation of interchange reimbursement rate may have material adverse impact on our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business additional regulation that prohibit from contracting with client or requiring them to use only our network or that deny them the option of selecting only our network may decrease the number of transaction we process and materially and adversely affect our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business in order to provide account holder consistent experience and transparency into the network processing their transaction we promote certain practice to ensure that visa branded card are processed over our network we have historically had agreement with some issuer under which they agree to issue certain payment card that use of contentsonly the visa network or receive incentive if they do so in addition certain issuer of some product have historically chosen to include only our network we refer to these various practice network exclusivity in addition certain network or issuer rule or practice may be viewed limiting the routing option of merchant when multiple debit network co reside on visa debit card for example visa rule require that an acquirer must process authorization for all international transaction through visanet and that member must clear international transaction through visanet these are commonly referred to routing rule the dodd frank act already limit our and issuer ability to adopt network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit area see the dodd frank act may continue to have material adverse impact on our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business additional regulation like the dodd frank act in the united state and elsewhere could materially decrease the number of transaction we process in order to retain that transaction volume we would have to reduce the fee we charge to issuer or acquirer or increase the payment and other incentive we provide to issuer acquirer or merchant any of these eventuality could have material adverse effect on our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business the dodd frank act may continue to have material adverse impact on our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business of october in accordance with the dodd frank act the federal reserve capped the maximum debit interchange reimbursement rate charged by large financial institution at twenty one cent plus five basis point applying an interim fraud adjustment to an additional one cent this amounted to significant reduction from the average system wide fee charged previously the federal reserve also issued regulation requiring issuer to make at least two unaffiliated network available for processing debit transaction on each debit card the rule also prohibit and issuer from restricting merchant ability to direct the routing of electronic debit transaction over any of the network that an issuer ha enabled to process those transaction in july federal court invalidated these rule finding that the federal reserve improperly considered certain cost in setting cap on the maximum debit interchange reimbursement rate and that issuer must make at least two unaffiliated network available for processing each electronic debit transaction regardless of authorization method the federal reserve ha appealed that ruling these regulation have adversely affected our debit business and associated revenue by creating negative pressure on our pricing reduced the volume and number of debit payment we process and diminished associated revenue although we believe we have absorbed the principal impact of the regulation issued in october our business could continue to be affected including if the federal reserve must issue new regulation these pressure have arisen through various channel number of our client obtained fee reduction or increased incentive from to offset their own lost revenue some reduced the number of debit card they issued and investment they made in marketing and reward program some imposed new or higher fee on debit card or demand deposit account relationship some elected to issue fewer card enabled with visa affiliated network many merchant have used the routing regulation to redirect transaction or steer account holder to other network based on lowest cost or other factor other client and merchant are likely to take similar action in the future the dodd frank act created an independent consumer financial protection bureau with responsibility for most federal consumer protection law in the area of financial service and new authority with respect to consumer protection issue including those pertaining to to some extent these action may make payment card transaction le attractive to issuer consumer and merchant by further regulating disclosure payment card practice fee routing and other matter with respect to credit debit and prepaid card some element of the dodd frank act lack definition and create the potential for network to pursue different strategy subject to their interpretation of the rule our interpretation may result in pursuit of strategy that may be le effective than those of our competitor overall the regulation and development arising from the dodd frank act could continue to have material adverse effect on our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business new law or regulation in one jurisdiction or of one product offering may lead to new law or regulation in other jurisdiction or of other product offering of contentsregulators around the world increasingly note each other approach to the regulation of the payment industry consequently development in one country state or region may influence regulatory approach in another the dodd frank act and the european union commission draft interchange regulation are development with such potential similarly new law and regulation involving one product offering may cause lawmaker there to extend the regulation to other product offering for example regulation affecting debit payment could eventually spread to credit payment the risk created by new law or regulation have the potential to be replicated and to negatively affect our business in another region or in other product offering result we may face differing rule and regulation in matter like interchange reimbursement rate network exclusivity preferred routing dynamic currency conversion point of sale transaction rule and practice and operating regulation that may differ from country to country or by product offering if widely varying regulation come into existence worldwide we may have difficulty rapidly adjusting our product offering service and fee and other important aspect of our business in the various region in addition adverse development regulation and litigation with respect to our industry or another industry may also by association negatively impact our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against any of these factor could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation government action may prevent from competing effectively against provider of domestic payment service in certain country which may materially and adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenue and extend our global brand government in some country provide resource or protection to select their domestic payment card network brand and processor these government may impose regulatory requirement that favor domestic provider or that mandate domestic payment processing be done entirely in that country for example china unionpay continues to enjoy advantage over international network remains the sole processor of domestic transaction and operates the sole domestic acceptance mark in china these action could impede from utilizing our global processing capability for our financial institution client in those country and substantially restrict our activity there these action could also force to leave country where we presently have activity and keep from entering new market although we are trying to effect change in these country we may not succeed this could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenue and extend our global brand regulation in the area of consumer privacy and data use and security could decrease the number of visa branded card issued our payment volume and our revenue privacy data use and security continue to receive heightened legislative and regulatory focus in the united state and elsewhere for example in many jurisdiction consumer must be notified in the event of data breach and those jurisdiction who have these law are continuing to increase the circumstance and the breadth of these notice these measure may increase our and our client cost they may also decrease the number of visa branded card our client issue this would materially and adversely affect our profitability in addition our failure or the failure of our client to comply with these law and regulation could result in fine sanction litigation and damage to our global reputation and our brand evolving and increased global regulatory focus on the payment industry may result in costly new compliance burden on our client and on leading to increased cost and decreased payment volume and revenue regulation of the payment industry ha evolved and increased significantly example include data protection and information security aspect of our operation and business are subject to privacy and data protection regulation in the united state and elsewhere our financial institution client in the united state are subject to similar requirement under the guideline issued by the federal banking agency in addition many state have enacted legislation requiring consumer notification in the event of security breach regulatory compliance we are subject to anti money laundering law and regulation including the bank secrecy act amended including the usa patriot act of in addition we are also subject to the economic and trade sanction program administered by ofac that prohibit or restrict dealing with certain country their government and in certain circumstance their national well with of contentsspecifically designated individual and entity such narcotic trafficker terrorist and terrorist organization some of our client located outside of the united state may not be subject to these same law regulation and sanction and result may initiate transaction that while permissible in their country are not permissible in the united state we have policy procedure system and control in place to identify and address potentially impermissible transaction but in the event these control should fail we could be subject to penalty reputational damage and loss of business regulation of the price of credit many jurisdiction in which visa branded card are used have regulation that could increase the cost of card issuance or decrease the flexibility of issuer to charge market based interest rate and fee on credit card account these include the credit card act of in the united state and other proposed regulation under it proposed change to the truth in lending act of if implemented along with regulation required to be promulgated under the credit card act could result in decrease in our payment volume and revenue increased central bank oversight several central bank around the world have increased or are seeking to increase their formal oversight of the retail electronic payment industry in some case considering designating them systemically important payment system or critical infrastructure any such oversight may lead to additional regulation by central bank and other government regulator these could include new settlement procedure cyber security requirement or other operational rule to address credit and operational risk they could also include new criterion for financial institution client participation and merchant access to our payment system safety and soundness regulation recent banking regulation enacted in the united state and elsewhere may make some financial institution le attracted to becoming an issuer of visa branded card because they may be subject to increased risk management or higher capital requirement regulation of internet transaction proposed legislation in various jurisdiction may make it le desirable or more costly to complete internet transaction using visa branded card by affecting the legality of those transaction the law that govern the transaction their taxation or the allocation of various intellectual property right money transfer regulation we expand our product offering we may become subject to state money transfer regulation which could increase our regulatory oversight and compliance cost complying with these and other regulation increase our cost and can reduce our revenue opportunity our program and policy are designed to comply with anti money laundering anti terrorism and sanction regulation and we continue to review and enhance them but regulation continue to evolve and regulatory oversight continues to increase we can not guarantee that our program and policy will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authority the impact of such regulation on our client and on may increase compliance cost and reduce the volume of payment we process moreover such regulation can limit the type of product and service that we offer the country in which visa branded card are used and the type of account holder and merchant who can obtain or accept visa branded card any of these occurrence could materially and adversely affect our business prospect for future growth financial condition and result of operation litigation risk our retrospective responsibility plan may not adequately insulate from the impact of settlement or final judgment our retrospective responsibility plan address monetary liability from settlement of or final judgment in the covered litigation which is described in note retrospective responsibility plan to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report the retrospective responsibility plan consists of several related mechanism to fund settlement or judgment in the covered litigation these include an escrow account funded with portion of the net proceeds of our ipo and any subsequent offering of our share of class common stock or deposit of cash into the escrow account in lieu of such offering they also include loss sharing agreement and judgment sharing agreement in addition our financial institution client are obligated to indemnify pursuant to visa inc certificate of incorporation and bylaw and in accordance with their membership agreement these mechanism are unique complicated and tiered and if we can not use one or more of them this could have material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flow or even cause to become insolvent of contentsthe principal remaining covered litigation involves interchange reimbursement rate since approximately fifty five complaint all but thirteen of which were styled class action have been filed on behalf of merchant against mastercard and or other defendant including certain financial institution that issue visa branded payment card and acquire visa branded payment transaction in the united state we refer to this the interchange multidistrict litigation among other allegation the plaintiff have alleged that visa setting of default interchange reimbursement rate violated federal and state antitrust law the lawsuit were transferred to multidistrict litigation in the district court for the eastern district of new york the plaintiff in the interchange multidistrict litigation seek damage for alleged overcharge in merchant discount rate well injunctive and other relief the consolidated class action complaint alleges that the plaintiff estimate that damage will range in the ten of billion of dollar because these lawsuit were brought under the federal antitrust law any actual damage would be trebled the allocation of any monetary judgment or settlement among the defendant is governed by an omnibus agreement dated february see note retrospective responsibility plan and note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report visa portion of settlement or judgment covered by the omnibus agreement would be allocated in accordance with specified provision of our retrospective responsibility plan on october we signed settlement agreement in these case which included an agreement to pay approximately billion to the class plaintiff the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement agreement with the class plaintiff on november however the agreement with the class plaintiff remains subject to final court approval and the adjudication of any appeal we can not assure that the court will provide final approval of the settlement or that we will win any appeal on december visa paid approximately billion from the litigation escrow account into settlement fund established pursuant to the definitive class settlement agreement number of merchant have filed opt out case in various federal district court some of these case have already been transferred by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation for coordinated or consolidated pre trial proceeding to mdl and will be covered litigation under the retrospective responsibility plan it is possible that some opt out case may not be transferred or otherwise included in mdl and will not be covered litigation see note retrospective responsibility plan to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report failure of our retrospective responsibility plan to insulate adequately from the impact of such settlement or judgment could result in material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flow such failure could even cause to become insolvent the retrospective responsibility plan address only the covered litigation the plan generally doe not cover other pending litigation or any litigation that we may face in the future except for case that include claim for damage relating to the period prior to our ipo that are transferred for pre trial proceeding or otherwise included in the interchange multidistrict litigation see if we are found liable in other pending or future lawsuit we may have to pay substantial damage in addition non monetary settlement term and judgment in the covered litigation may require to modify the way we do business see limitation on our business resulting from litigation may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability therefore even if our retrospective responsibility plan provides with adequate funding to satisfy our obligation with respect to monetary liability from settlement of and judgment in the covered litigation it will not insulate from the monetary impact of pending or future litigation if we are found liable in other pending or future lawsuit we may have to pay substantial damage like many other large company we are defendant in number of civil action and investigation alleging violation of competition antitrust law consumer protection law or intellectual property law among others example of such claim are described more fully in note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report some lawsuit involve complex claim that are subject to substantial uncertainty and unspecified damage therefore we can not ascertain the probability of loss or estimate our liability accordingly we have not established allowance for such legal proceeding particularly in case involving merchant and consumer private plaintiff often seek class action certification in case against due to the size and scope of our business if we are found liable in large class action lawsuit such the or canadian merchant class action lawsuit monetary damage could be significant see note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report of contentsif we are unsuccessful in our defense against any material pending or future legal proceeding we may have to pay substantial damage this could result in material and adverse effect on our result of operation cash flow and financial condition and could even cause to become insolvent limitation on our business resulting from litigation may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability certain limitation have been placed on our business in recent year because of litigation we may also have to change our business practice in response to pending or future litigation for example under the settlement agreement in the interchange multidistrict litigation we have agreed among other thing to permit merchant to add surcharge to credit transaction in certain circumstance these and other settlement of or judgment in past pending and future litigation could force to limit the rate we charge revise our rule about rate charged to consumer who use visa branded payment product or make other modification to our business these modification could materially and adversely affect our payment volume revenue operating result prospect for future growth and overall business tax examination or dispute or change in the tax law applicable to could materially increase our tax payment we exercise significant judgment in calculating our worldwide provision for income tax and other tax liability although we believe our tax estimate are reasonable many factor may decrease their accuracy we are currently under examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authority and we may be subject to additional examination in the future relevant tax authority may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material item and thereby increase our tax liability failure to sustain our position in these matter could result in material adverse effect on our cash flow and financial position in addition change in existing law such recent proposal for fundamental and international tax reform may also increase our effective tax rate substantial increase in our tax burden could have material adverse effect on our financial result see also note income tax to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report we have limited right to enforce our agreement with visa europe which includes indemnity obligation that could expose to significant liability in the event visa europe fails to meet it obligation under the framework agreement our remedy are limited we are unable to terminate the agreement even upon visa europe material uncured breach we also have call option to acquire visa europe which can be triggered only under extremely limited circumstance see note visa europe to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report visa europe is obligated to indemnify visa inc and visa international service association visa international in connection with the european competition proceeding in our opinion including payment of any fine that may be imposed however visa europe ha expressed an initial view that it is not obligated to indemnify visa inc or visa international for any claim in the european competition proceeding including claim asserted in both the european commission matter and the merchant litigation if visa europe continues in it refusal to indemnify and we can not enforce the indemnity we could be exposed to significant liability which would not be covered under our retrospective responsibility plan see note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report in addition under the framework agreement we may be required to indemnify visa europe for loss resulting from all claim outside it region arising from our or their action relating to the payment business this obligation applies even if neither we any of our related party or agent engaged in the action giving rise to such claim the indemnity obligation could expose to significant liability for activity over which we have little or no control our retrospective responsibility plan would not cover these liability business risk the intense pressure we face on client pricing may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profit in order to stay competitive we offer incentive to client to increase payment volume enter new market segment and expand their visa branded card base these include up front cash payment fee discount credit performance based incentive marketing and other support payment we have continued to increase the use of incentive such up front cash payment and fee discount in many country including the united state in of contentsaddition we offer incentive to certain merchant or acquirer to win routing in situation where our product are co resident with other network and merchant have choice of network routing option the economic pressure on our client arising from the dodd frank act have also increased our use of incentive see the dodd frank act may continue to have material adverse impact on our financial condition revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business result the provision of certain product and service may be le profitable or unprofitable which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profit pressure on client pricing also pose additional challenge for our business if we continue to increase incentive to our client we will need to find way to offset the financial impact by increasing payment volume increasing the amount of fee based service we provide or both we may not succeed in so particularly in the current regulatory environment in addition we benefit from long term contract with certain client including those that are large contributor to our revenue continued pressure on our fee could prevent from maintaining such agreement in the future on the same or favorable term we may also have to modify existing agreement in order to maintain relationship or comply with regulation finally increased pricing pressure enhances the importance of cost containment and productivity initiative in area other than those surrounding client incentive and we may not succeed in these effort intense competition in our industry may cause our business financial condition result of operation and prospect for future growth to suffer the global payment industry is intensely competitive our payment program compete against all form of payment these include cash check and electronic and mobile transaction in addition our open loop payment network competes against other alternate payment system such closed loop system the dodd frank act ha increased this competitive pressure some of our competitor may develop substantially greater technology or have greater financial resource they may offer wider range of program product and service than we do including more innovative one they may use advertising and marketing strategy that are more effective than ours achieving broader brand recognition and merchant acceptance they may also develop better security solution or more favorable pricing arrangement certain of our competitor operate with different business model have different cost structure or participate selectively in different market segment these include domestic network in the united state china canada and australia they may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to new regulatory technological and other development in many case these competitor have the support of government mandate that prohibit limit or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for or otherwise secure transaction within those country and region traditional or nontraditional competitor may put at competitive disadvantage by leveraging service or product in area in which we do not directly compete to win business in area where we do compete our client can reassess their commitment to at any time or develop their own competitive service the risk to maintaining or securing our client long term commitment to our product ha increased with the dodd frank act restriction on network exclusivity in the debit sector we do not have exclusivity with our largest client such jpmorgan chase and bank of america in certain circumstance our client may terminate these relationship on relatively short notice despite significant early termination fee because significant portion of our operating revenue is concentrated among our largest client our operating revenue would decline significantly if we lost one or more of our client this could have material adverse impact on our business financial condition and result of operation see note enterprise wide disclosure and concentration of business to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report we expect there to be change in the competitive landscape in the future for example competitor client and others may develop product that compete with or replace the value added service we provide to support our transaction processing party that process our transaction in certain country may try to eliminate our position in the payment value chain we may be asked to develop or customize certain aspect of our payment service for use by our customer processor or other third party of content participant in the payment industry may merge form joint venture or enter into other business combination that strengthen their existing business proposition or create new competing payment service competition may increase from alternate type of payment service such mobile payment service ecommerce payment service and service that permit direct debit of consumer checking account or ach payment or new player and intermediary in the value chain may direct the payment decision making or impair the value of the service we provide our failure to compete effectively in light of any such development could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition revenue result of operation and prospect for future growth disintermediation from the payment value chain would harm our business our position in the payment value chain is key to our business some of our competitor including american express discover private label card network and certain alternate payment system operate closed loop payment system with direct connection to both merchant and consumer without any intermediary these competitor seek to derive competitive advantage from this business model regulatory action such the dodd frank act may provide them with increased opportunity to do so in addition although other competitor are pursuing similar line of business or adopting similar commercial model they have not attracted the same level of legal or regulatory scrutiny of their pricing and business practice operator of multi party payment system such ours we also run the risk of disintermediation by virtue of increasing bilateral agreement between entity that would rather not use payment network for processing payment for example merchant could process transaction directly with issuer or processor could process transaction directly between issuer and acquirer additional consolidation in the banking industry could result in losing business and create pressure on the fee we charge our client which could materially and adversely affect our business revenue result of operation and prospect for future growth additional consolidation in the banking industry may result in the acquisition of one or more of our largest client by an institution with strong relationship with one of our competitor or with one of our competitor directly this could result in the acquired financial institution visa business shifting to competitor resulting in substantial loss of business to additional consolidation in the banking industry could also reduce the overall number of new and existing client and could increase their negotiating power this consolidation could lead new financial institution client to seek greater pricing discount or other incentive with in addition more consolidation could prompt our existing client to seek to renegotiate their pricing agreement with to obtain more favorable term we may also be adversely affected by price compression should one of our client absorb another financial institution and qualify for higher volume based discount on the combined volume of the merged business pressure on the fee we charge our client caused by such consolidation could materially and adversely affect our business revenue result of operation and prospect for future growth merchant continued focus on the cost associated with payment card acceptance may result in more litigation regulation regulatory enforcement incentive arrangement and other initiative we rely in part on merchant and their relationship with our client to maintain and expand the acceptance of visa branded payment card consolidation in the retail industry is producing group of larger merchant that is significant impact on all participant in the global payment industry some merchant have sought to reduce their cost associated with payment card acceptance by lobbying for new legislation and regulatory enforcement and by filing lawsuit if they continue we may face increased compliance and litigation expense we also face competitive pressure on pricing we and our client negotiate pricing discount and other incentive arrangement with certain large merchant to increase acceptance and usage of visa branded payment card if merchant continue to consolidate we and our client may have to increase the incentive provided to certain larger merchant some merchant also continue to invest in their own payment solution using both traditional and new technology platform example include closed loop payment system that are specific to single merchant or multi merchant solution like the merchant customer exchange which is designed for mobile of contentsplatform and ha many merchant participant such program may offer unique or specialized benefit to consumer including discount or customized offer if merchant are able to drive broad consumer adoption and usage it could adversely impact our transaction volume all of these factor could materially and adversely affect our revenue result of operation prospect for future growth and overall business competitive and regulatory pressure on pricing could make it difficult to offset the cost of these incentive certain financial institution have exclusive or nearly exclusive relationship with our competitor to issue payment card and these relationship may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenue certain financial institution have longstanding exclusive or nearly exclusive relationship with our competitor to issue payment card these relationship may make it difficult or cost prohibitive for to conduct material amount of business with them in addition these financial institution may be more successful and may grow more quickly than our existing client which could put at competitive disadvantage and prevent from growing our business and revenue failure to maintain relationship with issuer acquirer merchant and account holder and the failure of our financial institution client to provide service on our behalf could materially and adversely affect our business we depend and will continue to depend significantly on relationship with our financial institution client and on their relationship with account holder and merchant to support and to compete effectively for our program and service we do not issue card extend credit to account holder or determine the interest rate or other fee charged to account holder using card that carry our brand each issuer determines these competitive card feature for their customer in the wake of the dodd frank act change to the network exclusivity rule we have engaged and will continue to engage in significantly more discussion with merchant acquirer and processor we already engage in many co branding effort in which we contract with merchant who directly receive incentive funding from we also engage with merchant acquirer and processor to provide funding to promote routing and acceptance growth these and other relationship become more prevalent and take on greater importance to our business our success will increasingly depend on our ability to sustain and grow these relationship outside the united state some government only permit their domestic processing which prohibits from overseeing the end to end processing of the transaction therefore we depend on our close working relationship with our client in these region to effectively manage the processing of transaction involving visa branded card our inability to oversee the end to end processing for card carrying our brand in these country may put at competitive disadvantage by limiting our ability to ensure the quality of the service supporting our brand in addition we depend on third party to provide various service associated with our payment network on our behalf and to the extent that such third party vendor fail to perform or deliver adequate service our business and reputation could be impaired negative perception of our company in the marketplace may affect our brand and reputation which are key asset of our business our brand and their attribute are key asset of our business the ability to attract and retain account holder and financial institution client to visa branded product depends highly upon the external perception of our company and our industry quality of service corporate responsibility use and protection of account holder data regulatory compliance financial condition and other factor negative perception or publicity particularly in light of the rapid widespread use of social medium channel could cause damage to our brand and reputation our business may also be affected by action taken by our client other third party or circumstance that are outside our control our client may take action that we do not believe to be in the best interest of our brand such adverse creditor practice our limited control over the quality of service and promotion of our brand in europe could affect our brand and reputation globally while visa europe ha broad latitude to use our brand and of contentstechnology within it region visa europe is not required to spend any minimum amount of money conducting research on brand performance promoting or maintaining the strength of our brand we may be associated with adverse development with respect to our industry and with new rule and regulation concerning human right condition our corporate responsibility regarding those condition and resulting disclosure requirement any negative perception of the united state arising from it political economic social or other position could harm the perception of our company and our brand globally by associating visa with those position any of these factor could require to take on additional liability and cost result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny and materially and adversely affect our revenue operating result prospect for future growth and overall business unprecedented economic event in financial market around the world have affected and are likely to continue to affect our client merchant and account holder and may potentially impact our prospect profitability revenue and overall business the current threat to economic growth include geopolitical instability in the middle east which could affect oil price economic fragility in the eurozone and in the united state potential reduction or tapering of bond purchase by the federal reserve higher interest rate hurting the housing market persistently weak job creation political discord spending cut and debt default while there continues to be some improvement in advanced economy emerging economy continue to suffer with slower growth consumer spending continues to be impacted from consumer debt level excess housing inventory deflation change in saving rate continued equity market volatility decreased export activity lowered government spending and additional government intervention furthermore continued challenge in the credit environment bank instability downgrade of sovereign bank and commercial debt political issue affecting the handling of national debt and the uncertainty arising from new government policy all must be considered the fragility of the current situation would be exacerbated if additional negative economic development or crisis were to arise around the world these include default on government debt exhaustion of national economic stimulus package significant increase in oil price tax increase significant decline in the commercial real estate market and policy misstep most recently the economic situation in the united state and various country in europe have been particularly unstable arising from the real prospect of debt default if such default occur or if the measure taken to avert such default create their own instability economic turmoil is likely to result and the impact is likely to be global and highly significant the volatility of the current economic environment in advanced and emerging economy and the response by financial institution and government may create new risk or increase the impact of existing one these include the following depressed consumer and business confidence may continue to decrease account holder spending uncertainty and volatility in the performance of our client business may reduce the accuracy of our estimate of our revenue rebate incentive and realization of prepaid asset our client may implement cost reduction initiative that reduce or eliminate payment card marketing budget or increase request for greater incentive or reduced fee from which may reduce our revenue our client may decrease spending for optional or enhanced service affecting our revenue and reducing account holder desire to use these product our client may increase account holder fee cost recovery initiative or result of regulatory action decreasing their value proposition to consumer and reducing consumer desire to use our product government intervention or investment in our client may negatively affect our business with those institution or otherwise alter their business decision of content tightening of credit availability could affect the ability of participating financial institution to lend to under the term of our credit facility the government inability to meet it obligation or possible further downgrade in the debt rating could adversely affect the liquidity of our investment substantial portion of which are in treasury and government security our client may default on their settlement obligation including for reason unrelated to payment card activity such mortgage loan commitment adverse fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate could negatively affect the dollar value of our revenue and payment in foreign currency the current economic environment could lead some client to curtail or postpone near term investment in growing their card portfolio limit credit line modify fee and loyalty program or take other action that adversely affect the growth of our volume and revenue stream from these client decline in stock price or significant instability could cause consumer spending to decline materially any of these development could have material adverse impact on our prospect growth revenue profitability and overall business decline in non and cross border activity and in multi currency transaction could adversely affect our revenue and profitability we generate significant portion of our revenue from such transaction we generate significant amount of our revenue from cross border transaction and our client pay fee in connection with them some of those fee differ when conversion from the merchant currency to the issuer billing currency is required thus revenue from processing cross border transaction for our client fluctuates with cross border activity and the need for transaction to be converted into different currency in addition visa derives revenue from foreign currency exchange activity that result from our client settlement in different currency reduction in multi currency transaction may reduce the need for foreign currency exchange activity and adversely affect our revenue limitation or change in our ability to set foreign currency exchange rate for multi currency transaction result of regulation litigation competitive pressure or other reason may also adversely affect our revenue cross border travel may be adversely affected by global geopolitical economic social and other condition these include the threat of terrorism social or political instability natural disaster effect of climate change and outbreak of disease the need for conversion of currency decline cross border travel is impacted which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability moreover if our client decide to change practice prohibit certain transaction or increase account holder fee associated with cross border transaction there could be decline in account holder spending because their value proposition to the consumer could be reduced transaction outside the united state represent an increasingly important part of our strategy which we hope will continue to grow however decline in non and cross border activity and multi currency transaction will decrease the number of cross border transaction we process and our revenue and profitability may be materially and adversely affected we risk loss or insolvency if our client fail to fund settlement obligation for which we have provided indemnification we indemnify issuer and acquirer for any settlement loss they suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to fund it settlement obligation in certain instance we may indemnify issuer or acquirer even in situation in which transaction is not processed by our system this indemnification creates settlement risk for due to the difference in timing between the date of payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement while the term and amount of our indemnification obligation have no limit our exposure under the indemnification is restricted to the amount of unsettled visa payment transaction at any point in time concurrent settlement failure involving more than one of our largest client several of our smaller client or systemic operational failure lasting more than single day could cause to exceed our available financial resource any such failure could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and result of of contentsoperations in addition even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover settlement failure we may be unable to recover the amount of such payment this could expose to significant loss and materially and adversely affect our financial condition result of operation and cash flow we estimate settlement exposure under the indemnity based on the sum of three input the first is average daily volume during the quarter multiplied by the estimated number of day to settle plus safety margin the second is four month of rolling average chargebacks volume the third is the total balance for outstanding visa traveler cheque we generally guarantee the payment of any validly issued visa traveler cheque that ha been negotiated in good faith and properly presented for payment in the event that the cheque is not honored by it issuing institution additionally from time to time we review and revise our risk management methodology and input necessary see note settlement guarantee management to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report some of our client are composed of group of financial institution some of these client have elected to limit their responsibility for settlement loss arising from the failure of their constituent financial institution in exchange for managing their constituent financial institution in accordance with our credit risk policy to the extent that any settlement failure resulting from constituent financial institution exceeds the limit established by our credit risk policy we would have to absorb the cost of such settlement failure which could materially and adversely affect our cash flow if we can not keep pace with rapid technological development to provide new and innovative payment program and service or with new law and regulation the use of our product our revenue and net income could decline rapid significant technological change continue to confront the payment industry these include development in smart card ecommerce mobile and radio frequency and proximity payment device such contactless card we can not predict the effect of technological change on our business in addition to our own initiative and innovation we rely in part on third party including some of our competitor for the development of and access to new technology we expect that new service and technology applicable to the payment industry will continue to emerge these new service and technology may be superior to or render obsolete the technology we currently use in our product and service in addition our ability to adopt new service and technology that we develop may be inhibited by industry wide standard new law and regulation resistance to change from client or merchant or third party intellectual property right our success will depend in part on our ability to develop new technology and adapt to technological change and evolving industry standard if our transaction processing system are disrupted or compromised the perception of our brand and our revenue or operating result could be materially and adversely affected our transaction processing system may experience service interruption or degradation because of processing or other technology malfunction fire natural disaster power loss disruption in long distance or local telecommunication access fraud military or political conflict terrorist attack effect of climate change or other catastrophic event in addition our visibility in the global payment industry may attract terrorist and hacker to conduct physical or computer based attack the latter could include computer virus worm or other destructive or disruptive software process breakdown denial of service attack malicious social engineering or other malicious activity or any combination of the foregoing any of these incident could result in degradation or disruption of our service or damage to our property equipment and data they could also compromise data security see account data breach involving card or other data processed stored or transmitted by third party or by could adversely affect our reputation and revenue if such attack are not detected immediately their effect could be compounded finally potential and actual attack could also result in increased cost both for recovery and for prevention against future attack additionally we rely on service provider for the timely transmission of information across our global data network if service provider fails to provide the communication capacity or service we require because of natural disaster operational disruption terrorism or any other reason the failure could interrupt our service because of the centrality of our processing system to our business any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of our brand reliability and materially reduce our revenue or profitability of contentsaccount data breach involving card or other data processed stored or transmitted by third party or by could adversely affect our reputation and revenue our client merchant other service provider and we process store or transmit account holder information in connection with visa branded card and payment product in addition our client may use third party processor to process transaction generated by card carrying our brand breach of the system processing storing or transmission of sensitive account holder data and other information could lead to fraudulent activity involving visa branded card reputational damage and claim against if we are sued in connection with any material data security breach we could be involved in protracted litigation if unsuccessful in defending such lawsuit we may have to pay damage or change our business practice or pricing structure any of which could have material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability in addition any reputational damage resulting from an account data breach at one or more of our client merchant or other third party could decrease the use and acceptance of visa branded card which could have material adverse impact on our payment volume revenue and future growth prospect finally any data security breach could result in additional regulation which could materially increase our compliance cost an increase in fraudulent or other illegal activity involving visa branded card or payment product could lead to reputational damage to our brand and reduce the use and acceptance of visa branded card or payment product criminal are using increasingly sophisticated method to capture account holder information they use this information to conduct fraudulent transaction and to engage in other form of illegal activity involving our payment product outsourcing and specialization of function within the payment system are increasing result more third party are involved in processing transaction using visa branded card or payment product rise in fraud level and other illegal activity involving visa branded card or payment product could lead to reputational damage to our brand this could reduce the use and acceptance of visa branded card and payment product or lead to greater regulation which could increase our compliance cost and materially and adversely affect our payment volume and revenue failure to maintain interoperability with visa europe system could damage the business and global perception of the visa brand visa and visa europe maintain mostly separate authorization clearing and settlement system result we have to ensure that the two system can process every transaction involving both of our territory regardless of where it originates visa europe independent system operation could present challenge to our business due to increasing cost and difficulty in maintaining the interoperability of our respective system any inconsistency in the payment processing service and product between visa europe and could negatively affect account holder from visa europe using payment product in the country we serve or our account holder using payment product in visa europe region failure to authorize clear and settle inter territory transaction quickly and accurately could harm our business and impair the global perception of our brand structural and organizational risk due to the nature of our relationship and the term we have agreed to with visa europe we have little ability to control it operation in it region and result we may experience added cost and challenge in operating our business visa europe exclusive license of our trademark and technology under the framework agreement give little ability to control and oversee visa europe operation in it region if we want to change global rule or to implement certain change that may be viewed unfavorable to visa europe and it member visa europe is not required to implement the change unless we agree to pay for the associated cost this may result in added cost and expense to our business furthermore the license granted under the framework agreement may raise licensing payment and associated tax treatment concern visa europe may hinder our ability to acquire new business or to operate them effectively in it region if the acquired business ha operation in visa europe region visa europe may play significant part in influencing our ongoing operational decision and cost there finally visa europe may undertake operational and litigation strategy including but not limited to our ongoing litigation in the and our ongoing case with the european commission that may adversely impact our business and reputation globally if visa europe make acquire all of it outstanding stock under it put option we are likely to incur substantial cost and may suffer material and adverse effect on our operation and net income of contentswe have granted visa europe put option which visa europe can exercise at any time and which would require to purchase all outstanding capital stock from visa europe member within day we are likely to incur financial obligation of several billion dollar or more and may need to obtain third party financing in order to meet our obligation through the issuance of either debt or equity an equity offering or the payment of part of the exercise price with our stock would dilute the ownership interest of our stockholder sufficient financing might not be available to within that time on reasonable term see note visa europe to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report we may also encounter difficulty in integrating visa europe business and system into our existing operation if we can not do so quickly and cost effectively the integration could divert the time and resource of senior management disrupt our current operation and adversely affect our result of operation in addition we would become subject to any ongoing or future regulatory dispute result of eu regulation that govern the operation of visa europe we are required to record any change in the fair value of the put option on quarterly basis we record these adjustment through our consolidated statement of operation consequently the adjustment affect our reported net income and earnings per share these quarterly adjustment and their resulting impact on our reported statement of operation could be significant the existence of these change in the fair value of the put option could adversely affect our ability to raise capital and increase any associated cost if we can not remain organizationally effective we will be unable to address the opportunity and challenge presented by our strategy and the increasingly challenging competitive economic and regulatory environment we continue to centralize our management and operation for to succeed organizationally we must effectively integrate our operation actively work to ensure consistency throughout our enterprise and incorporate global perspective into our decision and process if we fail to do so we may be unable to expand rapidly we plan and the result of our expansion may be unsatisfactory in addition if we are unable to make decision quickly ass our risk execute our strategy and implement new governance managerial and organizational process needed we may not be successful in this competitive economic and regulatory environment we may be unable to attract and retain key management and other key employee our employee particularly our key management are vital to our success and difficult to replace we may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employee particularly if we do not offer employment term competitive with the rest of the market failure to attract and retain highly qualified employee or failure to develop and implement viable succession plan could result in inadequate depth of

income will be the result of negotiation between and visa europe the put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two party are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price the fair value of the put option represents the value of visa europe option which under certain condition could obligate to purchase it member equity interest for an amount above fair value at september we determined the fair value of the put option liability to be approximately million while this amount represents the fair value of the put option at september it doe not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised the purchase price we could be obligated to pay day after exercise will represent substantial financial obligation which could be several billion dollar or more we may of contentsneed to obtain third party financing either by borrowing fund or undertaking subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment the amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on among other thing visa europe adjusted sustainable income and our ratio in each case negotiated at the time the put option is exercised given the perpetual nature of the put option and the various economic condition which could be present at the time of exercise our ultimate obligation in the event of exercise can not be reliably estimated the following table calculates our total obligation assuming for illustrative purpose only range of ratio for visa inc and assuming that visa europe demonstrates million of adjusted sustainable income at the date of exercise the million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below is for illustrative purpose only this doe not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income visa europe would have been able to demonstrate at september or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future should visa europe elect to exercise it option we believe it is likely that it will implement change in it business operation to move to for profit model in order to maximize it adjusted sustainable income and result to increase the purchase price the table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout assuming the same range of estimated ratio for each million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed million demonstrated at the time of exercise at september our estimated long term ratio wa and the long term differential the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to visa europe wa at september the spot ratio wa and the spot differential the difference between this ratio and the estimated spot ratio applicable to visa europe wa these ratio are for reference purpose only and are not necessarily indicative of the ratio or differential that could be applicable if the put option were exercised at any point in the future visa inc forwardprice to earnings ratio payout assumingadjusted sustainableincome of million increase decrease in payoutfor each million ofadjusted sustainableincome above below million in million in million given the large range of different economic environment and circumstance under which visa europe could decide to exercise it option the ultimate purchase price could be several billion dollar or more pension and other postretirement benefit we sponsor various qualified and non qualified defined benefit pension plan that generally provide benefit based on year of service age and eligible compensation we also sponsor postretirement benefit plan that provides postretirement medical benefit for retiree and dependent upon meeting minimum age and service requirement our policy with respect to our qualified pension plan is to contribute annually not le than the minimum required under the employee retirement income security act our non qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plan are funded on current basis we typically fund our qualified pension plan in september of each year in fiscal and we made contribution to our pension and other postretirement plan of million million and million respectively the lower contribution in fiscal wa driven by higher than expected rate of return on our plan asset during the year and an increase in the discount rate at september compared to september in fiscal given current projection and assumption we anticipate funding our defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement plan by approximately million the actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan movement in the discount rate performance of the plan asset and related tax consequence see note pension postretirement and other benefit to our consolidated financial statement capital expenditure our capital expenditure increased during fiscal due to investment in technology infrastructure and growth initiative we expect to continue investing in technology asset and payment system infrastructure to support our core business well our ecommerce and mobile initiative acquisition there were no material acquisition during fiscal and compared to fiscal when we acquired playspan and fundamo for total of million net of million in cash received we will continue to pursue our growth initiative and to expand our product offering through acquisition and strategic partnership in the future of contentsfair value measurement financial instrument the assessment of fair value of our financial instrument is based on fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable input and minimize the use of unobservable input when measuring fair value observable input are obtained from independent source and can be validated by third party whereas unobservable input reflect assumption regarding third party would use in pricing an asset or liability of september our financial instrument measured at fair value on recurring basis included approximately billion of asset and million of liability of these instrument million or had significant unobservable input including the visa europe put option liability of million and million of auction rate security see note fair value measurement and investment to our consolidated financial statement balance sheet arrangement our off balance sheet arrangement are primarily comprised of guarantee and indemnification visa ha no off balance sheet debt other than lease and purchase order commitment discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligation table indemnification we indemnify client for settlement loss suffered due to the failure of any other client to honor visa branded card and payment product processed in accordance with our operating regulation the amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled visa payment transaction at any point in time we maintain global credit settlement risk policy and procedure to manage settlement risk which may require client to post collateral if certain credit standard are not met see note summary of significant accounting policy and note settlement guarantee management to our consolidated financial statement in the ordinary course of business we enter into contractual arrangement with financial institution and other client under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain type of loss incurred relating to the service we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement contractual obligation our contractual commitment will have an impact on our future liquidity the contractual obligation identified in the table below include both on and off balance sheet transaction that represent material expected or contractually committed future obligation of september we believe that we will be able to fund these obligation through cash generated from our operation and available credit facility payment due by period le year more year total in million purchase order incentive and sponsorship represents agreement to purchase good and service that specify significant term including fixed or minimum quantity to be purchased and fixed minimum or variable price provision and the approximate timing of the transaction includes operating lease for premise equipment and software license which range in term from one to eighteen year represents future cash payment for long term contract with financial institution client and other business partner for various program designed to build payment volume increase visa branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transaction over our network these agreement which range in term from one to thirteen year can provide card issuance and or conversion support volume growth target and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirement payment under these agreement will generally be offset by revenue earned from higher corresponding payment and transaction volume these payment amount are estimate and will change based on client performance amendment to of contentsexisting contract or execution of new contract related amount disclosed in note commitment and contingency to our consolidated financial statement represent the associated expected reduction of revenue related to these agreement that we estimate we will record visa is party to contractual sponsorship agreement ranging from approximately three to sixteen year these contract are designed to help increase visa branded card and volume over the life of these contract visa is required to make payment in exchange for certain advertising and promotional right in connection with these contractual commitment visa ha an obligation to spend certain minimum amount for advertising and marketing promotion over the life of the contract for obligation where the individual year of spend are not specified in the contract we have estimated the timing of when these amount will be spent includes expected dividend amount of million dividend were declared in october and will be paid on december to all holder of record of visa common stock of november we have liability for uncertain tax position of million at september we also accrued million of interest and million of penalty associated with our uncertain tax position we can not determine the range of cash payment that will be made and the timing of the cash settlement if any associated with our uncertain tax position therefore no amount related to these obligation have been included in the table visa granted perpetual put option to visa europe which if exercised will require to purchase all of the outstanding share of capital stock of visa europe from it member due to the perpetual nature of the instrument and the various economic condition which could exist when the put is exercised the ultimate amount and timing of visa obligation if any can not be reliably estimated therefore no amount related to this obligation have been included in the table however given the range of different economic environment and circumstance under which visa europe could exercise it option the ultimate purchase price could be several billion dollar or more the fair value of the visa europe put option totaling million at september ha also been excluded from this table it doe not represent the amount or an estimate of the amount of visa obligation in the event of exercise see the liquidity and capital resource and critical accounting estimate section of this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation and note visa europe to our consolidated financial statement we evaluate the need to make contribution to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan movement in the discount rate performance of the plan asset and related tax consequence expected contribution to our pension plan have not been included in the table such amount are dependent upon the consideration discussed above and may result in wide range of amount see note pension postretirement and other benefit to our consolidated financial statement and the liquidity and capital resource section of this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation critical accounting estimate our consolidated financial statement are prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state of america which require to make judgment assumption and estimate that affect the amount reported see note summary of significant accounting policy to our consolidated financial statement we have established policy and control procedure which seek to ensure that estimate and assumption are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period however actual result could differ from our assumption and estimate and such difference could be material we believe that the following accounting estimate are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial result they require our most subjective or complex management judgment resulting from the need to make estimate about the effect of matter that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable revenue recognition client incentive critical estimate we enter into incentive agreement with financial institution client and other business partner for various program designed to build payment volume increase visa branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transaction over our network these incentive are primarily accounted for reduction to operating revenue however if separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established they are accounted for operating expense we generally capitalize advance incentive payment under these agreement if select criterion are met the capitalization criterion include the existence of future economic benefit to visa the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language early termination clause management ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amount deferred capitalized amount are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit incentive not yet paid are accrued of contentssystematically and rationally based on management estimate of each client performance these accrual are regularly reviewed and estimate of performance are adjusted appropriate based on change in performance expectation actual client performance amendment to existing contract or the execution of new contract assumption and judgment estimation of client incentive relies on forecast of payment volume card issuance and card conversion performance is estimated using customer reported information transactional information accumulated from our system historical information and discussion with our client impact if actual result differ from assumption if our client actual performance or recoverable cash flow are not consistent with our estimate client incentive may be materially different than initially recorded increase in incentive payment are generally driven by increased payment and transaction volume which drive our net revenue result in the event incentive payment exceed estimate such payment are not expected to have material effect on our financial condition result of operation or cash flow the cumulative impact of revision in estimate is recorded in the period such revision become probable and estimable for the year ended september client incentive represented of gross operating revenue fair value visa europe put option critical estimate we have granted visa europe perpetual put option which if exercised will require to purchase all of the outstanding share of capital stock of visa europe from it member the put option provides formula for determining the purchase price of the visa europe share which subject to certain adjustment applies our forward price to earnings multiple or the ratio defined in the option agreement at the time the option is exercised to visa europe projected adjusted sustainable income for the forward month period or the adjusted sustainable income defined in the option agreement the calculation of visa europe adjusted sustainable income under the term of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustment for cost synergy and other negotiated item upon exercise the key input to this formula including visa europe adjusted sustainable income will be the result of negotiation between and visa europe the put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two party are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price see note visa europe to our consolidated financial statement for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the agreement the fair value of visa europe option wa estimated to be approximately million at september while the put option is in fact non transferable this amount recorded in our financial statement represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay third party market participant to transfer the potential obligation in an orderly transaction the fair value of the put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price under the term of the put agreement to the estimated fair value of visa europe the fair value of visa europe is defined the estimated amount third party market participant might pay in an arm length transaction under normal business condition probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that visa europe will never exercise it option while this amount represents the fair value of the put option at september it doe not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised which could be several billion dollar or more see the liquidity and capital resource section of management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation for further discussion assumption and judgment the most significant estimate used in the valuation of the put option are the assumed probability that visa europe will elect to exercise it option and the estimated differential between the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock defined in the put option agreement and that applicable to visa europe on stand alone basis at the time of exercise which we refer to the differential probability of exercise exercise of the put option is at the sole discretion of visa europe on behalf of the visa europe shareholder pursuant to authority granted to visa europe under it article of association we estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including but not limited to visa europe stated intention ii indication that visa europe is preparing to exercise reflected in it reported financial result iii evaluation of market condition including the regulatory environment that could impact the potential future profitability of visa europe and iv qualitative factor applicable to visa europe largest member which could indicate change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holding of contentsp differential the differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock defined in the put option agreement and that applicable to visa europe at the time of exercise for valuation purpose the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measure and qualitative factor quantitatively we estimate our ratio by dividing the average stock price over the preceding month the long term calculation and the last trading date the day calculation prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the month starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date this median earnings estimate is obtained from the institutional broker estimate system we then determine the best estimate of our long term price to earnings multiple for valuation purpose by qualitatively evaluating the day calculation compared to the long term calculation in this evaluation we examine both measure to determine whether difference if any are the result of fundamental change in our long term value or the result of short term market volatility or other non company specific market factor that may not be indicative of our long term forward we believe given the perpetual nature of the put option that market participant would more heavily weigh long term value indicator opposed to short term indicator factor that might indicate fundamental change in long term value include but are not limited to change in the regulatory environment client portfolio long term growth rate or new product innovation consistent methodology is applied to group of comparable public company used to estimate the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to visa europe these estimate therefore are impacted by change in stock price and the financial market expectation of our future earnings and those of comparable company other estimate of lesser significance include growth rate and foreign currency exchange rate applied in the calculation of visa europe adjusted sustainable income the valuation model assumes large range of annual growth rate reflecting the different economic environment and circumstance under which visa europe could decide to exercise it option the lowest growth rate assumed reflect visa europe current business model an association owned by it member bank while the highest reflect successful shift to for profit model in anticipation of it exercise the scenario with higher growth rate are assigned significantly higher probability in the valuation model we believe market participant would more heavily weigh these scenario it is likely that should it choose to exercise it option visa europe will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting for profit business model in advance of exercising the put option the foreign exchange rate used to translate visa europe result from euro to dollar reflects blend of forward exchange rate observed in the marketplace the assumed timing of exercise of the put option used in the various modeled scenario is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation obligation calculated in later year are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value impact if actual result differ from assumption in the determination of the fair value of the put option at september we have assumed probability of exercise by visa europe at some point in the future and an estimated long term differential at the time of exercise of approximately the use of probability of exercise that is higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in the value of the put option an increase of in the assumed differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in the value of the put option the put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of visa europe such the put option liability is included in accrued liability in our consolidated balance sheet at september classification in current liability is not an indication of management expectation of exercise and simply reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within month legal and regulatory matter critical estimate we are currently involved in various legal proceeding the outcome of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged period of time management is required to ass the probability of loss and amount of such loss if any in preparing our financial statement assumption and judgment we evaluate the likelihood of potential loss from legal or regulatory proceeding to which we are party we record liability for such claim when loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgment are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceeding the merit of our defense and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claim and may revise our estimate of contentsour retrospective responsibility plan only address monetary liability from settlement of or final judgment in the covered litigation the plan mechanism include the use of the litigation escrow account the accrual related to the covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance we not record an accrual for the covered litigation during fiscal see note retrospective responsibility plan and note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement impact if actual result differ from assumption due to the inherent uncertainty of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdiction in which we operate our judgment may be materially different than the actual outcome which could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation see note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement income tax critical estimate in calculating our effective income tax rate we make judgment regarding certain tax position including the timing and amount of deduction and allocation of income among various tax jurisdiction assumption and judgment we have various tax filing position with regard to the timing and amount of deduction and credit the establishment of liability for uncertain tax position and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdiction we are also required to inventory evaluate and measure all uncertain tax position taken or to be taken on tax return and to record liability for the amount of such position that may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority impact if actual result differ from assumption although we believe that our estimate and judgment are reasonable actual result may differ from these estimate some or all of these judgment are subject to review by the taxing authority if one or more of the taxing authority were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded and we were unable to realize this benefit it could have material and adverse effect on our financial result and cash flow item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskmarket risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse change in market factor our exposure to financial market risk result primarily from fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate interest rate and equity price aggregate risk exposure are monitored on an ongoing basis foreign currency exchange rate riskalthough most of our activity are transacted in dollar we are exposed to adverse fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation are primarily related to adverse change in the dollar value of revenue generated from foreign currency denominated transaction and adverse change in the dollar value of payment in foreign currency primarily for expense at our non location we manage these risk by entering into foreign currency forward contract that hedge exposure of the variability in the dollar equivalent of anticipated non dollar denominated cash flow our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces but doe not entirely eliminate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movement the aggregate notional amount of our foreign currency forward contract outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program including contract not designated for cash flow hedge accounting were billion and million at september and respectively the aggregate notional amount outstanding at september is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below predetermined and approved threshold however actual result could materially differ from our forecast the effect of hypothetical change in the value of the dollar is estimated to create an additional fair value gain or loss of approximately million on our foreign currency forward contract outstanding at september see note summary of significant accounting policy and note derivative financial instrument to our consolidated financial statement we are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activity this risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with client relative to the timing of market trade for balancing currency position risk in settlement activity is limited through daily operating procedure including the utilization of visa settlement system and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties of contentsinterest rate riskour investment portfolio asset are held in both fixed rate and adjustable rate security these asset are included in cash equivalent and short term or long term available for sale investment investment in fixed rate instrument carry degree of interest rate risk the fair value of fixed rate security may be adversely impacted due to rise in interest rate additionally falling rate environment creates reinvestment risk because security mature the proceeds are reinvested at lower rate generating le interest income historically we have been able to hold investment until maturity neither our operating result or cash flow have been nor are expected to be materially impacted by sudden change in market interest rate the fair value balance of our fixed rate investment security at september and were billion and billion respectively hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in interest rate would create an estimated change in fair value of approximately million on our fixed rate investment security at september the fair value balance of our adjustable rate debt security were billion and million at september and respectively visa europe put optionwe have liability related to the put option with visa europe which is recorded at fair value at september we are required to record any change in the fair value of the put option on quarterly basis in the determination of the fair value of the put option at september we have assumed probability of exercise by visa europe at some point in the future and differential at the time of exercise of approximately the use of probability of exercise higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in the value of the put option an increase of in the assumed differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in the value of the put option see liquidity and capital resource and critical accounting estimate above pension plan riskour defined benefit pension plan asset were billion and million and projected benefit obligation were million and million at september and respectively material adverse decline in the value of pension plan asset and or the discount rate for benefit obligation would result in decrease in the funded status of the pension plan an

period defined in the option agreement or the adjusted sustainable income the calculation of visa europe adjusted sustainable income under the term of the put option agreement includes potentially material adjustment for cost synergy and other negotiated item upon exercise the key input to this formula including visa europe adjusted sustainable income will be the result of negotiation between the company and visa europe the put option agreement provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two party are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price the fair value of the put option represents the value of visa europe option which under certain condition could obligate the company to purchase it member equity interest for an amount above fair value the fair value of the put option doe not represent the actual purchase price that the company may be required to pay if the option is exercised which could be several billion dollar or more while the put option is in fact

pursuant to authority granted to visa europe under it article of association the company estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on reasonably available information including but not

estimate the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to visa europe the company determined the fair value of the put option to be approximately million at september and in determining the fair value of the put option on these date the company assumed probability of exercise by visa europe at some point in the future and an estimated long term differential at the time of exercise of change in the fair value of the put option are recorded non cash non operating income in the company consolidated statement of operation during fiscal the company reduced the value of the put option by

option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of visa europe such the put option liability is included in accrued liability on the company consolidated balance sheet at september

company may exercise the call option in the event of certain triggering event these triggering event involve the performance of visa europe measured an unremediated decline in the number of merchant or atm in the visa europe region that accepts visa branded product the company belief the likelihood of these event occurring is remote the framework agreement the relationship between visa and visa
