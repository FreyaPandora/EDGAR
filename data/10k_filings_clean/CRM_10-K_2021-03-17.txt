the covid pandemic and related public health measure have materially affected how we and our customer are operating our business and have materially affected our operating result and cash flow the duration and extent to which this will impact our future result remain uncertain in response to the covid pandemic we have cancelled or delayed some customer event and shifted many of them including dreamforce world tour connection tableau conference basecamps and salesforce org higher ed summit to virtual only experience we may deem it advisable to similarly alter postpone or cancel entirely additional customer employee and industry event in the future our shift to creating virtual customer employee and industry event may not be successful and we may not be able to showcase our product well or generate the customer interest opportunity and lead through virtual event we have historically done through in person event if we attempt to reintroduce large in person event we may not be able to do so successfully and our customer may not be able or willing to attend them we also temporarily closed all salesforce office globally this global work from home operating environment ha caused strain for and ha adversely impacted productivity of certain employee and these condition may persist and harm our business including our future sale and operating result long the pandemic

portfolio and strategy and may present operational and workplace culture challenge that may adversely affect our business of contentsmoreover the condition caused by covid initially affected customer it spending and may in the future adversely affect our customer ability or willingness to purchase our enterprise cloud computing service these condition delayed and may in the future delay prospective customer purchasing decision and reduced and may in the future reduce the value or duration of our customer subscription contract and affect attrition rate all of which could adversely affect our future sale and operating result our operation have been negatively affected by range of external factor related to the covid pandemic that are not within our control authority throughout the world have implemented numerous preventative measure to contain or mitigate further spread of the virus such travel ban and restriction limitation on business activity quarantine work from home directive and shelter in place order these public health measure have caused and are continuing to cause business slowdown or shutdown in affected area both regionally and worldwide which have impacted our business and result of operation and cash flow for example these measure and related economic effect contributed to certain customer reluctance or inability to submit payment to well change in billing frequency and adversely impacted the effectiveness of outsourced service provider we use to collect payment and these condition may persist or worsen the extent and duration of these measure could also impact our ability to address cybersecurity incident have resulted in increased internet demand which could cause access issue could affect our ability to develop and support product and service and could cause issue with access to data center we continue to monitor the situation and public health guidance we may adjust our current policy and practice and existing and new precautionary measure could negatively affect our operation the extent of the impact of covid on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain development including the duration and spread of the pandemic future spike of covid infection resulting in additional preventative measure to contain or mitigate the spread of the virus severity of the economic decline attributable to the pandemic and timing and nature of potential economic recovery impact on our customer and our sale cycle our ability to generate new business lead impact on our customer employee and industry event and effect on our vendor all of which are uncertain and can not be predicted the long term impact of the covid pandemic on our financial condition or result of operation remains uncertain due to our subscription based business model the effect of the covid pandemic may not be fully reflected in our result of operation future period in addition uncertainty regarding the impact of covid on our future operating result and financial condition may result in our taking cost cutting measure reducing the level of our capital investment and delaying or canceling the implementation of strategic initiative any of which may negatively impact our business and reputation if the covid pandemic ha substantial impact on our employee partner or customer business and productivity our result of operation and overall financial performance may be harmed the global macroeconomic effect of the covid pandemic and related impact on our customer business operation and their demand for our product and service may persist for an indefinite period even the covid pandemic ha subsided in addition the effect of the covid pandemic may heighten many of the other risk described in this risk factor section if our security measure or those of our third party data center hosting facility cloud computing platform provider or third party service partner or the underlying infrastructure of the internet are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to customer data our data or our it system or authorized access is blocked or disabled our service may be perceived not being secure customer may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant reputational harm legal exposure and liability or negative financial impact our service involve the storage and transmission of our customer and our customer customer proprietary and other sensitive data including financial health and other personal information while we have security measure in place to protect our customer and our customer customer data our service and underlying infrastructure may in the future be materially breached or compromised result of the following third party attempt to fraudulently induce our employee partner or customer to disclose sensitive information such user name password or other information to gain access to our customer data or it system or our data or our it system effort by individual or group of hacker and sophisticated organization such state sponsored organization or nation state to launch coordinated attack including distributed denial of service attack third party attempt to abuse our marketing advertising or social platform to impersonate person or organization and disseminate information that is false or misleading cyberattacks on our internally built infrastructure on which many of our service offering operate or on third party cloud computing platform provider vulnerability resulting from enhancement and update to our existing service offering vulnerability in the product or component across the broad ecosystem that our service operate in conjunction with and are dependent on vulnerability existing within new technology and infrastructure including those from acquired company of content attack on or vulnerability in the many different underlying network and service that power the internet that our product depend on most of which are not under our control or the control of our vendor partner or customer and employee or contractor error or intentional act that compromise our security system in addition the change in our work environment result of the covid pandemic could adversely affect our security measure well our ability to address and respond to incident quickly these risk are mitigated to the extent possible by our ability to maintain and improve business and data governance policy enhanced process and internal security control including our ability to escalate and respond to known and potential risk our board of director audit committee and executive management are regularly briefed on our cybersecurity policy and practice and ongoing effort to improve security well periodic update on cybersecurity event although we have developed system and process designed to protect our customer and our customer customer proprietary and other sensitive data we can provide no assurance that such measure will provide absolute security or that material breach will not occur for example our ability to mitigate these risk may be impacted by the following frequent change to and growth in complexity of the technique used to breach obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage it system and infrastructure which are generally not recognized until launched against target and could result in our being unable to anticipate or implement adequate measure to prevent such technique the continued evolution of our internal it system we early adopt new technology and new way of sharing data and communicating internally and with partner and customer which increase the complexity of our it system the acquisition of new company requiring to incorporate and secure different or more complex it environment authorization by our customer to third party technology provider to access their customer data which may lead to our customer inability to protect their data that is stored on our server and our limited control over our customer or third party technology provider or the processing of data by third party technology provider which may not allow to maintain the integrity or security of such transmission or processing in the normal course of business we are and have been the target of malicious cyberattack attempt and have experienced other security incident to date such identified security event have not been material or significant to including to our reputation or business operation or had material financial impact but there can be no assurance that future cyberattacks will not be material or significant additionally our market presence grows we may face increased risk of cyberattack attempt or security threat security breach or incident could result in unauthorized party obtaining access to or the denial of authorized access to our it system or data or our customer system or data including intellectual property and proprietary sensitive or other confidential information security breach could also result in loss of confidence in the security of our service damage our reputation negatively impact our future sale disrupt our business and lead to increase in insurance premium and legal regulatory and financial exposure and liability finally the detection prevention and remediation of known or potential security vulnerability including those arising from third party hardware or software may result in additional financial burden due to additional direct and indirect cost such additional infrastructure capacity spending to mitigate any system degradation and the reallocation of resource from development activity defect or disruption in our service could diminish demand for our service and subject to substantial liability because our service are complex and incorporate variety of hardware proprietary software and third party software our service may have error or defect that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscriber and harm to our reputation and our business cloud service frequently contain undetected error when first introduced or when new version or enhancement are released we have from time to time found defect in and experienced disruption to our service and new defect or disruption may occur in the future such defect could be the result of employee contractor or other third party act or inaction and could negatively affect our brand and reputation additionally such defect could create vulnerability that could inadvertently permit access to protected customer data for example in fiscal we experienced significant service disruption due to an internally deployed software update that had an unintended impact on our service for certain customer we determined this disruption not materially affect our business reputation or financial result but there is no assurance such circumstance could not recur with material adverse effect on our business in addition our customer may use our service in unanticipated way that may cause disruption in service for other customer attempting to access their data we acquire company we may encounter difficulty in integrating the acquired technology into our service and in augmenting the technology to meet the quality standard that are consistent with our brand and reputation result our service may have error or defect resulting from the complexity of integrating acquisition since our customer use our service for important aspect of their business any error defect disruption in service or other performance problem could hurt our reputation and may damage our customer business result customer could elect to not renew our service or delay or withhold payment to we could also lose future sale or customer may make of contentswarranty or other claim against which could result in an increase in our allowance for doubtful account an increase in collection cycle for account receivable or the expense and risk of litigation any interruption or delay in service from third party including data center hosting facility cloud computing platform provider and other hardware and software vendor or from our inability to adequately plan for and manage service interruption or infrastructure capacity requirement could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business we currently serve our customer from third party data center hosting facility and cloud computing platform provider located in the united state and other country we also rely on computer hardware purchased or leased from software licensed from and cloud computing platform provided by third party in order to offer our service including database software hardware and data from variety of vendor any disruption or damage to or failure of our system generally including the system of our third party platform provider could result in interruption in our service we have from time to time experienced interruption in our service and such interruption may occur in the future in addition the ongoing covid pandemic ha disrupted and may continue to disrupt the supply chain of hardware needed to maintain these third party system or to run our business we increase our reliance on these third party system particularly with respect to third party cloud computing platform our exposure to damage from service interruption may increase interruption in our service may cause to issue credit or pay penalty cause customer to make warranty or other claim against or to terminate their subscription and adversely affect our attrition rate and our ability to attract new customer all of which would reduce our revenue our business and reputation would also be harmed if our customer and potential customer believe our service are unreliable for many of our offering our production environment and customer data are replicated in near real time in separate facility located elsewhere certain offering including some offering of company added through acquisition may be served through alternate facility or arrangement we do not control the operation of any of these facility and they may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquake flood fire power loss telecommunication failure and similar event they may also be subject to break in sabotage intentional act of vandalism and similar misconduct well local administrative action including shelter in place or similar order change to legal or permitting requirement and litigation to stop limit or delay operation despite precaution taken at these facility such disaster recovery and business continuity arrangement the occurrence of natural disaster or pandemic including the covid pandemic an act of terrorism decision to close the facility without adequate notice or other unanticipated problem at these facility could result in lengthy interruption in our service these hardware software data and cloud computing platform may not continue to be available at reasonable price on commercially reasonable term or at all any loss of the right to use any of these hardware software or cloud computing platform could significantly increase our expense and otherwise result in delay in the provisioning of our service until equivalent technology is either developed by or if available is identified obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our service if we do not accurately plan for our infrastructure capacity requirement and we experience significant strain on our data center capacity our customer could experience performance degradation or service outage that may subject to financial liability result in customer loss and harm our reputation and business we add data center and capacity and continue to move to cloud computing platform provider we may move or transfer our data and our customer data despite precaution taken during this process any unsuccessful data transfer may impair the delivery of our service which may damage our business we acquire and invest in company or technology we may not realize the expected business or financial benefit and the acquisition could prove difficult to integrate disrupt our business dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating result and the market value of our common stock part of our business strategy we periodically make investment in or acquisition of complementary business joint venture service and technology and intellectual property right we continue to evaluate such opportunity and expect to continue to make such investment and acquisition in the future such the pending acquisition of slack technology inc slack which wa signed in december and is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal acquisition and other transaction arrangement and investment involve numerous risk and could create unforeseen operating difficulty and expenditure including potential failure to achieve the expected benefit on timely basis or at all potential identified or unknown security vulnerability in acquired product that expose to additional security risk or delay our ability to integrate the product into our service offering or recognize the benefit of our investment difficulty in increasing or maintaining the security standard for acquired technology consistent with our other service and related cost of content difficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platform and customer acceptance of multiple platform on temporary or permanent basis augmenting the acquired technology and platform to the level that are consistent with our brand and reputation challenge converting the acquired company revenue recognition policy and forecasting the related revenue including subscription based revenue and software license revenue well appropriate allocation of the customer consideration to the individual deliverable diversion of financial and managerial resource from existing operation the potential entry into new market in which we have little or no experience or where competitor may have stronger market position currency and regulatory risk associated with foreign country and potential additional cybersecurity and compliance risk resulting from entry into new market difficulty in integrating acquired operation technology service platform and personnel the inability to obtain or material delay in obtaining the regulatory approval including from antitrust or other similar regulatory authority necessary to complete transaction or to integrate operation or potential remedy imposed by regulatory authority either condition to or following the completion of transaction such the global hold separate order issued in connection with our acquisition of tableau by the united kingdom competition market authority in fiscal which order wa lifted in fiscal which may include divestiture ownership or operational restriction or other structural or behavioral remedy failure to fully assimilate integrate or retrain acquired employee which may lead to retention risk with respect to both key acquired employee and our existing key employee or disruption to existing team difference our value and those of our acquired company inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment cost inability to maintain relationship with customer and partner of the acquired business challenge with the acquired company third party service provider including those that are required for ongoing access to third party data change to customer relationship or customer perception of the acquired business result of the acquisition potential for acquired product to impact the profitability of existing product unanticipated expense related to acquired technology and it integration into our existing technology known and potential unknown liability associated with the acquired business including due to litigation difficulty in managing or potential write offs of acquired asset or investment and potential financial and credit risk associated with acquired customer negative impact to our result of operation because of the depreciation and amortization of amount related to acquired intangible asset fixed asset and operating lease right of use asset the loss of acquired unearned revenue and unbilled unearned revenue challenge relating to the structure of an investment such governance accountability and decision making conflict that may arise in the context of joint venture or other majority ownership investment difficulty in and financial cost of addressing acquired compensation structure inconsistent with our compensation structure additional stock based compensation issued or assumed in connection with the acquisition including the impact on stockholder dilution and our result of operation delay in customer purchase due to uncertainty related to any acquisition ineffective or inadequate control procedure and policy at the acquired company in the case of foreign acquisition challenge caused by integrating operation over distance and across different language culture and political environment and the tax effect and cost of any such acquisition including the related integration into our tax structure and assessment of the impact on the realizability of our future tax asset or liability including potential one time income tax payment in connection with the integration of clicksoftware and other acquired israeli entity any of these risk could harm our business or negatively impact our result of operation in addition to facilitate acquisition or investment we may seek additional equity or debt financing which may not be available on term favorable to or at all which may affect our ability to complete subsequent acquisition or investment and which may affect the risk of owning our common stock for example if we finance acquisition by issuing equity or convertible or other debt security or of contentsloans our existing stockholder may be diluted or we could face constraint related to the term of and repayment obligation related to the incurrence of indebtedness that could affect the market price of our common stock our ability to acquire other business or technology make strategic investment or integrate acquired business effectively may be impaired by the effect of the covid pandemic government action in light of the pandemic trade tension and increased global scrutiny of foreign investment and acquisition and investment in the technology sector for example number of country including the and country in europe and the asia pacific region are considering or have adopted restriction of varying kind on transaction involving foreign investment whether in response to the covid pandemic or otherwise antitrust authority in number of country have also reviewed acquisition and investment in the technology industry with increased scrutiny government may continue to adopt or tighten restriction of this nature some of which may apply to acquisition investment or integration of business by and such restriction or government action could negatively impact our business and financial result we may not complete the acquisition of slack within the time frame we anticipate or at all the completion of the acquisition of slack is subject to number of condition including receipt of slack stockholder approval expiration or termination of the waiting period pursuant to the hart scott rodino antitrust improvement act of amended the hsr act and receipt of other approval consent or clearance under specified antitrust and foreign investment law pursuant to the hsr act on february we and slack each received request for additional information and documentary material often referred to second request from the antitrust division of the department of justice the doj issuance of the second request extends the waiting period under the hsr act until day after we and slack have each substantially complied with the second request unless the period for review is extended voluntarily by the party and the doj or is terminated earlier by the doj we and slack have and will continue to cooperate fully with the doj in it review we continue to anticipate completing the transaction during it fiscal quarter ending july subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the closing condition specified in the merger agreement the failure to satisfy all of the required condition could delay the completion of the acquisition for significant period of time or prevent it from occurring at all for example under certain limited condition we and slack may elect to terminate the merger agreement which could materially and adversely affect our business and reputation delay in completing the acquisition could cause to realize some or all of the benefit later than we otherwise expect to realize them if the acquisition is successfully completed within the anticipated time frame which could result in additional transaction cost or in other negative effect associated with uncertainty about the completion of the acquisition we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefit of the slack acquisition and the merger or those benefit may take longer to realize than expected we believe that there are significant benefit and synergy that may be realized through combining the product scale and combined enterprise customer base of salesforce and slack however the effort to realize these benefit and synergy will be complex process and may disrupt both company existing operation if not implemented in timely and efficient manner the full benefit of the acquisition including the anticipated sale or growth opportunity may not be realized expected or may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all failure to achieve the anticipated benefit of the acquisition could adversely affect our result of operation or cash flow cause dilution to our earnings per share decrease or delay any accretive effect of the acquisition and negatively impact the price of our common stock in addition we will be required post closing to devote significant attention and resource to successfully align our business practice and operation this process may disrupt the business and if ineffective would limit the anticipated benefit of the acquisition supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resource and infrastructure and if we are unable to scale our operation and increase productivity we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan we continue to experience significant growth in our customer base and personnel particularly through acquisition which ha placed strain on and in the future may stress the capability of our management administrative operational and financial infrastructure we anticipate that significant additional investment will be required to scale our operation and increase productivity to address the need of our customer to further develop and enhance our service to expand into new geographic area and to scale with our overall growth the additional investment we are making will increase our cost base which will make it more difficult for to offset any future revenue shortfall by reducing expense in the short term whether due to the effect of and financial burden associated with the covid pandemic or otherwise we may not be able to make these investment quickly or effectively necessary to successfully scale our operation we regularly upgrade or replace our various software system if the implementation of these new application are delayed or if we encounter unforeseen problem with our new system or in migrating away from our existing application and system our operation and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted of contentsour success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to manage our projected growth effectively to do so we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employee and to hire train and manage new employee needed additionally change in our work environment and workforce result of the covid pandemic could adversely affect our operation the covid pandemic may have long term effect on the nature of the office environment and remote working any adjustment made to our current and future office environment or work from home policy may not meet the need and expectation of our workforce which could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain our employee to manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operation and personnel we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management control our reporting system and procedure and our utilization of real estate if we fail to successfully scale our operation and increase productivity we may be unable to execute our business plan and the value of our common stock could decline if our customer do not renew their subscription for our service or if they reduce the number of paying subscription at the time of renewal our revenue and current remaining performance obligation could decline and our business may suffer if we can not accurately predict subscription renewal or upgrade rate we may not meet our revenue target which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock our customer have no obligation to renew their subscription for our service after the expiration of their contractual subscription period which is typically to month and in the normal course of business some customer have elected not to renew in addition our customer may renew for fewer subscription renew for shorter contract length or switch to lower cost offering of our service it is difficult to predict attrition rate given our varied customer base of enterprise and small and medium size business customer and the number of multi year subscription contract historically our subscription and support revenue primarily consisted of subscription fee however with the may acquisition of mulesoft and the august acquisition of tableau subscription and support revenue also include term software license sale we have le experience forecasting the renewal rate of such term software license sale our attrition rate may increase or fluctuate result of number of factor including customer dissatisfaction with our service customer spending level mix of customer base decrease in the number of user at our customer competition pricing increase or change and deteriorating general economic condition including result of the covid pandemic our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional feature and service more subscription or enhanced edition of our service to our current customer this may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sale effort that are targeted at senior management similarly the rate at which our customer purchase new or enhanced service depends on number of factor including general economic condition and that our customer do not react negatively to any price change related to these additional feature and service if customer do not renew their subscription do not purchase additional feature or enhanced subscription or if attrition rate increase our business could be harmed periodic change to our sale organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth we periodically change and make adjustment to our sale organization in response to market opportunity competitive threat management change product introduction or enhancement acquisition sale performance increase in sale headcount cost level and other internal and external consideration such sale organization change have in some period resulted in and may in the future result in reduction of productivity which could negatively impact our rate of growth and operating result in addition any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sale organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth our ability to deliver our service is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet by third party the internet infrastructure comprises of many different network and service that are highly fragmented and distributed by design this infrastructure is run by series of independent third party organization that work together to provide the infrastructure and supporting service of the internet under the governance of the internet corporation for assigned number and name icann and the internet assigned number authority now under the stewardship of icann the internet ha experienced variety of outage and other delay result of damage to portion of it infrastructure denial of service attack or related cyber incident and it could face outage and delay in the future potentially reducing the availability of the internet to or our customer for delivery of our internet based service any resulting interruption in our service or the ability of our customer to access our service could result in loss of potential or existing customer and harm our business in addition certain country have implemented or may implement legislative and technological action that either do or can effectively regulate access to the internet including the ability of internet service provider to limit access to specific website or content other country have attempted or are attempting to change or limit the legal protection available to business that depend on the internet for the delivery of their service additionally the covid pandemic ha also led to of contentsquarantines shelter in place order and work from home directive all of which have increased demand for internet access and may create access challenge these action could potentially limit or interrupt access to our service from certain country or internet service provider increase our risk or add liability impede our growth productivity and operational effectiveness result in the loss of potential or existing customer and harm our business sale to customer outside the united state expose to risk inherent in international operation we sell our service throughout the world and are subject to risk and challenge associated with international business we intend to continue to expand our international sale effort the risk and challenge associated with sale to customer outside the united state or those that can affect international operation generally include natural disaster act of war terrorism and actual or threatened public health emergency including the ongoing covid pandemic and related public health measure and resulting change to law and regulation including change oriented toward protecting local business or restricting the movement of our or our customer employee localization of our service including translation into foreign language and associated expense regulatory framework or business practice favoring local competitor pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nation where we have customer and balance of our cash cash equivalent and marketable security foreign currency fluctuation and control which may make our service more expensive for international customer and could add volatility to our operating result compliance with multiple conflicting ambiguous or evolving governmental law and regulation including employment tax privacy anti corruption import export custom anti boycott sanction and embargo antitrust data transfer storage and protection and industry specific law and regulation including rule related to compliance by our third party resellers and our ability to identify and respond timely to compliance issue when they occur liquidity issue or political action by sovereign nation including nation with controlled currency environment which could result in decreased value of these balance or potential difficulty protecting our foreign asset or satisfying local obligation vetting and monitoring our third party resellers in new and evolving market to confirm they maintain standard consistent with our brand and reputation treatment of revenue from international source evolving domestic and international tax environment and change to tax code including being subject to foreign tax law and being liable for paying withholding tax in foreign jurisdiction uncertainty regarding regulation currency tax and operation resulting from the united kingdom exit from the eu brexit on january and possible disruption in trade the sale of our service and commerce and movement of our people between the united kingdom eu and other location uncertainty regarding the imposition of and change in the united state and other government trade regulation trade war tariff other restriction or other geopolitical event including the evolving relation between the united state and china change in the public perception of government in the region where we operate or plan to operate regional data privacy law and other regulatory requirement that apply to outsourced service provider and to the transmission of our customer data across international border which grow more complex we scale expand into new market and enhance the breadth of our service offering different pricing environment difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operation different or lesser protection of our intellectual property including increased risk of theft of our proprietary technology and other intellectual property longer account receivable payment cycle and other collection difficulty and regional economic and political condition any of these factor could negatively impact our business and result of operation the above factor may also negatively impact our ability to successfully expand into emerging market country where we have little or no operating experience where it can be costly and challenging to establish and maintain operation including hiring and managing required personnel and difficult to promote our brand and where we may not benefit from any first to market advantage or otherwise succeed more of our sale effort are targeted at larger enterprise customer our sale cycle may become more time consuming and expensive we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and configuration challenge and we of contentsmay have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transaction all of which could harm our business and operating result we target more of our sale effort at larger enterprise customer including governmental entity we may face greater cost longer sale cycle greater competition and le predictability in completing some of our sale in this market segment the customer decision to use our service may be an enterprise wide decision and if so these type of sale would require to provide greater level of education regarding the use and benefit of our service well addressing concern regarding privacy and data protection law and regulation of prospective customer with international operation or whose own customer operate internationally moreover restriction in place in response to the covid pandemic have disrupted our operation and our customer operation and business and this ha adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our sale effort in addition larger customer and governmental entity may demand more configuration integration service and feature result of these factor these sale opportunity may require to devote greater sale support and professional service resource to individual customer driving up cost and time required to complete sale and diverting our own sale and professional service resource to smaller number of larger transaction while potentially requiring to delay revenue recognition on some of these transaction until the technical or implementation requirement have been met pricing and packaging strategy for enterprise and other customer for subscription to our existing and future service offering may not be widely accepted by other new or existing customer our adoption of such new pricing and packaging strategy may harm our business for large enterprise customer professional service may also be performed by third party or combination of our own staff and third party our strategy is to work with third party to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these service to our customer if customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by or third party or with the type of service or solution delivered we could incur additional cost to address the situation the profitability of that work might be impaired and the customer dissatisfaction with our service could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer in addition negative publicity related to our customer relationship regardless of it accuracy may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current or prospective customer we may lose key member of our management team or development and operation personnel and may be unable to attract and retain employee we need to support our operation and growth our success depends substantially upon the continued service of our executive officer and other key member of management particularly our chief executive officer from time to time there may be change in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executive for example in february keith block resigned co ceo and director of the company and in february mark hawkins resigned president and chief financial officer of the company such change in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business we are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operation personnel because of the complexity of our service and technology our executive officer key management development or operation personnel could terminate their employment with at any time the loss of one or more of our key employee or group of employee could seriously harm our business the technology industry is subject to substantial and continuous competition for engineer with high level of experience in designing developing and managing software and internet related service well competition for sale executive data scientist and operation personnel we are also committed to building diverse workforce we have experienced significant competition in talent recruitment and retention and may not in the future be successful in our talent recruitment and retention or achieving the diversity goal we have set publicly we have from time to time experienced and we expect to continue to experience difficulty in hiring developing integrating and retaining highly skilled employee with appropriate qualification these difficulty may be amplified by evolving restriction on immigration travel or availability of visa for skilled technology worker including restriction imposed in response to the covid pandemic these difficulty may potentially be further amplified by the high cost of living in the san francisco bay area where our headquarters are located if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel our business and future growth prospect could be severely harmed in addition we believe in the importance of our corporate culture which foster dialogue collaboration recognition equality and sense of family our organization grows and expands globally and employee workplace expectation develop we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspect of our corporate culture these difficulty may be further amplified by work from home requirement imposed and other workforce action taken in response to the covid pandemic our inability to maintain our corporate culture could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employee or our reputation with customer and could negatively impact our future growth of contentsany failure in our delivery of high quality technical support service may adversely affect our relationship with our customer and our financial result our customer depend on our support organization to resolve technical issue relating to our application we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short term increase in customer demand for support service across our varying and diverse offering outsourced provision of technical support may be suddenly and adversely impacted by unforeseen event for example occurred when certain business process outsourced service provider were delayed in effectively servicing our customer due to condition related to the covid pandemic increased customer demand for these service without corresponding revenue could increase cost and adversely affect our operating result in addition our sale process is highly dependent on our application and business reputation and on positive recommendation from our existing customer any failure to maintain high quality technical support or market perception that we do not maintain high quality support could adversely affect our reputation our ability to sell our service offering to existing and prospective customer and our business operating result and financial position strategic and industry risksour effort to expand our service offering and to develop and integrate our existing service in order to keep pace with technological development may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and harm our business we derive significant portion of our revenue from subscription to our crm enterprise cloud computing application service and we expect this will continue for the foreseeable future our effort to expand our current service offering may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate in addition the market for certain of our offering including work com customer truth and other offering remain relatively new and it is uncertain whether our effort and related investment will ever result in significant revenue for in addition we may be required to continuously enhance our artificial intelligence offering so that quality recommendation can be provided to our customer further the introduction of significant platform change and upgrade such our introduction of hyperforce in fiscal may not succeed and early stage interest and adoption of such new service may not result in long term success or significant revenue for additionally if we fail to anticipate or identify significant internet related and other technology trend and development early enough or if we do not devote appropriate resource to adapting to such trend and development our business could be harmed if we are unable to develop enhancement to and new feature for our existing or new service that keep pace with rapid technological development our business could be harmed the success of enhancement new feature and service depends on several factor including the timely completion introduction and market acceptance of the feature service or enhancement by customer administrator and developer well our ability to seamlessly integrate all of our product and service offering and develop adequate selling capability in new market failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth well negatively impact our operating result if the additional cost are not offset by additional revenue in addition because our service are designed to operate over various network technology and on variety of mobile device operating system and computer hardware and software platform using standard browser we will need to continuously modify and enhance our service to keep pace with change in internet related hardware software communication browser app development platform and database technology well continue to maintain and support our service on legacy system we may not be successful in either developing these modification and enhancement or in bringing them to market timely additionally change to our work environment and workforce result of the covid pandemic could adversely affect our ability to timely develop enhancement to and new feature for existing or new service our effort to quickly introduce new offering designed to help our customer respond to the covid pandemic including our work com offering may not be successful furthermore uncertainty about the timing and nature of new network platform or technology including hyperforce or modification to existing platform or technology including text messaging capability or change in customer usage pattern thereof could increase our research and development or service delivery expense or lead to our increased reliance on certain vendor any failure of our service to operate effectively with future network platform and technology could reduce the demand for our service result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand we believe that the brand identity we have developed including association with trust customer success innovation and equality have significantly contributed to the success of our business maintaining and enhancing the salesforce brand and our other brand are critical to expanding our base of customer partner and employee our brand strength particularly for our core service will depend largely on our ability to remain technology leader and continue to provide high quality innovative product service and feature securely reliably and in manner that enhances our customer success even we scale and expand our service in order to maintain and enhance the strength of our brand we may make substantial investment to expand or improve our product offering and service or enter new market that may be accompanied by initial complication or ultimately prove to be unsuccessful of contentsin addition we have secured the naming right to facility controlled by third party such office tower and transit center and any negative event or publicity arising in connection with these facility could adversely impact our brand further entry into market with weaker protection of brand or change in the legal system in country we operate may impact our ability to protect our brand if we fail to maintain enhance or protect our brand or if we incur excessive expense in our effort to do so our business operating result and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected we are subject to risk associated with our strategic investment including partial or complete loss of invested capital significant change in the fair value of this portfolio including change in the valuation of our investment in publicly traded and privately held company could negatively impact our financial result we have strategic investment in publicly traded and privately held company in both domestic and international market including in emerging market these company range from early stage company to more mature company with established revenue stream and business model many such company generate net loss and the market for their product service or technology may be slow to develop and therefore they are dependent on the availability of later round of financing from bank or investor on favorable term to continue their operation the financial success of our investment in any privately held company is typically dependent on liquidity event such public offering acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment likewise the financial success of our investment in any publicly held company is typically dependent upon an exit in favorable market condition and to lesser extent on liquidity event the capital market for public offering and acquisition are dynamic and the likelihood of successful liquidity event for the company we have invested in could significantly worsen further valuation of privately held company are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data the rapid spread of covid and it reverberating effect on the global economy have caused disruption to our industry to the industry in which our portfolio company operate and to financial market these disruption are inhibiting and may continue to inhibit the ability of our portfolio company to meet their performance target raise fundraising round or complete liquidity event in some case our portfolio company may no longer be able to operate or could experience reduced revenue or profitability increased customer attrition delayed cancelled or unsuccessful public offering reduced ability to raise additional round of financing reduced acquisition offer or acquisition offer on unfavorable term reduced valuation in both private and public market or insolvency and bankruptcy these outcome could materially adversely affect our financial position result of operation and cash flow the enterprise cloud computing ecosystem ha matured the opportunity in which we can invest have expanded to include investment in company concurrently with an initial public offering in addition to our investment in early to late stage private company therefore our investment strategy and portfolio have also expanded to include more mature company in certain case our ability to sell these investment may be constrained by contractual obligation to hold the security for period of time after public offering including market standoff agreement and lock up agreement we record all fair value adjustment of our publicly traded and privately held equity investment through the consolidated statement of operation result we may experience additional volatility to our statement of operation due to change in market price of our investment in publicly held equity investment and the valuation and timing of observable price change or impairment of our investment in privately held security our ability to mitigate this volatility in any given period may be impacted by our contractual obligation to hold security for set period of time for example some of our investment in publicly traded security may be subject to lock up agreement which would prevent our ability to sell these investment after public offering or otherwise impede our ability to mitigate market volatility in such security volatility in the financial market including the impact of the covid pandemic ha been and could continue to be material to our result in any given quarter and may cause our stock price to decline while historically our investment portfolio ha had positive impact on our financial result that may not be true for future period particularly in period of significant market fluctuation which affect our strategic investment portfolio all of our investment especially our investment in privately held company are subject to risk of partial or total loss of investment capital in addition in the future we may deploy material investment in individual investee company resulting in the increasing concentration of risk in small number of company change in the fair value or partial or total loss of investment capital of these individual company could be material to our financial statement if third party developer and provider do not continue to embrace our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing service or if our customer seek warranty from for third party application integration data and content our business could be harmed our success depends on the willingness of growing community of third party developer and technology provider to build application and provide integration data and content that are complementary to our service without the continued development of these application and provision of such integration data and content both current and potential customer may not find our service sufficiently attractive which could impact future sale in addition for those customer who authorize third party technology partner access to their data we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality security or of contentsintegrity of the data access transmission or processing despite contract provision to protect customer may look to to support and provide warranty for the third party application integration data and content even though not developed or sold by which may expose to potential claim liability and obligation all of which could harm our reputation and our business the market in which we participate is intensely competitive and if we do not compete effectively our operating result could be harmed the market for enterprise application and platform service is highly competitive rapidly evolving and fragmented and subject to changing technology low barrier to entry shifting customer need and frequent introduction of new product and service many prospective customer have invested substantial personnel and financial resource to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their business and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to an enterprise cloud computing application service additionally third party developer may be reluctant to build application service on our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platform our current competitor include internally developed enterprise application by our potential customer it department vendor of packaged business software well company offering enterprise apps delivered through on premise offering from enterprise software application vendor and cloud computing application service provider either individually or with others software company that provide their product or service free of charge single product or when bundled with other offering or only charge premium for advanced feature and functionality vendor who offer software tailored to specific service that are more directed toward those specific service than our full suite of service offering supplier of traditional business intelligence and data preparation product well business analytics software company integration software vendor and other company offering integration or api solution marketing vendor which may specialize in advertising targeting messaging or campaign automation commerce solution from established and emerging cloud only vendor and established on premise vendor and traditional platform development environment company and cloud computing development platform company who may develop toolsets and product that allow customer to build new apps that run on the customer current infrastructure or hosted service in addition we may face more competition we expand our product offering some of our current and potential competitor may have competitive advantage such greater name recognition longer operating history more significant installed base broader geographic scope broader suite of service offering and larger marketing budget well substantially greater financial technical personnel and other resource in addition many of our current and potential competitor have established marketing relationship and access to larger customer base and have major distribution agreement with consultant system integrator and resellers we also experience competition from smaller younger competitor that may be more agile in responding to customer demand these competitor may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunity technology standard or customer requirement or provide competitive pricing result even if our service are more effective than the product and service that our competitor offer potential customer might select competitive product and service in lieu of purchasing our service for all of these reason we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitor which could negatively impact our future sale and harm our business social and ethical issue including the use of ai in our offering may result in reputational harm and liability position we take on social and ethical issue may be unpopular with some of our employee or with our customer or potential customer which ha in the past impacted and may in the future impact our ability to attract or retain customer we also may choose not to conduct business with potential customer or discontinue or not expand business with existing customer due to these position further action taken by our customer including through the use or misuse of our product may result in reputational harm or possible liability for example we have been subject to allegation in legal proceeding that we should be liable for the use of certain of our product by third party although we believe that such claim lack merit such claim could cause reputational harm to our brand or result in liability we are increasingly building ai into many of our offering with many innovation ai and our customer platform present additional risk and challenge that could affect their adoption and therefore our business for example the development of ai and customer the latter of which provides information regarding our customer customer present emerging ethical issue and if we enable or offer solution that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on of contentshuman right privacy employment or in other social context we may experience brand or reputational harm competitive harm or legal liability data practice by or others that result in controversy could impair the acceptance of artificial intelligence solution this in turn could undermine the decision prediction or analysis ai application produce subjecting to competitive harm legal liability and brand or reputational harm our brand is also associated with our public commitment to sustainability equality and ethical use and any perceived change in our dedication to these commitment could harm our reputation or brand and could adversely impact our relationship with our customer our disclosure on these matter and standard we set for or failure to meet these standard may influence our reputation and the value of our brand for example we have elected to share publicly certain information about our corporate environmental social and governance esg initiative and our commitment to the recruitment of diverse workforce our business may face increased scrutiny related to these activity including from the investment community and our failure to achieve progress in these area on timely basis or at all could adversely affect our reputation business financial performance and growth legal and regulatory risksprivacy concern and law such the forthcoming california privacy right act the california consumer privacy act and the european union general data protection regulation evolving regulation of cloud computing cross border data transfer restriction and other domestic or foreign regulation may limit the use and adoption of our service and adversely affect our business regulation related to the provision of service over the internet is evolving federal state and foreign government continue to adopt new or modify existing law and regulation addressing data privacy cybersecurity data protection data sovereignty and the collection processing storage transfer and use of data generally in some case data privacy law and regulation such the european union eu general data protection regulation gdpr that took effect in may impose obligation directly on salesforce both data controller and data processor well on many of our customer in addition new domestic data privacy law such the california consumer privacy act ccpa which took effect in january and the california privacy right act which will amend the ccpa in january similarly impose new obligation on and many of our customer potentially both business and service provider these law continue to evolve and various state introduce similar proposal we and our customer could be exposed to additional regulatory burden further law and legislative proposal such the eu proposed privacy regulation are increasingly aimed at the use of personal information for marketing purpose and the tracking of individual online activity although we monitor the regulatory environment and have invested in addressing these development these law may require to make additional change to our practice and service to enable or our customer to meet the new legal requirement and may also increase our potential liability exposure through new or higher potential penalty for noncompliance including result of penalty fine and lawsuit related to data breach these new or proposed law and regulation are subject to differing interpretation and may be inconsistent among jurisdiction these and other requirement could reduce demand for our service require to take on more onerous obligation in our contract restrict our ability to store transfer and process data or in some case impact our ability or our customer ability to offer our service in certain location to deploy our solution to reach current and prospective customer or to derive insight from customer data globally for example on july the court of justice of the european union cjeu invalidated the eu privacy shield framework one of the mechanism that allowed company including salesforce to transfer personal data from the european economic area eea to the united state in addition the cjeu commented that company relying on another such mechanism the european commission standard contractual clause should ass on case by case basis whether the law of the country of destination ensures adequate protection of personal data transferred under eu law by providing where necessary additional safeguard to those offered by those clause salesforce relies upon binding corporate rule third mechanism which provides additional safeguard with respect to government request for eu personal data well the european commission standard contractual clause to transfer eu personal data internationally depending on how the cjeu decision is enforced the cost and complexity of providing our service in certain market may increase based on draft recommendation issued by the european data protection board edpb body of privacy regulator from across the eu charged with ensuring consistent application of gdpr current indication are that absent agreement on new bilateral cross border transfer mechanism to replace the eu privacy shield framework regulator may be inclined to interpret the decision significantly restricting certain cross border transfer certain country outside of the eea russia china and india have also passed or are considering passing law requiring varying degree of local data residency by way of further example statutory damage available through private right of action for certain data breach under ccpa and potentially other state law may increase our and our customer potential liability and the demand our customer place on the cost of compliance with and other burden imposed by privacy law regulation and standard may limit the use and adoption of our service reduce overall demand for our service make it more difficult to meet expectation from or commitment to customer and our customer customer lead to significant fine penalty or liability for noncompliance impact our reputation or slow the pace at which we close sale transaction in particular where customer request specific warranty and unlimited indemnity for noncompliance with privacy law any of which could harm our business of contentsin addition to government activity privacy advocate and other industry group have established or may establish new self regulatory standard that may place additional burden on our ability to provide our service globally our customer expect to meet voluntary certification and other standard established by third party such truste if we are unable to maintain these certification or meet these standard it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solution to certain customer and could harm our business in addition we have seen trend toward the private enforcement of data protection obligation including through private action for alleged noncompliance which could harm our business and negatively impact our reputation for example in we were made party to legal proceeding brought by dutch privacy advocacy group on behalf of certain dutch citizen that claim we violated the gdpr and dutch telecommunication act through the processing and sharing of data in connection with our audience studio and data studio product we were also named defendant in similar lawsuit brought in the uk although we believe that these claim lack merit these or similar future claim could cause reputational harm to our brand or result in liability furthermore the uncertain and shifting regulatory environment and trust climate particularly in regard to covid related data processing may raise concern regarding data privacy and cybersecurity which may cause our customer or our customer customer to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customer to use our service effectively in addition new product we develop in connection with changing event such in response to the covid pandemic may expose to liability or regulatory risk even the perception that the privacy and security of personal information are not satisfactorily protected or do not meet regulatory requirement could inhibit sale of our product or service and could limit adoption of our cloud based solution industry specific regulation and other requirement and standard are evolving and unfavorable industry specific law regulation interpretive position or standard could harm our business our customer and potential customer conduct business in variety of industry including financial service the public sector healthcare and telecommunication regulator in certain industry have adopted and may in the future adopt regulation or interpretive position regarding the use of cloud computing and other outsourced service the cost of compliance with and other burden imposed by industry specific law regulation and interpretive position may limit our customer use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for our service compliance with these regulation may also require to devote greater resource to support certain customer which may increase cost and lengthen sale cycle for example some financial service regulator have imposed guideline for use of cloud computing service that mandate specific control or require financial service enterprise to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain function if we are unable to comply with these guideline or control or if our customer are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our service where required our business may be harmed in addition an inability to satisfy the standard of certain voluntary third party certification body that our customer may expect such an attestation of compliance with the payment card industry pci data security standard may have an adverse impact on our business and result if in the future we are unable to achieve or maintain industry specific certification or other requirement or standard relevant to our customer it may harm our business and adversely affect our result further in some case industry specific regionally specific or product specific law regulation or interpretive position may impact our ability well the ability of our customer partner and data provider to collect augment analyze use transfer and share personal and other information that is integral to certain service we provide the interpretation of many of these statute regulation and ruling is evolving in the court and administrative agency and an inability to comply may have an adverse impact on our business and result this impact may be particularly acute in country that have passed or are considering passing legislation that requires data to remain localized in country this may impose financial cost on company required to store data in jurisdiction not of their choosing and to use nonstandard operational process that add complexity and are difficult and costly to integrate with global process any failure or perceived failure by to comply with such requirement could have an adverse impact on our business for example there are various statute regulation and ruling relevant to the direct email marketing and text messaging industry including the telephone consumer protection act tcpa and related federal communication commission order which impose significant restriction on the ability to utilize telephone call and text message to mobile telephone number mean of communication when the prior consent of the person being contacted ha not been obtained we have been and may in the future be subject to one or more class action lawsuit well individual lawsuit containing allegation that one of our business or customer violated the tcpa determination that we or our customer violated the tcpa or other communication based statute could expose to significant damage award that could individually or in the aggregate materially harm our business we have been and may in the future be sued by third party for various claim including alleged infringement of proprietary right we are involved in various legal matter arising from the normal course of business activity these include claim suit government investigation and other proceeding involving alleged infringement of third party patent and other intellectual property right well commercial corporate and security labor and employment class action wage and hour antitrust data privacy and other matter of contentsthe software and internet industry are characterized by the existence of large number of patent trademark trade secret and copyright and by frequent litigation based on allegation of infringement or other violation of intellectual property right we have received in the past and may receive in the future communication from third party including practicing entity and non practicing entity claiming that we have infringed their intellectual property right we have also been and may in the future be sued by third party for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary right our technology may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the right of third party or we may be required to pay damage or both further many of our subscription agreement require to indemnify our customer for third party intellectual property infringement claim which would increase the cost to of an adverse ruling on such claim in addition we have in the past been and may in the future be sued by third party who seek to target for action taken by our customer including through the use or misuse of our product for example we have been subject to allegation in legal proceeding that we should be liable for the use of certain of our product by third party although we believe that such claim lack merit such claim could cause reputational harm to our brand or result in liability our exposure to risk associated with various claim including claim related to the use of intellectual property well security and related stockholder derivative claim may be increased result of acquisition of other company for example we are subject to ongoing security class action litigation and related stockholder derivative claim brought against tableau that remain outstanding and to which we may ultimately be subject to liability or settlement cost additionally we may have lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risk with respect to acquired company or technology in addition third party have made claim in connection with our acquisition and may do so in the future and they may also make infringement and similar or related claim after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition the outcome of any claim or litigation regardless of the merit is inherently uncertain any claim or lawsuit and the disposition of such claim and lawsuit whether through settlement or licensing discussion or litigation could be time consuming and expensive to resolve divert management attention from executing our business plan result in effort to enjoin our activity lead to attempt on the part of other party to pursue similar claim and in the case of intellectual property claim require to change our technology change our business practice pay monetary damage or enter into short or long term royalty or licensing agreement any adverse determination or settlement related to intellectual property claim or other litigation could prevent from offering our service to others could be material to our financial condition or cash flow or both or could otherwise adversely affect our operating result including our operating cash flow in particular period in addition depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute an unfavorable resolution of legal matter could materially affect our current or future result of operation or cash flow in particular period any failure to protect our intellectual property right could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand cause to incur significant expense and harm our business if we fail to protect our intellectual property right adequately our competitor may gain access to our technology affecting our brand causing to incur significant expense and harming our business any of our patent trademark or other intellectual property right may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation while we have many patent and pending and international patent application we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent application or the patent protection may not be obtained quickly enough to meet our business need in addition our existing patent and any patent issued in the future may not provide with competitive advantage or may be successfully challenged by third party similar uncertainty applies to our and international trademark registration and application furthermore legal standard relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property right are uncertain and we also may face proposal to change the scope of protection for some intellectual property right in the and elsewhere effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to in every country in which our service are available and legal change and uncertainty in various country intellectual property regime may result in making conduct that we believe is lawful to be deemed violative of others right the law of some foreign country may not be protective of intellectual property right those in the and mechanism for enforcement of intellectual property right may be inadequate also our involvement in standard setting activity our contribution to open source project various competition law regime or the need to obtain license from others may require to license our intellectual property in certain circumstance accordingly despite our effort we may be unable to prevent third party from using our intellectual property we may be required to spend significant resource and expense to monitor and protect our intellectual property right we may initiate claim or litigation against third party for infringement of our proprietary right or to establish the validity of our proprietary right if we fail to protect our intellectual property right it could impact our ability to protect our technology and brand furthermore any litigation whether or not it is resolved in our favor could result in significant expense to cause to divert time and resource from our core business and harm our business of contentslawsuits were filed against slack salesforce and the member of the slack board in connection with the merger and additional lawsuit may be filed in the future an adverse ruling in any such lawsuit could result in an injunction preventing the completion of the merger and or substantial cost to salesforce security class action lawsuit and derivative lawsuit are often brought against public company that have entered into acquisition merger or other business combination agreement like the merger agreement even if such lawsuit is without merit defending against these claim can result in substantial cost and divert management time and resource an adverse judgment could result in monetary damage which could have negative impact on our liquidity and financial condition

that injunction may delay or prevent the merger from being completed within the expected time frame or at all which may adversely affect our business financial position and result of operation there can be no assurance that any of the defendant will be successful in the outcome of any lawsuit filed in connection with the merger the defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains

may provide for termination by the government at any time without cause and termination of any such contract may adversely impact our other existing or prospective government contract any of these risk related to contracting with governmental entity could adversely impact our future sale and operating result we are subject to governmental export and import control that could impair our ability to compete in international market and may subject to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable law our solution are subject to export and import control where we conduct our business activity including the commerce department export administration regulation custom regulation and various economic and trade sanction regulation established by the treasury department office of

provided by our resellers despite such precaution any such sale could have negative consequence including government investigation penalty and reputational harm change in our solution or change in trade regulation may create delay in the introduction sale and deployment of our solution in international market or prevent the export or import of our solution to certain country government or person altogether any decreased use of our solution or limitation on our ability to export or sell our solution may adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation import and export control regulation in the and other country are subject to change and uncertainty including result of geopolitical development relation between the united state and china and the effect of the covid pandemic of contentsfinancial risksbecause we generally recognize revenue from subscription for our service over the term of the subscription downturn or upturn in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating result we generally recognize revenue from customer ratably over the term of their subscription and support agreement which are typically to month result most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription and support agreement entered into during previous quarter consequently decline in new or renewed subscription in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue result for that quarter any such decline however will negatively impact our revenue in future quarter accordingly the effect of significant downturn in sale and market acceptance of our service and change in our attrition rate may not be fully reflected in our result of operation until future period including change resulting from the effect of the covid pandemic our subscription model also make it difficult for to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sale in any period revenue from new customer must be recognized over the applicable subscription and support term if we experience significant fluctuation in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expense with our revenue forecast our business could be harmed and the market price of our common stock could decline due to the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market condition including due to the impact of the covid pandemic the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing service the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation the growing complexity of our business including the use of multiple pricing and packaging model and the increasing amount of revenue from software license sale and our increasing focus on enterprise cloud computing service we may not be able to realize our projected revenue growth plan we plan our expense level and investment on estimate of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth we may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if the addition of new subscription or the renewal of existing subscription fall short of our expectation and unanticipated event such the covid pandemic may cause to incur expense beyond we anticipated portion of our expense may also be fixed in nature for some minimum amount of time such with cost capitalized to obtain revenue contract data center and infrastructure service contract or office lease so it may not be possible to reduce cost in timely manner or at all without the payment of fee to exit certain obligation early result we expect that our revenue operating result and cash flow may fluctuate significantly on quarterly basis and revenue growth rate may not be sustainable and may decline in the future and in some period we have not been able to and may not be able in the future to provide continued operating margin expansion which could harm our business and cause the market price of our common stock to decline unanticipated change in our effective tax rate and additional tax liability and global tax development may impact our financial result we are subject to income tax in the united state and various jurisdiction outside of the united state significant judgment is often required

development fluctuating commodity price and trade tariff development have caused and may in the future cause global economic uncertainty and uncertainty about the interest rate environment which could amplify the volatility of currency fluctuation although we attempt to mitigate some of this volatility and related risk through foreign currency hedging our hedging activity are limited in scope and may not effectively offset the adverse financial impact that may result from unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rate which could adversely impact our financial condition or result of operation our debt service obligation lease commitment and other contractual obligation may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow from operation of january we had substantial level of debt including our and senior note senior note and the loan we assumed when we purchased fremont due june in december we entered into credit agreement the revolving loan credit agreement which provides for billion unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility that matures in december replacing our previous revolving credit facility of billion there were no outstanding borrowing under the credit facility of january we may use the proceeds of future borrowing under the credit facility for general corporate purpose which may include without limitation financing the

bridge facility the original commitment in respect of the bridge facility were billion but were reduced to billion in december following our entry into billion three year senior unsecured loan agreement acquisition term loan in february we elected to further reduce our bridge facility commitment to billion the availability and funding of the bridge facility and the acquisition term loan are conditioned on the consummation of the acquisition of slack in accordance with the term of the merger agreement and are subject to certain exception qualification and other condition we expect to replace the commitment in respect of the bridge facility prior to the consummation of the acquisition with the incurrence of new indebtedness or commitment in respect thereof in addition to the outstanding and contemplated debt obligation above we have also recorded substantial liability associated with noncancellable future payment on our long term lease agreement we also have significant

and any additional issuance of indebtedness could impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital capital expenditure acquisition general corporate or other purpose cause to dedicate substantial portion of our cash flow from operation toward debt service obligation and principal repayment and make more vulnerable to downturn in our business our industry or the economy in general such recent downturn in connection with the effect of the covid pandemic our ability to meet our expense and debt obligation will depend on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic regulatory and other factor we will not be able to control many of these factor such economic condition and governmental regulation further our operation may not generate sufficient cash to enable to of contentsservice our debt or contractual obligation resulting from our lease if we fail to make payment on our debt we could be in default on such debt if

compliance with specified covenant our ability to comply with these covenant may be affected by event beyond our control failure to comply with the covenant and other provision of our outstanding debt could result in event of default under such instrument which could permit acceleration of all of our debt and borrowing any required repayment of our debt result of fundamental change or other acceleration would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those fund available for use in our business lease accounting guidance requires that we record liability for operating lease activity on our consolidated balance sheet which increase both our asset and liability and therefore may impact our ability to obtain the necessary financing from financial institution at commercially viable rate or at all our lease term may include option to extend or terminate the lease these option are reflected in the operating lease right of use rou asset which represents our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liability only when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option we reassess the lease term if and when significant event or

in the other three quarter of our fiscal year result our fiscal first quarter ha typically in the past been our largest collection and operating cash flow quarter this trend ha been adversely impacted by the effect of the covid pandemic and related economic downturn and uncertainty additionally some of the important factor that may cause our revenue operating result and cash flow to fluctuate from

our industry business and result of operation our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical condition the united state and other key international economy have experienced significant economic and market downturn in connection with the covid pandemic and are likely to experience additional cyclical downturn from time to time in which economic activity is impacted by falling demand for variety of good and service restricted credit poor liquidity reduced corporate profitability volatility in credit equity and foreign exchange market bankruptcy and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy these economic condition can arise suddenly did the condition associated with the covid pandemic and the full impact of such condition can be difficult to predict in addition geopolitical and domestic political development such existing and potential trade war and other event beyond our control can increase level of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial market ha been the case with the covid pandemic and relation between the united state and china moreover these condition have affected and may continue to affect the rate of it spending could adversely affect our customer ability or willingness to attend our event or to purchase our enterprise cloud computing service have

including our corporate headquarters and are experiencing and expect to continue to experience ongoing effect related to the local and global economic and other effect of this of contentspandemic although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plan such event could make it difficult or impossible for to deliver our service to our customer and could decrease demand for our service our corporate headquarters and significant portion of our personnel research and development activity it system and other critical business operation are located near major seismic fault in the san francisco bay area because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct earthquake related loss with the exception of the building that we own in san francisco and significant recovery time could be required to resume operation our financial condition and operating result could be materially adversely affected in the event of major earthquake or catastrophic event and the adverse effect of any such catastrophic event would be exacerbated if experienced at the same time another unexpected and adverse event such the covid pandemic for example wildfire have resulted in power shut offs in the san francisco bay area and are likely to occur in the future and this could adversely affect the work from home operation of our employee in the san francisco bay area climate change may have an impact on our business while we seek to mitigate our business risk associated with climate change by establishing robust environmental program and partnering with organization who are also focused on mitigating their own climate related risk we recognize that there are inherent climate related risk wherever business is conducted any of our primary location may be vulnerable to the adverse effect of climate change for example our california headquarters have historically experienced and are projected to continue to experience climate related event at an increasing frequency including drought water scarcity heat wave wildfire and resultant air quality impact and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention furthermore it is more difficult to mitigate the impact of these event on our employee while they work from home result of the covid pandemic changing market dynamic global policy development and the increasing frequency and impact of extreme weather event on critical infrastructure in the and elsewhere have the potential to disrupt our business the business of our third party supplier and the business of our customer and may cause to experience higher attrition

many of our subscription agreement require to indemnify our customer for third party intellectual property infringement claim which could increase the cost to of an adverse ruling on such claim the outcome of any claim or litigation regardless of the merit is inherently uncertain any claim and other lawsuit and the disposition of such claim and lawsuit whether through settlement or litigation

customer and partner impacted our business and result of operation and could further impact our result of operation and our cash flow in the future in response to the covid pandemic we have been guided by our core value of trust customer success innovation and equality beginning in the first fiscal quarter and through the remainder of fiscal we took action in response to the pandemic that focused on maintaining business continuity supporting our employee helping our customer and community and preparing for the future and the long term success of our business result of the pandemic we experienced slight decline in new business in the first quarter of fiscal compared to the same prior year period however new business grew during the remainder of fiscal at rate consistent with historical trend prior to covid in addition result of action taken by in response to the pandemic we experienced incremental operating expense and lower than expected operating cash flow for the full year of fiscal when compared to historical trend for example change in billing frequency for new business and investment in our go to market effort resulted in negative impact to our operating cash flow during the year in fiscal our income from operation benefited from our global work from home policy and limited business travel by our employee we continue to evaluate our office space need and

in increased internet demand which could cause access issue could affect our ability to develop and support product and service and could cause issue with access to data center the ultimate extent of

business lead the impact on our customer employee and industry event and the effect on our vendor all of which are uncertain and currently can not be predicted with any degree of certainty result the extent to which the covid pandemic will continue to impact our financial condition or result of operation is uncertain due to our primarily subscription based business model the effect of the covid pandemic may not be fully reflected in our result of operation until future period if the covid pandemic ha substantial impact on our employee partner or customer productivity our result of operation

key growth lever including driving multi cloud adoption increasing our penetration with enterprise and international customer and our industry specific reach with more vertical software solution these growth driver often require more sophisticated go to market approach and result we may incur additional cost upfront to obtain new customer and expand our relationship with existing customer including additional sale and marketing expense specific to subscription and support revenue result we have seen that customer with many of these characteristic have lower attrition rate than our company average of contentswe plan to continue to reinvest significant portion of our income from operation in future period to grow and innovate our business and service offering and expand our leadership role in the cloud computing industry we drive innovation organically and to lesser extent through acquisition we regularly evaluate acquisition and investment opportunity in complementary business joint venture service technology and intellectual property right in an effort to expand our service offering and to nurture the overall ecosystem for our offering past acquisition have enabled to deliver innovative solution in new category including analytics and integration we continue to evaluate investment opportunity and expect to continue to make investment and acquisition in the future such our pending acquisition of slack slack ha an integrated value proposition across all of our service offering and upon close of the transaction and successful product integration we believe it will further enable company to grow and succeed in an all digital work from anywhere era result of our aggressive growth plan and integration of our previously acquired business we have incurred significant expense for equity award and amortization of purchased intangible which have reduced our operating income we periodically make change to our sale organization to position for long term growth which ha in the past and could in the future result in temporary disruption to our sale productivity in addition we have experienced and may at time in the future experience more variation from our forecasted expectation of new business activity due to longer and le predictable sale cycle and increasing complexity of our business which includes an expanded mix of product and various revenue model resulting from acquisition and increased enterprise solution selling activity slower growth in new business in given period could negatively affect our revenue in future period well remaining performance obligation in current or future period particularly if experienced on sustained basis the expanding global scope of our business and the heightened volatility of global market including result of covid expose to the risk of fluctuation in foreign currency market fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate had modest favorable impact on our revenue result for fiscal in addition fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate had modest favorable impact on both our remaining performance obligation and current remaining performance obligation of january we expect these fluctuation to continue in the future fiscal yearour fiscal year end on january reference to fiscal for example refer to the fiscal year ending january operating segmentswe operate one segment see note summary of business and significant accounting policy to the consolidated financial statement for our discussion about segment source of revenueswe derive our revenue from two source subscription and support revenue and related professional service subscription and support revenue accounted for approximately percent of our total revenue for fiscal subscription and support revenue are primarily comprised of subscription fee from customer accessing our enterprise cloud computing service collectively cloud service cloud service allow customer to use our multi tenant software without taking possession of the software revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term with the may acquisition of mulesoft and the august acquisition of tableau subscription and support revenue also include revenue associated with software license software license revenue include fee from the sale of term and perpetual license revenue from software license are generally recognized upfront when the software is made available to the customer and revenue from the related support are generally recognized ratably over the contract term change in contract duration for multi year license can impact the amount of revenue recognized upfront revenue from software license represent le than ten percent of total subscription and support revenue for fiscal the revenue growth rate of each of our service offering described below in result of operation fluctuate from quarter to quarter and over time additionally we manage the total balanced product portfolio to deliver solution to our customer and result the revenue result for each offering is not necessarily indicative of the result to be expected for any subsequent quarter in addition some of our cloud service offering have similar feature and function for example customer may use our sale service or platform service offering to record account and contact information which are similar feature across these service offering depending on customer actual and projected business requirement more than one service offering may satisfy the customer current and future need we record revenue based on the individual product ordered by customer not according to the customer business requirement and usage our growth in revenue is also impacted by attrition attrition represents the reduction or loss of the annualized value of our contract with customer we calculate our attrition rate at point in time on trailing twelve month basis of the end of each month of january our attrition rate excluding our integration service offering salesforce org and tableau of contentswas between and prior to fiscal year our attrition rate excluded our commerce service offering in general we exclude service offering from acquisition from our attrition calculation until they are fully integrated into our customer success organization while our attrition rate is difficult to predict we expect it to remain consistent or slightly better in the near term due to the diversity of size industry and geography within the customer base however our attrition rate may increase over time including for example result of covid we continue to invest in variety of customer program and initiative which along with increasing enterprise adoption have helped keep our attrition rate consistent compared to the prior year consistent attrition rate play role in our ability to maintain growth in our subscription and support revenue seasonal nature of unearned revenue account receivable and operating cash flowunearned revenue primarily consists of billing to customer for our subscription service over percent of the value of our billing to customer is for our subscription and support service we generally invoice our customer in advance in annual installment and typical payment term provide that our customer pay within day of invoice amount that have been invoiced are recorded in account receivable and in unearned revenue or in revenue depending on whether transfer of control to customer ha occurred in general we collect our billing in advance of the subscription service period we typically issue renewal invoice in advance of the renewal service period and depending on timing the initial invoice for the subscription and service contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarter there is disproportionate weighting toward annual billing in the fourth quarter primarily result of large enterprise account buying pattern our fourth quarter ha historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewal the year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing pattern and overall new and renewal business cause the value of invoice that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewal to increase proportion of our total annual billing accordingly because of this billing activity our first quarter is typically our largest collection and operating cash flow quarter conversely our third quarter ha historically been our smallest operating cash flow quarter in response to covid we offered temporary financial flexibility to some customer in the first quarter of fiscal and changed billing frequency for other customer throughout fiscal which ha delayed payment to period later than expected we also have accelerated our investment in our go to market and product effort throughout fiscal which resulted in increased expense and negative impact to operating cash flow these effort have affected and may continue to affect trend related to the seasonal nature of unearned revenue account receivable and operating cash flow unearned revenue account receivable and operating cash flow may also be impacted by acquisition for example operating cash flow may be adversely impacted by acquisition due to transaction cost financing cost such interest expense and lower operating cash flow from the acquired entity the sequential quarterly change in account receivable and the related unearned revenue and operating cash flow during the first quarter of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs for the following quarter displayed below in million of contentsremaining performance obligation our remaining performance obligation represents all future revenue under contract that ha not yet been recognized revenue and includes unearned revenue and unbilled amount our current remaining performance obligation represents future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized revenue in the next month remaining performance obligation is not necessarily indicative of future revenue growth and is influenced by several factor including seasonality the timing of renewal average contract term foreign currency exchange rate and fluctuation in new business growth remaining performance obligation is also impacted by acquisition unbilled portion of the remaining performance obligation denominated in foreign currency are revalued each period based on the period end exchange rate for multi year subscription agreement billed annually the associated unbilled balance and corresponding remaining performance obligation are typically high at the beginning of the contract period zero prior to renewal and increase if the agreement is renewed low remaining performance obligation attributable to particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal but may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer change in contract duration can impact remaining performance obligation and current remaining performance obligation remaining performance obligation consisted of the following in billion of contentscost of revenue and operating expensesimpact of acquisitionsthe comparability of our operating result is impacted by our recent acquisition including our acquisition of vlocity in june and our acquisition of tableau in august expense contribution by expense type from our recent acquisition generally may not be separately identifiable due to the integration of these business into our existing operation or may be insignificant to our result of operation during the period presented cost of revenuescost of subscription and support revenue primarily consists of expense related to delivering our service and providing support including the cost of data center capacity certain fee paid to various third party for the use of their technology service and data and employee related cost such salary and benefit cost of professional service and other revenue consists primarily of employee related cost associated with these service including stock based expense the cost of subcontractor and certain third party fee we expect the cost of professional service to be approximately in line with revenue from professional service in future fiscal period we believe that this investment in professional service facilitates the adoption of our service offering research and developmentresearch and development expense consist primarily of salary and related expense including stock based expense and allocated overhead marketing and sale marketing and sale expense make up the majority of our operating expense and consist primarily of salary and related expense including stock based expense and commission for our sale and marketing staff well payment to partner marketing program and allocated overhead marketing program consist of advertising event corporate communication brand building and product marketing activity we capitalize certain cost to obtain customer contract such commission and amortize these cost on straight line basis payment of these commission are not consistent with the period in which the expense is recognized general and administrative general and administrative expense consist primarily of salary and related expense including stock based expense for finance and accounting legal internal audit human resource and management information system personnel and professional service fee of contentscritical accounting policy and estimatesour consolidated financial statement are prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state the preparation of these consolidated financial statement requires to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue cost and expense and related disclosure on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimate and assumption our actual result may differ from these estimate under different assumption or condition we believe that of our significant accounting policy which are described in note summary of business and significant accounting policy to our consolidated financial statement the following accounting policy and specific estimate involve greater degree of judgment and complexity revenue recognition contract with multiple performance obligation we enter into contract with our customer that may include promise to transfer multiple cloud service software license premium support and professional service performance obligation is promise in contract with customer to transfer product or service that are distinct determining whether product and service are distinct performance obligation that should be accounted for separately or combined one unit of accounting may require significant judgment cloud service and software license are distinct such offering are often sold separately in determining whether professional service are distinct we consider the following factor for each professional service agreement availability of the service from other vendor the nature of the professional service the timing of when the professional service contract wa signed in comparison to the subscription start date and the contractual dependence of the service on the customer satisfaction with the professional service work to date we have concluded that professional service included in contract with multiple performance obligation are generally distinct we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on relative standalone selling price ssp basis the ssp is the price at which we would sell promised product or service separately to customer judgment is required to determine the ssp for each distinct performance obligation we determine ssp by considering our overall pricing objective and market condition significant pricing practice taken into consideration include our discounting practice the size and volume of our transaction the customer demographic the geographic area where service are sold price list our go to market strategy historical sale and contract price in instance where we do not sell or price product or service separately we determine relative fair value using information that may include market condition or other observable input our go to market strategy evolve we may modify our pricing practice in the future which could result in change to ssp in certain case we are able to establish ssp based on observable price of product or service sold separately in comparable circumstance to similar customer we use single amount to estimate ssp when it ha observable price if ssp is not directly observable for example when pricing is highly variable we use range of ssp we determine the ssp range using information that may include pricing practice or other observable input we typically have more than one ssp for individual product and service due to the stratification of those product and service by customer size and geography cost capitalized to obtain revenue contract cost capitalized related to new revenue contract are amortized on straight line basis over four year which although longer than the typical initial contract period reflects the average period of benefit including expected contract renewal significant judgment is required in arriving at this average period of benefit therefore we evaluate both qualitative and quantitative factor including the estimated life cycle of our offering and our customer attrition business combination accounting for business combination requires to make significant estimate and assumption especially at the acquisition date with respect to tangible and intangible asset acquired and liability assumed and pre acquisition contingency we use our best estimate and assumption to accurately assign fair value to the tangible and intangible asset acquired and liability assumed at the acquisition date well the useful life of those acquired intangible asset critical estimate in valuing certain of the intangible asset and goodwill we have acquired are future expected cash flow from subscription and support contract professional service contract other customer contract and acquired developed technology and patent historical and expected customer attrition rate and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customer assumption about the period of time the acquired trade name will continue to be used in our offering discount rate uncertain tax position and tax related valuation allowance assumed fair value of assumed equity award and fair value of pre existing relationship unanticipated event and circumstance may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumption estimate or actual result of contentsincome tax valuation allowance are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax asset to the amount that are more likely than not expected to be realized based on the weighting of positive and negative evidence future realization of deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character for example ordinary income or capital gain within the carryback or carryforward period available under the applicable tax law we regularly review the deferred tax asset for recoverability based on historical taxable income projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary difference and tax planning strategy our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to many factor including future market condition and the ability to successfully execute our business plan and tax planning strategy should there be change in the ability to recover deferred tax asset our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed our tax position are subject to income tax audit by multiple tax jurisdiction throughout the world we recognize the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable upon examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merit the tax benefit recognized is measured the largest amount of benefit which is greater than percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the taxing authority we recognize interest accrued and penalty related to unrecognized tax benefit in our income tax provision in fiscal we changed our international corporate structure which included the transfer of certain intangible property between foreign affiliate resulting in net tax benefit of billion related to foreign deferred tax asset the deferred tax asset were recognized result of the book and tax basis difference on the intangible property and were based on the intangible property current fair value in determining the estimated fair value of the intangible property we made significant estimate and assumption including but not limited to projected revenue operating expense and geographic earnings mix in the valuation model we believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized and will regularly evaluate it realizability strategic investment accounting for strategic investment in privately held debt and equity security in which we do not have controlling interest or significant influence requires to make significant estimate and assumption valuation of privately held security are inherently complex and require judgment due to the lack of readily available market data privately held debt and equity security are valued using significant unobservable input or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market price and inherent lack of liquidity the carrying value of our privately held equity security are adjusted if there are observable price change in same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are identified event or change in circumstance that may indicate impairment discussed below in determining the estimated fair value of our strategic investment in privately held company we utilize the most recent data available adjusted to reflect the specific right and preference of those security we hold we ass our privately held debt and equity security strategic investment portfolio quarterly for impairment our impairment analysis encompasses an assessment of both qualitative and quantitative analysis of key factor including the investee financial metric market acceptance of the product or technology and the rate at which the investee is using it cash if the investment is considered to be impaired we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment through the consolidated statement of operation and establishing new carrying value for the investment the particular privately held debt and equity security we hold and their right and preference relative to those of other security within the capital structure may impact the magnitude by which our investment value move in relation to movement of the total enterprise value of the company result our investment value in specific

and qualitative disclosure about market riskwe are exposed to financial market risk including change in foreign currency exchange rate interest rate and equity investment risk this exposure ha increased due to recent financial market movement and change to our expectation of near term possible movement caused by the impact of covid discussed in more detail below foreign currency exchange riskwe primarily conduct our business in the following location the united state europe canada latin america asia pacific and japan the expanding global scope of our business expose to the risk of fluctuation in foreign currency market including emerging market this exposure is the result of selling in multiple currency growth in our international investment including data center expansion cost associated with third party infrastructure provider additional headcount in foreign country and operating in country where the functional currency is the local currency specifically our result of operation and cash flow are subject to fluctuation in the following currency the euro british pound sterling japanese yen canadian dollar australian dollar and brazilian real against the united state dollar usd these exposure may change over time business practice evolve and economic condition change including market impact associated with covid change in foreign currency exchange rate could have an adverse impact on our financial result and cash flow in fiscal we began transitioning away from our uk centralized european structure to enable some of our local subsidiary within europe including germany and france to invoice customer directly this transition which may take multiple year is expected to enable local subsidiary to recognize revenue operating expense and corresponding balance sheet account in local currency with the change to local invoicing in some market we expect better alignment between our revenue and expense in the local currency in january the uk exited the european union eu brexit in december trade agreement wa entered into between the uk and the eu and in january the transition period ended and the uk wa no longer subject to eu rule or regulation brexit and the new uk eu trade agreement could adversely affect the uk regional including european and worldwide economic and market condition and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange market including volatility in the value of the british pound sterling and euro we have evaluated and started to implement initiative such the commitment to invest resource in dublin ireland that could partially mitigate the impact brexit could have on our operation in fiscal and revenue generated in europe were approximately percent and percent of total revenue respectively of which most are recorded in our uk germany france italy spain and ireland subsidiary revenue in europe had minimal favorable impact in fiscal compared to fiscal result of fluctuation in the euro and british pound sterling against the usd we recognize that there are still significant uncertainty surrounding the ultimate resolution of brexit negotiation and we will continue to monitor any change that may arise and ass their potential impact on our business foreign currency transaction riskour foreign currency exposure typically arise from selling annual and multi year subscription in multiple currency customer account receivable intercompany transfer pricing arrangement and other intercompany transaction our foreign currency management objective is to minimize the effect of fluctuation in foreign exchange rate on selected asset or liability without exposing to additional risk associated with transaction that could be regarded speculative we pursue our objective by utilizing foreign currency forward contract to offset foreign exchange risk our foreign currency forward contract are generally short term in duration we neither use these foreign currency forward contract for trading purpose nor do we currently designate these forward contract hedging instrument pursuant to accounting standard codification derivative and hedging accordingly we record the fair value of these contract of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with change in fair value recorded to our consolidated statement of operation given the short duration of the forward contract the amount recorded is not significant our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposure will generally depend on the size and type of cross currency transaction that we enter into the currency exchange rate associated with these exposure and change in those rate the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contract and other factor foreign currency translation riskfluctuations in foreign currency impact the amount of total asset liability revenue operating expense and cash flow that we report for our foreign subsidiary upon the translation of these amount into usd although the usd fluctuated against certain international currency throughout the year the amount of revenue that we reported in usd for foreign subsidiary that transact in international currency were similar to what we would have reported during fiscal using constant currency rate however fluctuation in usd against certain international currency over the past several month modestly benefited our remaining performance obligation of january compared to what we would have reported of january using constant currency rate of contentsinterest rate sensitivitywe had cash

security with credit rating of at least bbb or better the cash cash equivalent and marketable security are held for general corporate purpose including acquisition of or investment in complementary business service or technology working capital and capital expenditure our investment are made for capital preservation purpose we do not enter into investment for trading or speculative purpose our cash equivalent and our portfolio of marketable security are subject to market risk due to change in interest rate fixed rate security may have their market value adversely impacted due to rise in interest rate while floating rate security may produce le income than expected if interest rate fall due in part to these factor our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to change in interest rate or we may suffer loss in principal if we are forced to sell security that decline in market value due to change in interest rate however because we classify our debt security available for sale no gain or loss are recognized due to change in interest rate unless such security are sold prior to maturity or due to expected credit loss our fixed income portfolio is also subject to interest rate risk an immediate increase or decrease in interest rate of basis point at january could result in million market value reduction or increase of the same amount this estimate is based on sensitivity model that measure market value change when change in interest rate occur fluctuation in the value of our investment security caused by change in interest rate gain or loss on the carrying value are recorded in other comprehensive income and are realized only if we sell the underlying security at january we had cash cash equivalent and marketable security totaling billion

strategic investment in privately held and publicly traded company which range from early stage company to more mature company both domestically and internationally including in emerging market we

change our investment strategy and corresponding investment opportunity have expanded to include investment in company concurrently with their initial public offering well larger capital investment in late stage company we plan to continue these type of strategic investment including in company representing targeted geography and targeted business and technological initiative opportunity arise that

invested unrealized gain cumulative unrealized loss cumulative carrying value of january held equity security privately held equity security total equity security we anticipate additional volatility to our consolidated statement of operation due to change in market price observable price change and impairment to our investment these change could be material based on market condition and event while historically our investment portfolio ha had positive impact on our financial result that may not be true for future period particularly in period of significant market fluctuation that affect our equity security within our strategic investment portfolio volatility in the global market condition including recent and ongoing volatility related to the impact of covid and related public health measure may impact our investment portfolio and our financial result may fluctuate from historical result and expectation our investment in privately held security are in various class of equity which may have different right and preference the particular security we hold and their right and preference relative to those of other security within the capital structure may impact the magnitude by which our investment value move in relation to movement of the total enterprise value of the company result our investment value in specific company may move by more or le than any change in value of that overall company an immediate decrease of ten percent in enterprise value of our publicly traded and significant privately held equity security held of january which represents percent of the strategic investment portfolio could result in million reduction in the value of our investment portfolio fluctuation in the value of our privately held equity investment are only recorded when there is an observable transaction for same or similar investment of the same issuer or in the event of impairment we continually evaluate our investment in privately held and publicly traded company in certain case our ability to sell these investment may be impacted by contractual obligation to hold the security for set period of time after public offering one of our publicly traded investment
