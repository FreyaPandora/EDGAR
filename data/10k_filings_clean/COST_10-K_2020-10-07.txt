amount in million except per share share membership fee and warehouse count data overviewwe believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sale particularly comparable sale growth net sale includes our core merchandise category food and sundries hardlines softlines and fresh food warehouse ancillary and other business we define comparable sale net sale from warehouse open for more than one year including remodels relocation and expansion and sale related to commerce website operating for more than one year comparable sale growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing member and the amount they spend on each visit average ticket sale comparison can also be particularly influenced by certain factor that are beyond our control fluctuation in currency exchange rate with respect to the consolidation of the result of our international operation and change in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive condition primarily impacting our and canadian operation the higher our comparable sale exclusive of these item the more we can leverage certain of our selling general and administrative sg expense reducing them percentage of sale and enhancing profitability generating comparable sale growth is foremost question of making available to our member the right merchandise at the right price skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term another substantial factor in net sale growth is the health of the economy in which we do business including the effect of inflation or deflation especially the united state net sale growth and gross margin are also impacted by our competition which is vigorous and widespread across wide range of global national and regional wholesaler and retailer including those with commerce operation while we can not control or reliably predict general economic health or change in competition we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these change such through adjustment to our pricing and merchandise mix including increasing the penetration of our private label item and through online offering our philosophy is to provide our member with quality good and service at competitive price we do not focus in the short term on maximizing price charged but instead seek to maintain we believe is perception among our member of our pricing authority on quality good consistently providing the most competitive value our investment in merchandise pricing may include reducing price on merchandise to drive sale or meet competition and holding price steady despite cost increase instead of passing the increase on to our member all negatively impacting gross margin percentage of net sale gross margin percentage we believe our gasoline business draw member but it generally ha lower gross margin percentage relative to our non gasoline business it also ha lower sg expense percent of net sale compared to our non gasoline business higher penetration of gasoline sale will generally lower our gross margin percentage rapidly changing gasoline price may significantly impact our near term net sale growth generally rising gasoline price benefit net sale growth which given the higher sale base negatively impact our gross margin percentage but decrease our sg expense percentage of net sale decline in gasoline price ha the inverse effect additionally action in various country particularly china and the united state have created uncertainty with respect to tariff will affect the cost of some of our merchandise the degree of our exposure is dependent on among other thing the type of good rate imposed and timing of the tariff the impact to our net sale and gross margin will be influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategy in response to cost increase while these potential impact are uncertain they could have an adverse impact on our result we also achieve net sale growth by opening new warehouse our warehouse base grows available and desirable site become more difficult to secure and square footage growth becomes comparatively le substantial component of growth the negative aspect of such growth however including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouse and cannibalization of sale at existing warehouse when opening occur in existing market are continuing to decline in significance they relate to the result of our total operation our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in foreign market due to the smaller base in those market and we expect that to of contentscontinue our commerce business growth domestically and internationally ha also increased our sale but it generally ha lower gross margin percentage relative to our warehouse business the membership format is an integral part of our business and ha significant effect on our profitability this format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue the extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base increase the penetration of our executive member and sustain high renewal rate materially influence our profitability our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse opening occur in existing market compared to new market our financial performance depends heavily on controlling cost while we believe that we have achieved success in this area some significant cost are partially outside our control particularly health care and utility expense with respect to the compensation of our employee our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wage and benefit rather we believe that achieving our longer term objective of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation level that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce this may cause for example to absorb cost that other employer might seek to pas through to their workforce because our business operates on very low margin modest change in various item in the consolidated statement of income particularly merchandise cost and selling general and administrative expense can have substantial impact on net income our operating model is generally the same across our canada and other international operating segment see note to the consolidated financial statement included in item of this report certain country in the other international segment have relatively higher rate of square footage growth lower wage and benefit cost percentage of country sale le or no direct membership warehouse competition and may lack an commerce business in discussion of our consolidated operating result we refer to the impact of change in
