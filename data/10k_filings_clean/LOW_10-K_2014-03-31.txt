deflation of commodity price natural disaster and act of both domestic and international terrorism the sluggish and uneven pace of the recovery from the deep global recession could continue to have an adverse effect on the rate of growth of discretionary spending by consumer and the share of such spending on home improvement product and service adverse change in economic factor specific to the home improvement industry may negatively impact the rate of growth of our total sale and comparable sale sale of many of our product category and service are driven by the activity level of home improvement project although the housing market ha been strengthened by favorable interest rate and lower home price the large number of household that continue to have little available equity mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rate that remain abnormally high tighter restriction on the availability of mortgage financing slower household formation growth rate and lower growth in housing

instability among key vendor political instability or labor unrest in source country retaliatory trade restriction imposed by either the united state or major source country tariff currency exchange rate and transport capacity and cost are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupted the movement of product through our supply chain or increased their

position and our employee and independent contractor such third party installers and repair technician will not only have to understand non traditional selling platform but also commit to fundamental change in lowe culture and the process through which they have traditionally interacted with customer to the extent they are unable or unwilling to make these transformational change we may be unable to operationalize our strategic initiative which are designed to increase our sale and capture greater percentage of our customer expenditure on home improvement project the many challenge our management face we adapt our business model also increase the risk that we may not achieve our objective if we fail to hire train manage and retain qualified sale associate and specialist with

exist for calculating roic accordingly the method used by our management to calculate roic may differ from the method other company use to calculate their roic we encourage to understand the method

greater long lived asset impairment and discontinued project expense in the prior year and eight basis point of leverage in advertising expense due to higher sale in addition we experienced eight basis point of leverage in contract labor expense result of lower spending on information technology project in the current year these were partially offset by basis point of deleverage associated

decrease in net cash used in financing activity for wa driven primarily by decrease in cash used to repurchase share which included share repurchased under our share repurchase program and share withheld from employee to satisfy statutory tax withholding liability upon vesting of restricted stock award the repayment of unsecured note that matured in the prior year and an increase in short

been insignificant represents commitment related to certain marketing and information technology program and purchase of merchandise inventory letter of credit are issued primarily for insurance and construction contract at january our reserve for uncertain tax position including penalty and interest wa million of which million wa classified current liability and million wa classified noncurrent liability at this time we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payment in individual year beyond month due to uncertainty in the timing of the effective settlement of tax position critical accounting policy and estimatesthe preparation of the consolidated financial statement and note to consolidated financial statement presented in this form requires to make estimate that affect the reported amount of asset liability sale and expense and related disclosure of contingent asset and liability we base these estimate on historical result and various other assumption believed to be reasonable all of which form the basis for making estimate concerning the carrying value of asset and liability that are not readily available from other source actual result may differ from these estimate of contentsour significant accounting policy are described in note to the consolidated financial statement we believe that the following accounting policy affect the most significant estimate and management judgment used in preparing the consolidated financial statement merchandise inventorydescriptionwe record an obsolete inventory reserve for the anticipated loss associated with selling inventory below cost this reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory level sale trend and historical experience during our reserve increased approximately million to million of january we also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventory this reserve is based primarily on actual shrinkage result from previous physical inventory during the inventory shrinkage reserve increased approximately million to million of january in addition we receive fund from vendor in the normal course of business principally result of purchase volume sale early payment or promotion of vendor product generally these vendor fund do not represent the reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable cost that we incurred to sell the vendor product therefore we treat these fund reduction in the cost of inventory the amount are accrued and recognize these fund reduction of cost of sale when the inventory is sold fund that are determined to be reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable cost incurred to sell vendor product are recorded an offset to the related expense judgment and uncertainty involved in the estimatewe do not believe that our merchandise inventory are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practice based on anticipated sale trend and general economic condition however change in consumer purchasing pattern or deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserve likewise change in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary based on the timing and result of physical inventory we also apply judgment in the determination of level of non productive inventory and assumption about net realizable value for vendor fund we develop accrual rate based on the provision of the agreement in place due to the complexity and diversity of the individual vendor agreement we perform analysis and review historical purchase trend and volume throughout the year adjust accrual rate appropriate and confirm actual amount with select vendor to ensure the amount earned are appropriately recorded amount accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volume differ from projected purchase volume especially in the case of program that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volume are met effect if actual result differ from assumptionswe have not made any material change in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserve for obsolete inventory or inventory shrinkage during the past three fiscal year we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimate for both of these inventory reserve however it is possible that actual result could differ from recorded reserve change in either the amount of product considered obsolete or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our obsolete inventory reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately million for change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrinkage reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately million for we have not made any material change in the methodology used to recognize vendor fund during the past three fiscal year if actual result are not consistent with the assumption and estimate used we could be exposed to additional adjustment that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory however substantially all receivables associated with these activity do not require subjective long term estimate because they are collected within the following fiscal year adjustment to gross margin and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material long lived asset impairmentdescriptionwe review the carrying amount of location whenever certain event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable when evaluating location for impairment our asset group is at an individual location level that is the lowest level for which cash flow are identifiable cash flow for individual location do not include an allocation of corporate overhead of contentswe evaluate location for triggering event relating to long lived asset impairment on quarterly basis to determine when location asset carrying value may not be recoverable for operating location our primary indicator that asset carrying value may not be recoverable is consistently negative cash flow for month period for those location that have been open in the location for sufficient period of time to allow for meaningful analysis of ongoing operating result management also monitor other factor when evaluating operating location for impairment including individual location execution of their operating plan and local market condition including incursion which is the opening of either other lowe location or those of direct competitor within the same market we also consider there to be triggering event when there is current expectation that it is more likely than not that given location will be closed significantly before the end of it previously estimated useful life potential impairment ha occurred if projected future undiscounted cash flow expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the location asset are le than the carrying amount of the asset when determining the stream of projected future cash flow associated with an individual operating location management make assumption incorporating local market condition about key store variable including sale growth rate gross margin and controllable expense such store payroll and occupancy expense well asset residual value or lease rate an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the operating location is not recoverable and exceeds it fair value we use an income approach to determine the fair value of our individual operating location which requires discounting projected future cash flow this involves making assumption regarding both location future cash flow described above and an appropriate discount rate to determine the present value of those future cash flow we discount our cash flow estimate at rate commensurate with the risk that selected market participant would assign to the cash flow the selected market participant represent group of other retailer with market footprint similar in size to ours judgment and uncertainty involved in the estimateour impairment evaluation require to apply judgment in determining whether triggering event ha occurred including the evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that location will be closed significantly before the end of it previously estimated useful life our impairment loss calculation require to apply judgment in estimating expected future cash flow including estimated sale margin and controllable expense and assumption about market performance for operating location and estimated selling price or lease rate for location identified for closure we also apply judgment in estimating asset fair value including the selection of an appropriate discount rate for fair value determined using an income approach effect if actual result differ from assumptionsduring operating location experienced triggering event and were evaluated for recoverability one of the operating location wa determined to be impaired we recorded impairment loss related to this operating location of million during compared to impairment loss on operating location of million during we have not made any material change in the methodology used to estimate the future cash flow of operating location or location identified for closure during the past three fiscal year if the actual result are not consistent with the assumption and judgment we have made in determining whether it is more likely than not that location will be closed significantly before the end of it useful life or in estimating future cash flow and determining asset fair value our actual impairment loss could vary positively or negatively from our estimated impairment loss fourteen of the operating location that experienced triggering event during were determined to be recoverable and therefore were not impaired for of these location the expected undiscounted cash flow substantially exceeded the net book value of the location asset for these location reduction in projected sale used to estimate future cash flow at the latest date these operating location were evaluated for impairment would have resulted in the impairment of four of these location and increased recognized impairment loss by million three of the operating location with net book value of million had expected undiscounted cash flow that exceeded the net book value of it asset by le than substantial amount reduction in projected sale used to estimate future cash flow at the date these operating location were evaluated for impairment would have resulted in the impairment of these three location and increased recognized impairment loss by million we analyzed other assumption made in estimating the future cash flow of the operating location evaluated for impairment but the sensitivity of those assumption wa not significant to the estimate of contentsstore closing lease obligationsdescriptionwhen location under operating lease are closed we recognize liability for the fair value of future contractual obligation associated with the leased location the fair value of the store closing lease obligation is determined using an expected present value cash flow model incorporating future minimum lease payment property tax utility common area maintenance and other ongoing expense net of estimated sublease income and other recoverable item discounted at credit adjusted risk free rate the expected present value cash flow model us probability weighted scenario approach that assigns varying cash flow to certain scenario based on the expected likelihood of outcome estimating the fair value involves making assumption regarding estimated sublease income by obtaining information from property broker or appraiser in the specific market being evaluated the information includes comparable lease rate of similar asset and assumption about demand in the market for leasing these asset subsequent change to the liability including change resulting from revision to either the timing or the amount of estimated cash flow are recognized in the period of the change judgment and uncertainty involved in the estimateour store closing lease

actual result differ from assumptionsduring the company relocated two store subject to operating lease during one store wa relocated we recorded million of expense for store closing lease obligation during both and for these charge included million related to location closed or relocated during and million of adjustment related to previously closed or relocated location we have not made any material change in the methodology used to estimate the expected future cash flow of closed location under operating lease during the past three fiscal year if the actual result are not consistent with the assumption and judgment we have made in estimating expected future cash flow our store closing lease obligation loss could vary positively or negatively from our estimated loss change in the

assumptionswe have not made any material change in the methodology used to establish our self insurance liability during the past three fiscal year although we believe that we have the ability to reasonably estimate loss related to claim it is possible that actual result could differ from recorded self insurance liability change in our self insurance liability would have affected net earnings by approximately million for basis point change in our discount rate would have affected net earnings by approximately million for of contentsrevenue recognitiondescriptionsee note to the consolidated financial statement for discussion of our revenue recognition policy the following accounting estimate relating to revenue recognition require management to make assumption and apply judgment regarding the effect of future event that can not be determined with certainty we sell separately priced extended protection plan contract under lowe branded program for which the company is ultimately self insured the company recognizes revenue from extended protection plan sale on straight line basis over the respective contract term extended protection plan contract term primarily range from one to four year from the date of purchase or the end of the manufacturer warranty applicable the company consistently group and evaluates extended protection plan contract based on the characteristic of the underlying product and the coverage provided in order to monitor for expected loss loss on the overall contract would be recognized if the expected cost of performing service under the contract exceeded the amount of unamortized acquisition cost and related deferred revenue associated with the contract deferred revenue associated with the extended protection plan contract increased million to million of january we defer revenue and cost of sale associated with settled transaction for which customer have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation ha not yet been completed revenue is deferred based on the actual amount received we use historical gross margin rate to estimate the adjustment to cost of sale for these transaction during deferred revenue associated with these transaction increased million to million of january judgment and uncertainty involved in the estimatefor extended protection plan there is judgment inherent in our evaluation of expected loss result of our methodology for grouping and evaluating extended protection plan contract and from the actuarial determination of the estimated cost of the contract there is also judgment inherent in our determination of the recognition pattern of cost of performing service under these contract for the deferral of revenue and cost of sale associated with transaction for which customer have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation ha not yet been completed there is judgment inherent in our estimate of gross margin rate effect if actual result differ from assumptionswe have not made any material change in the methodology used to recognize revenue on our extended protection plan contract during the past three fiscal year we currently do not anticipate incurring any overall contract loss on our extended protection plan contract although we believe that we have the ability to adequately monitor and estimate expected loss under the extended protection plan contract it is possible that actual result could differ from our estimate in addition if future evidence indicates that the cost of performing service under these contract are incurred on other than straight line basis the timing of revenue recognition under these contract could change change in the amount of revenue recognized in under these contract would have affected net earnings by approximately million we have not made any material change in the methodology used to reverse net sale and cost of sale related to amount received for which customer have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation ha not yet been completed we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimate related to the impact to cost of sale for these transaction however if actual result are not consistent with our estimate or assumption we may incur additional income or expense change in the estimate of the gross margin rate applied to these transaction would have affected net earnings by approximately million in disclosure regarding forward looking statementswe speak throughout this annual report on form in forward

projection of future profitability for evidence of possible impairment an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the asset disposal group is not recoverable and exceeds it fair value the company estimated the fair value of asset subject to long lived asset impairment based on the company own judgment about the assumption that market participant would use in pricing the asset and on observable market data when available the company classified these fair value measurement level in the determination of impairment for operating location the company determined the fair value
