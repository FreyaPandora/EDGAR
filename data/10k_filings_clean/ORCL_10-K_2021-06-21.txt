we compete with existing competitor well firm that may be partner in other area of our business and other firm with whom we have not previously competed moreover we or our competitor may take certain strategic action including acquisition partnership and joint venture or repositioning of product line which invite even greater competition in one or more product offering category key competitive factor in each of the segment in which we currently compete and may compete in the future include total cost of ownership performance scalability reliability security functionality efficiency ease of use speed to production and quality of technical support our product and service sale and the relative strength of our product and service versus those of our competitor are also directly and indirectly affected by the following among other factor market adoption of cloud based it offering including saas and iaa offering the ease of deployment use transacting for and maintenance of our product and service offering compatibility between oracle product and service deployed within local it environment and public cloud it environment including our oracle cloud environment the adoption of commodity server and microprocessor the broader platform competition between our industry standard java technology platform and the net programming environment of microsoft operating system competition among our oracle solaris and linux operating system with alternative including microsoft window server and other unix and linux operating system the adoption of open source alternative to

changing economic and technological environment that present numerous risk many of which are driven by factor that we can not control or predict the following discussion well our critical accounting policy and estimate discussion in item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation highlight some of these risk the risk described below are not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risk and uncertainty before investing in our security business and operational risk the covid pandemic ha affected how we and our customer are operating our respective business and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future result of operation remains uncertain the covid pandemic and effort to control it spread have materially affected how we our customer partner and supplier are operating our business our operation have been negatively affected by range of external factor related to the covid pandemic that are not within our control for example the covid pandemic ha led government to implement preventative measure to contain or control further spread of the virus such travel restriction prohibition of non essential activity quarantine work from home directive and shelter in place order these preventative measure led to sharp reduction in demand in certain industry in which our customer operate it is not clear what long term effect the covid pandemic will have on our business including the effect on our customer and prospect if we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of the covid pandemic effectively our business will be harmed during fiscal we cancelled some customer event and transformed others including oracle openworld to virtual event our shift to creating virtual customer event may not be successful and we may not be able to showcase our product well we have historically done through in person event or generate the customer interest opportunity and lead through these virtual event if we attempt to reintroduce large in person event we may not be able to do successfully and our customer may not be able or willing to attend them the condition caused by the covid pandemic initially adversely affected our customer willingness to purchase our product delayed prospective customer purchasing decision and in certain case resulted in delayed payment by existing customer there have also been and likely will continue to be delay in our supply chain the negative impact of the global covid pandemic on the broader global economy and related impact on our customer business operation and their demand for our product may continue into future fiscal period the covid pandemic may also heighten other risk described in this risk factor section our success depends upon our ability to develop new product and service integrate acquired product and service and enhance our existing product and service rapid technological advance intense competition changing delivery model and evolving standard in computer hardware and software development and communication infrastructure changing and increasingly sophisticated customer need and frequent new product introduction and enhancement characterize the industry in which we compete if we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated product and service enhance and improve our product offering and support service in timely manner or position and price our product and service to meet demand customer may not purchase or subscribe to our license hardware or cloud offering or renew license support hardware support or cloud subscription contract renewal of these contract are important to the growth of our business in addition we can not provide any assurance that the standard on which we choose to develop new product will allow to compete effectively for business opportunity in emerging area we have continued to refresh and release new offering of our cloud product and service machine learning and artificial intelligence are increasingly driving innovation in technology but if they fail to operate anticipated or our other product do not perform promised our business and reputation may be harmed in addition our business may be adversely affected if we do not continue to develop and release new or enhanced product and service within the anticipated time frame table of content index to financial statement infrastructure cost to deliver new or enhanced product and service take longer or result in greater cost than anticipated we are unable to increase our existing data center capacity or establish data center in new geographic location in timely manner to meet current or expected customer demand there is delay in market acceptance of and difficulty in transitioning new and existing customer to new enhanced or acquired product line or service there are change in information technology it trend that we do not adequately anticipate or address with our product development effort we do not optimize complementary product line and service in timely manner or we fail to adequately integrate support or enhance acquired product line or service our oracle cloud strategy including our oracle cloud software service and infrastructure service saas and iaa respectively and collectively oracle cloud service offering may adversely affect our revenue and profitability we provide our cloud and other offering to customer worldwide via deployment model that best suit their need including via our cloud based saas and iaa offering these business model continue to evolve we may not be able to compete effectively generate significant revenue or maintain the profitability of our cloud offering additionally the increasing prevalence of cloud and saas delivery model offered by and our competitor may unfavorably impact the pricing of our cloud and license offering if we do not successfully execute our cloud computing strategy or anticipate the cloud computing need of our customer our reputation cloud service provider could be harmed and our revenue and profitability could decline customer demand for our cloud offering increase we experience volatility in our reported revenue and operating result due to the difference in timing of revenue recognition between our cloud license and on premise license and hardware product arrangement relative to our cloud offering arrangement customer generally purchase our cloud offering on subscription basis and revenue from these offering are generally recognized ratably over the term of the subscription consequently any deterioration in sale activity associated with our cloud offering may not be immediately observable in our consolidated statement of operation this is in contrast to revenue associated with our license and hardware product arrangement which are generally recognized in full at the time of delivery of the related license and hardware product in addition we may not be able to accurately anticipate customer transition from or be able to sufficiently backfill reduced customer demand for our license hardware and support offering relative to the expected increase in customer adoption of and demand for our oracle cloud service which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability we might experience significant coding manufacturing or configuration error in our cloud license and hardware offering despite testing prior to the release and throughout the lifecycle of product or service our cloud license and hardware offering sometimes contain coding manufacturing or configuration error that can impact their function performance and security and result in other negative consequence the detection and correction of any error in released cloud license or hardware offering can be time consuming and costly error in our cloud license or hardware offering could affect their ability to properly function integrate or operate with other cloud license or hardware offering could result in service interruption delay or outage of our cloud offering could create security vulnerability in our product or service could delay the development or release of new product or service or new version of product or service and could adversely affect market acceptance of our product or service this includes third party software product or service incorporated into our own if we experience any of these error or if there are delay in releasing our cloud license or hardware offering or new version of these offering our sale could be affected and revenue could decline in addition we run oracle business operation well cloud and other service that we offer to our customer on our product and network therefore any flaw could affect our and our customer ability to conduct business operation and to ensure accuracy in financial process and reporting and may result in unanticipated cost enterprise customer rely on our cloud license and hardware offering and related service to run their business and error in our cloud license and hardware offering and related service could expose to product liability performance and warranty claim well significant harm to our brand and reputation which could impact our future sale table of content index to financial statement if we are unable to compete effectively the result of operation and prospect for our business could be harmed we face intense competition in all aspect of our business the nature of the it industry creates competitive landscape that is constantly evolving firm emerge expand or are acquired technology evolves and delivery model change many vendor spend amount in excess of what oracle spends to develop and market application and infrastructure technology including database middleware product application development tool business application collaboration product and business intelligence compute storage and networking product among others which compete with oracle application and infrastructure offering use of our competitor technology influence customer purchasing decision or creates an environment that make it le efficient to utilize or migrate to oracle product and service our competitor may also adopt business practice that provide customer access to competing product and service at risk profile that we may not generally find acceptable which may convince customer to purchase competitor product and service we could lose customer if our competitor introduce new competitive product add new functionality acquire competitive product reduce price better execute on their sale and marketing strategy offer more flexible business practice or form strategic alliance with other company merger consolidation or alliance among our competitor or acquisition of our competitor by large company may result in increased competition we may also face increasing competition from open source software initiative in which competitor may provide software and intellectual property for free existing or new competitor could gain sale opportunity or customer at our expense we may need to change our pricing model to compete successfully the intense competition we face in the sale of our product and service and general economic and business condition could put pressure on to change our price if our competitor offer deep discount on certain product or service or develop product that the marketplace considers more valuable we may need to lower price introduce pricing model and offering that are le favorable to or offer other favorable term in order to compete successfully any such change may reduce revenue and margin and could adversely affect operating result additionally the increasing prevalence of cloud delivery model offered by and our competitor may unfavorably impact the pricing of our other cloud and license hardware and service offering and we may also incur increased cloud delivery expense we expand our cloud operation and update our infrastructure all of which could reduce our revenue and or profitability our license support fee and hardware support fee are generally priced percentage of our net license fee and net new hardware product fee respectively our competitor may offer lower pricing on their support offering which could put pressure on to further discount our offering change to our price and pricing policy could cause our revenue to decline or be delayed our sale force implement and our customer adjust to the new pricing policy some of our competitor may bundle product for promotional purpose or long term pricing strategy commit to large customer deployment at price that are unprofitable or provide guarantee of price and product implementation these practice could over time significantly constrain the price that we can charge for certain of our product if we do not adapt our pricing model to reflect change in customer use of our product or change in customer demand our revenue could decrease the increase in open source software distribution may also cause to change our pricing model any failure to offer high quality technical support service may adversely affect our relationship with our customer and our financial result our customer depend on our support organization to resolve technical issue relating to our application and infrastructure offering we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short term increase in customer demand for support service or may be inefficient in our resolution of customer support issue increased customer demand for these service without corresponding revenue could increase cost and adversely affect our operating result any failure to maintain high quality technical support or market perception that we do not maintain high quality technical support could adversely affect our reputation our ability to sell and renew our application and infrastructure offering to existing and prospective customer and our business operating result and financial position our cloud offering and hardware offering are complex and if we can not successfully manage this complexity the result of these business will suffer we depend on supplier to develop manufacture and deliver on timely basis the necessary technology and component for our hardware product that we market and sell to our customer and that we use part of our cloud infrastructure to deliver our cloud offering and there are some technology and component that can only be purchased from single vendor due to price quality technology table of content index to financial statement availability or other business constraint result our supply chain operation could be disrupted or negatively impacted by industry consolidation and component constraint or shortage natural disaster political unrest public health crisis such the covid pandemic change to trade policy port stoppage or other transportation disruption or slowdown or other factor affecting the country or region where these single source component vendor are located or where the product are being shipped we may be unable to purchase these item from the respective single vendor on acceptable term or may experience significant shortage delay or quality issue in the delivery of necessary technology part or component from particular vendor if one or more of the risk described above occurs our cloud and license business and hardware business and related operating result could be materially and adversely affected we are susceptible to third party manufacturing and logistics delay which could result in the loss of sale and customer we outsource significant majority of our manufacturing assembly delivery and technology of and certain component design for our hardware product to variety of company many of which are located outside the from time to time these partner experience production problem or delay or can not meet our demand for product to reduce this risk we continue to explore additional third party manufacturing partner to drive supply chain continuity but finding additional manufacturing source in timely and cost effective manner is difficult third party manufacturing and logistics delay attributable to the effect of covid caused loss of sale during our fiscal ongoing or future delay in manufacturing could cause the loss of additional sale delayed revenue recognition or an increase in our hardware product expense all of which could adversely affect the margin of our cloud and license business and hardware business these challenge could arise if we alter our manufacturing strategy supplier or location our hardware revenue and profitability have declined and could continue to decline our hardware business may adversely affect our total revenue and overall profitability and related growth rate we may not achieve our estimated revenue profit or other financial projection with respect to our hardware business in timely manner or at all due to number of factor including change in our hardware offering technology and strategy including shifting factory location which could adversely affect supply and demand for our hardware product our hardware business ha higher expense percentage of revenue and thus ha been le profitable than our cloud and license business our focus on certain of our more profitable oracle engineered system and certain other hardware product we consider strategic and the de emphasis of certain of our lower profit margin commodity hardware product which could adversely affect our hardware revenue change in strategy and frequency for the development and introduction of new version or next generation of our hardware product that could adversely affect our hardware revenue general supply chain material shortage worldwide which were further exacerbated globally result of the covid pandemic greater risk of material charge that could adversely affect our operating result such potential write down and impairment of our inventory higher warranty expense than what we experience in our cloud and license and service business and amortization and potential impairment of intangible asset associated with our hardware business and decreased customer demand for related hardware support hardware product approach the end of their useful life which could adversely affect our hardware revenue our periodic workforce restructurings and reorganization can be disruptive we are currently restructuring our workforce and in the past we have restructured or made other adjustment to our workforce in response to management change product change performance issue change in strategy acquisition and other internal and external consideration these type of restructurings have resulted in increased restructuring cost and temporary reduced productivity while the employee adjusted to their new role and responsibility in addition we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth resource redeployment or cost saving benefit of these table of content index to financial statement restructurings or may not do so within the expected timeframe these effect could recur in connection with future acquisition and other restructurings and our revenue and other result of operation could be negatively affected we may lose key employee or may be unable to hire enough qualified employee we rely on hiring qualified employee and the continued service of our senior management including our chairman of the board of director chief technology officer and founder our chief executive officer other member of our executive team and other key employee in the technology industry there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business product development technical and other personnel in response to the covid pandemic and to ensure the safety of our employee we have temporarily closed the majority of our office in fiscal we moved our headquarters to austin texas and announced modern approach to work that may provide our employee more flexibility to choose where and how to work depending on their role this mean that when our office reopen after the covid pandemic many employee can choose their office location well continue to work from home some or all the time while we believe this may help engage with wider pool of talent and may help to retain employee who want or need more flexibility it could negatively impact employee productivity and it may present risk for our real estate portfolio and strategy we intend to reopen our office when it is safe to do so and local requirement allow but our employee who opt to return to the office may nevertheless be exposed to health risk which may expose to potential liability we may also experience increased compensation cost that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sale we may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel with rare exception we do not have long term employment or non competition agreement with our employee member of our senior management team have left oracle over the year for variety of reason and we can not guarantee that there will not be additional departure which may be disruptive to our operation we continually focus on improving our cost structure by hiring personnel in country where advanced technical expertise and other expertise are available at lower cost when we make adjustment to our workforce we may incur expense associated with workforce reduction that delay the benefit of more efficient workforce structure we may also experience increased competition for employee in these country the trend toward globalization continues which may affect our employee retention effort and increase our expense in an effort to offer competitive compensation program in addition change to immigration and labor law policy may adversely impact our access to technical and professional talent our general compensation program includes restricted stock unit and performance based equity which are important tool in attracting and retaining employee in our industry if our stock price performs poorly it may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract employee we continually evaluate our compensation practice and consider change from time to time such reducing the number of employee granted equity award or the number of equity award granted per employee and granting alternative form of stock based compensation which may have an impact on our ability to retain employee and the amount of stock based compensation expense that we record any change in our compensation practice or those of our competitor could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel our cloud and license and hardware indirect sale channel could affect our future operating result our cloud and license and hardware indirect channel network is comprised primarily of resellers system integrator implementers consultant education provider internet service provider network integrator and independent software vendor our relationship with these channel participant are important element of our cloud software and hardware marketing and sale effort our financial result could be adversely affected if our contract with channel participant were terminated if our relationship with channel participant were to deteriorate if any of our competitor enter into strategic relationship with or acquire significant channel participant if the financial condition or operation of our channel participant were to weaken or if the level of demand for our channel participant product and service were to decrease there can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining expanding or developing our relationship with channel participant if we are not successful we may lose sale opportunity customer and revenue table of content index to financial statement acquisition present many risk and we may not achieve the financial and strategic goal that were contemplated at the time of transaction we continue to review and consider strategic acquisition of company product service and technology we have selective and active acquisition program and we expect to continue to make acquisition in the future because acquisition have been an important element of our overall corporate strategy risk we may face in connection with our acquisition program include our ongoing business may be disrupted and our management attention may be diverted by acquisition transition or integration activity we may have difficulty managing an acquired company technology or line of business entering new market where we have no or limited direct prior experience or where competitor may have stronger market position or retaining key personnel from the acquired company an acquisition may not further our business strategy we expected we may not integrate an acquired company or technology successfully we expected we may impose our business practice or alter go to market strategy that adversely impact the acquired business or we may overpay for or otherwise not realize the expected return on our investment each or all of which could adversely affect our business or operating result and potentially cause impairment to asset that we recorded part of an acquisition including intangible asset and goodwill our operating result or financial condition may be adversely impacted by claim or liability that we assume from an acquired company or technology or that are otherwise related to an acquisition pre existing contractual relationship that we assume from an acquired company the termination or modification of which may be costly or disruptive to our business and unfavorable revenue recognition or other accounting treatment result of an acquired company business practice we may fail to identify or ass the magnitude of certain liability shortcoming or other circumstance prior to acquiring company or technology we may not realize any anticipated increase in our revenue from an acquisition for number of reason including if larger than predicted number of customer decline to renew their contract with the acquired company if we are unable to sell the acquired product or service offering to our customer base if acquired customer do not elect to purchase our technology due to differing business practice or if contract model utilized by an acquired company do not allow to recognize revenue in manner that is consistent with our current accounting practice we may have difficulty integrating acquired technology product service and their related supply chain operation with our existing line of business and related infrastructure we may have multiple product line or service offering result of our acquisition that are offered priced delivered and supported differently which could cause customer confusion and delay we may incur higher than anticipated cost to support develop and deliver acquired product or service for general and administrative function that support new business model or to comply with regulation applicable to an acquired business that are more complicated than we anticipated we may be unable to obtain timely approval from or may otherwise have certain limitation restriction penalty or other sanction imposed on by worker council or similar body under applicable employment law result of an acquisition we may be unable to obtain required approval from governmental authority under competition and antitrust law on timely basis if at all our use of cash to pay for acquisition may limit other potential us of our cash we may significantly increase our interest expense leverage and debt service requirement if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition and we may have to delay or not proceed with substantial table of content index to financial statement acquisition if we can not obtain the necessary funding to complete the acquisition in timely manner or on favorable term and we may experience additional or unexpected change in how we are required to account for our acquisition pursuant to generally accepted accounting principle including arrangement that we may assume in an acquisition the occurrence of any of these risk could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition or cash flow particularly in the case of larger acquisition or several concurrent acquisition data privacy security and intellectual property risk if our security measure for our product and service are compromised and result our data our customer data or our it system are accessed improperly made unavailable or improperly modified our product and service may be perceived vulnerable our brand and reputation could be damaged the it service we provide to our customer could be disrupted and customer may stop using our product and service any of which could reduce our revenue and earnings increase our expense and expose to legal claim and regulatory action our product and service including oracle cloud service store retrieve manipulate and manage third party data such our customer information and data well our own data we have reputation for secure and reliable product offering and related service and we have invested great deal of time and resource in protecting the integrity and security of our product service and the internal and external data that we manage nonetheless we believe that oracle in particular is an attractive target for computer hacker and other bad actor because oracle store and process large amount of data including in customer sector involving particularly sensitive data such health science financial service retail hospitality and the government we and our third party vendor are regularly subject to attempt by third party which may include individual or group of hacker and sophisticated organization such state sponsored organization nation state and individual sponsored by them to identify and exploit product and service vulnerability penetrate or bypass our security measure and gain unauthorized access to our or our customer partner and supplier software hardware and cloud offering network and system successful attempt by one of these malicious actor can lead to the compromise of personal information or the confidential information or data of oracle or our customer attempt of this nature typically involve it related virus worm and other malicious software program that attack network system product and service exploit potential security vulnerability of network system product and service create system disruption and cause shutdown or denial of service third party may attempt to fraudulently induce customer partner employee or supplier into disclosing sensitive information such user name password or other information in order to gain access to our data our customer supplier or partner data or the it system of oracle our customer supplier or partner our product and service including our oracle cloud service may also be accessed or modified improperly result of customer partner employee contractor or supplier error or malfeasance if cyber attack or other security incident result in unauthorized access to or modification of our customer or supplier data other external data our own data or our it system or if the service we provide to our customer are disrupted or if our product or service are reported to have or are perceived having security vulnerability we could incur significant expense and suffer significant damage to our brand and reputation if our customer lose confidence in the security and reliability of our product and service including our cloud offering and perceive them to not be secure they may decide to reduce or terminate their spend with in addition cyber attack and other security incident could lead to significant investigation and remediation cost loss or destruction of information interruption of our operation inappropriate use of proprietary and sensitive data lawsuit indemnity obligation regulatory investigation and financial penalty and claim and increased legal liability including in some case contractual cost related to customer notification and fraud monitoring our remediation effort may not be successful because the technique used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage it system change frequently grow more complex over time and often are not recognized until launched target we may be unable to anticipate or implement adequate measure to prevent such technique our internal it system continue to evolve and we are often early adopter of new technology however our business policy and internal security control may not keep pace with these change new threat table of content index to financial statement emerge in addition we often experience increased activity of this nature during time of instability including during the current covid pandemic when most of our employee are working from home and our operation may be more susceptible to malfeasance due to operational change instituted to comply with safety health and regulatory requirement among others we may not discover any security breach and loss of information for significant period of time after the security breach our product operate in conjunction with and are dependent on wide variety of third party product component and service if there is security vulnerability in one of these component and if there is security exploit targeting it we could face increased cost liability claim customer dissatisfaction reduced revenue or harm to our reputation or competitive position we also have an active acquisition program and have acquired number of company product service and technology over the year while we make significant effort to address any it security issue with respect to our acquired company we may still inherit such risk when we integrate these company within oracle our business practice with respect to data could give rise to operational interruption liability or reputational harm result of governmental regulation legal requirement or industry standard relating to privacy and data protection regulatory focus on privacy issue continues to increase and worldwide law and regulation concerning the handling of personal information expand and become more complex potential risk related to data collection and use within our business will intensify in addition and foreign government have enacted or are considering enacting legislation or regulation or may in the near future interpret existing legislation or regulation in manner that could significantly impact our ability well the ability of our customer partner and data provider to collect augment analyze use transfer and share personal and other information that is integral to certain service we provide in the wake of the european union eu general data protection regulation gdpr the rate of global consideration and adoption of privacy law ha increased giving rise to more global jurisdiction in which regulatory inquiry and audit may be requested of oracle and if we are not deemed to be in compliance could result in enforcement action and or fine this is true in the where for example the california consumer privacy act ccpa became effective in january the congress is considering several privacy bill at the federal level and other state legislature are considering privacy law regulator globally are also imposing greater monetary fine for privacy violation the gdpr which became effective in may provides for monetary penalty of up to of an organization worldwide revenue these penalty can be significant for example one european data protection regulator ha fined major technology company million for it data handling practice the federal trade commission continues to fine company on regular basis for unfair and deceptive data protection practice and these fine may increase in size the ccpa provides for statutory damage or fine on per violation basis that could be very large in the event of significant data security breach or other ccpa violation taken together the change in law or regulation associated with the enhanced protection of personal and other type of data could greatly increase the size of potential fine related to data protection and our cost of providing our product and service could result in change to our business practice or even prevent from offering certain service in jurisdiction in which we operate although we have implemented contract diligence program policy and procedure designed to ensure compliance with applicable law and regulation there can be no assurance that our employee contractor partner supplier data provider or agent will not violate such law and regulation or our contract policy and procedure additionally public perception and standard related to the privacy of personal information can shift rapidly in way that may affect our reputation or influence regulator to enact regulation and law that may limit our ability to provide certain product and service we make statement about our use and disclosure of personal information through our privacy policy information provided on our website and press statement any failure or perceived failure by to comply with these public statement or with federal state or foreign law and regulation including law and regulation regulating privacy data security or consumer protection public perception standard self regulatory requirement or legal obligation could result in lost or restricted business proceeding action or fine brought against or levied by governmental entity or others or could adversely affect our business and harm our reputation table of content index to financial statement third party have claimed and in the future may claim infringement or misuse of intellectual property right and or breach of license agreement provision we periodically receive notice from or have lawsuit filed against by others claiming infringement or other misuse of their intellectual property right and or breach of our agreement with them these third party include entity that do not design manufacture or distribute product or service or that acquire intellectual property for the sole purpose of monetization through infringement assertion we expect to continue to receive such claim we continue to expand into new business and acquire company the number of product and competitor in our industry segment grows the use and support of third party code including open source code becomes more prevalent in the industry the volume of issued patent continues to increase and non practicing entity continue to assert intellectual property infringement in our industry segment responding to any such claim regardless of it validity could be time consuming costly and result in litigation divert management time and attention from developing our business require to pay monetary damage or enter into royalty and licensing agreement that we would not normally find acceptable require to stop selling or to redesign certain of our product require to release source code to third party possibly under open source license term require to satisfy indemnification obligation to our customer or otherwise adversely affect our business result of operation financial condition or cash flow we may not be able to protect our intellectual property right we rely on copyright trademark patent and trade secret law confidentiality procedure control and contractual commitment to protect our intellectual property despite our effort these protection may be limited unauthorized third party may try to copy or reverse engineer our product or otherwise use our intellectual property our patent may be invalidated or circumvented any of our pending or future patent application may not be issued with the claim scope we seek if at all in addition the law of some country do not provide the same level of intellectual property protection law and court if we can not protect our intellectual property against unauthorized copying or use or other misappropriation we may not remain competitive we may not receive significant revenue from our current research and development effort for several year if at all developing our various product offering is expensive and the investment in the development of these offering often involves long return on investment cycle an important element of our corporate strategy is to continue to dedicate significant amount of resource to research and development and related product and service opportunity both through internal investment and the acquisition of intellectual property from acquired company accelerated product and service introduction and short lifecycles require high level of expenditure for research and development that could adversely affect our operating result if not offset by revenue increase we believe that we must continue to dedicate significant amount of resource to our research and development effort to maintain our competitive position however we do not expect to receive significant revenue from these investment for several year if at all legal and regulatory risk adverse litigation result could affect our business we are subject to various legal proceeding litigation can be lengthy expensive and disruptive to our operation and can divert our management attention away from running our core business the result of our litigation also can not be predicted with certainty an adverse decision table of content index to financial statement could result in monetary damage or injunctive relief that could affect our business operating result or financial condition additional information regarding certain of the lawsuit we are involved in is discussed under note of note to consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report we may be subjected to increased tax due to change in or international tax law or from adverse resolution of tax audit and controversy multinational corporation we incur income tax well non income based tax such payroll sale use property and value added tax in both the and various foreign jurisdiction significant uncertainty exist with respect to the application of the various tax to the business in which we engage often requiring that we make judgment in determining our tax liability and worldwide provision for income tax we are regularly under audit by tax authority in the and internationally which can lead to disagreement such regarding our intercompany transfer price and calculation and on the applicability of withholding tax to our cross border transaction any unfavorable resolution of these tax audit and controversy could cause our tax liability to increase and may have significant adverse impact on our provision for income tax and tax rate although we believe that our income and non income based tax estimate are reasonable there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audit or dispute will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provision and tax accrual increasingly country around the world are actively considering or have enacted change in relevant tax accounting and other law regulation and interpretation in the various proposal if enacted would dramatically raise the corporate tax rate and increase the tax on non income such unfavorable tax legislation resulting from the shifting political landscape and economic environment create the potential for added volatility in our quarterly provision for income tax and could have significant adverse impact on our future income tax provision and tax rate other country also continue to consider change to their tax law that could negatively affect by increasing tax imposed on our international revenue stream operation and cross border transaction including the imposition of tax targeted at digital technology business and change in withholding tax regime more fundamentally longstanding international tax principle that determine each country right to tax cross border transaction are being reconsidered creating significant uncertainty to the future level of corporate income tax on our international operation this examination of the global tax system is driven by perceived need to provide greater taxing right to market jurisdiction where customer or user are located various measure are being discussed including adjustment to the manner in which taxable profit are allocated among jurisdiction well the limitation of deduction for or the imposition of additional withholding tax on intercompany payment the foregoing proposal to raise corporate income tax in combination with the uncertain international tax environment have upended the predictability and reliability of the global tax system our future income tax provision and tax rate could significantly increase if such tax law change are enacted in the or in country in which we do business our provision for income tax also could be adversely affected by shift of earnings from jurisdiction that have relatively lower statutory tax rate to those in which the rate are relatively higher in addition change in the valuation of our deferred tax asset or liability could negatively impact our income tax provision our international sale and operation subject to additional risk that can adversely affect our operating result we derive substantial portion of our revenue from and have significant operation outside of the compliance with international and law and regulation that apply to our international operation increase our cost of business in foreign jurisdiction these law and regulation include data privacy requirement labor relation law tax law foreign currency related regulation competition regulation anti bribery law and other law prohibiting payment to governmental official such the foreign corrupt practice act fcpa market access regulation tariff and import export and general trade regulation including but not limited to economic sanction and embargo violation of these law and regulation could result in fine and penalty criminal sanction against our officer or our employee and prohibition on the conduct of our business including the loss of trade privilege any such violation could result in prohibition on our ability to offer our product and service in one or more country could delay or prevent potential acquisition and could also table of content index to financial statement materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion effort our ability to attract and retain employee our business and our operating result these law can require suspension or termination of business including financial transaction in certain country territory or with certain customer and any such action in the future could adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation compliance with these law also requires significant amount of management attention and effort which may divert management attention from running our business operation and could harm our ability to grow our business or may increase our expense we engage specialized or other additional resource to assist with our compliance effort our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risk and manage these difficulty we monitor our operation and investigate allegation of impropriety relating to transaction and the way in which such transaction are recorded where circumstance warrant we provide information and report our finding to government authority and in some circumstance such authority conduct their own investigation and we respond to their request or demand for information no assurance can be given that action will not be taken by such authority or that our compliance program will prove effective we are also subject to variety of other risk and challenge in managing an organization operating globally including those related to general economic condition in each country or region public health risk social risk and supporting infrastructure stability risk particularly in area in which we have significant operation fluctuation in currency exchange rate and related impact on customer demand and our operating result difficulty in transferring fund from or converting currency in certain country that could lead to devaluation of our net asset in particular our cash asset in that country currency regulatory change including government austerity measure in certain country that we may not be able to sufficiently plan for or avoid that may unexpectedly impair bank deposit or other cash asset that we hold in these country or that impose additional tax that we may be required to pay in these country political unrest terrorism and the potential for other hostility common local business behavior that are in direct conflict with our business ethic practice and conduct policy natural disaster the effect of climate change such sea level rise drought flooding wildfire and increased storm sensitivity longer payment cycle and difficulty in collecting account receivable overlapping tax regime and reduced protection for intellectual property right in some country the variety of risk and challenge listed above could also disrupt or otherwise negatively impact our supply chain operation and sale of our product and service in affected country or region the majority shareholder of oracle financial service software limited publicly traded company in india and oracle corporation japan publicly traded company in japan we are faced with several additional risk including being subject to local security regulation and being unable to exert full control that we would otherwise have if these entity were wholly owned subsidiary our sale to government client expose to business volatility and risk including government budgeting cycle and appropriation procurement regulation governmental policy shift early termination of contract audit table of content index to financial statement investigation sanction and penalty we derive revenue from contract with the government state and local government and foreign government and are subject to procurement law relating to the award administration and performance of those contract governmental entity are variously pursuing policy that affect our ability to sell our product and service change in government procurement policy priority regulation technology initiative and or requirement may negatively impact our potential for growth in the government sector for example the government imposes evolving cybersecurity requirement including for example the fedramp authorization process and the department of defense dod cybersecurity maturity model certification cmmc these requirement may impact our line of business in the federal government market compliance with these cybersecurity requirement is complex and costly and failure to meet or delay in meeting the required security control could limit our ability to sell product and service directly or indirectly to the dod and other federal and state government entity that implement similar cybersecurity requirement we are also subject to early termination of our contract many governmental entity have the right to terminate contract at any time without cause for example the federal government may terminate any of our government contract and subcontract at it convenience or for default based on our performance federal state and local government and foreign government contract are generally subject to government funding authorization appropriation contract may be terminated based upon lack of government fund there is increased pressure on government and their agency both domestically and internationally to reduce spending government continue to face significant deficit reduction pressure this may adversely impact spending on government program government contract law and regulation impose certain risk and contract are generally subject to audit and investigation if violation of law are found they could result in civil and criminal penalty and administrative sanction including termination of contract refund of portion of fee received forfeiture of profit suspension of payment fine and suspension or debarment from future government business environmental and other related law and regulation subject to number of risk and could result in significant liability and cost some of our cloud and hardware operation are subject to state federal and international law governing protection of the environment proper handling and disposal of material used for these product human health and safety the use of certain chemical substance and the labor practice of supplier well local testing and labeling requirement compliance with these ever changing environmental and other law in timely manner could increase our product design development procurement manufacturing delivery cloud operation and administration cost limit our ability to manage excess and obsolete non compliant inventory change our sale activity or otherwise impact future financial result of our cloud and hardware business any violation of these law can subject to significant liability including fine penalty and possible prohibition of sale of our product and service into one or more state or country and result in material adverse effect on the financial condition or result of operation of our cloud and hardware business regulatory market and competitive pressure regarding the greenhouse gas emission and energy mix for our data center operation may also grow significant portion of our hardware revenue come from international sale environmental legislation such the eu directive on restriction of hazardous substance rohs the eu waste electrical and electronic equipment directive weee directive and china regulation on management method for controlling pollution caused by electronic information product among others may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our hardware revenue from the eu china and other country with similar environmental legislation we endeavor to comply with and implement these requirement the uk government ha announced procurement policy that includes environmental social and economic sustainability measure the sec requires public disclosure for registrant that use certain conflict mineral in their product our supply chain is multi tiered global and highly complex provider of hardware end product we are several step removed from the mining and smelting or refining of any conflict mineral in our supply chain accordingly our ability to determine with certainty the origin and chain of custody of conflict mineral is limited table of content index to financial statement we have an environmental steering committee esc comprised of senior individual from wide range of oracle business unit including our chief sustainability officer who report to our chief executive officer and oversees our overall sustainability strategy including climate related risk mitigation the esc evaluates if climate or environmental risk have the potential for significant chronic or acute impact on our core and or strategic business function including service delivery and support product development and deployment supply chain management facility operation employee recruitment and retention or brand reputation failure by the esc to identify and ass these risk could adversely affect our reputation business financial performance and growth we publish an annual corporate citizenship report which includes disclosure of our environmental social and governance esg matter and goal our disclosure on these matter and standard we set for ourselves or failure to meet these standard may potentially harm our reputation and brand by electing to set and share publicly these corporate esg standard our business may also face increased scrutiny related to esg activity financial risk our quarterly result of operation may fluctuate significantly based on number of factor that make our result of operation difficult for to predict our revenue particularly certain of our cloud license and on premise license revenue and hardware revenue can be difficult to forecast substantial portion of our cloud license on premise license and hardware contract is completed in the latter part of quarter and significant percentage of these is comprised of larger value order because significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the short term sale and revenue shortfall tend to have disproportionately negative impact on our profitability the number of large license transaction and to lesser extent hardware product transaction increase the risk of fluctuation in our quarterly result because delay in even small number of these transaction could cause our quarterly sale revenue and profitability to fall significantly short of our prediction in addition sudden shift in regional or global economic activity such what we experienced initially at the outset of the covid pandemic may cause our sale forecast to be inaccurate we may experience foreign currency gain and loss change in currency exchange rate can adversely affect customer demand and our revenue and profitability we conduct significant number of transaction and hold cash in currency other than the dollar change in the value of major foreign currency particularly the euro japanese yen and british pound relative to the dollar can significantly affect our total asset revenue operating result and cash flow which are reported in dollar fluctuation in foreign currency rate including the strengthening of the dollar against the euro and most other major international currency adversely affect our revenue growth in term of the amount that we report in dollar after converting our foreign currency result into dollar and in term of actual demand for our product and service certain of these product may become relatively more expensive for foreign currency based enterprise to purchase in addition currency variation can adversely affect margin on sale of our product in country outside of the generally our reported revenue and operating result are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currency and are positively affected when the dollar weakens in addition our reported asset generally are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currency portion of our consolidated cash and bank deposit among other asset are held in foreign currency and reported in dollar in addition we incur foreign currency transaction gain and loss primarily related to sublicense fee and other intercompany agreement among and our subsidiary that we expect to cash settle in the near term which are charged to earnings in the period incurred we have program which primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contract designed to offset the risk associated with certain foreign currency exposure we may suspend the program from time to time part of this program we enter into foreign currency forward contract so that increase or decrease in our foreign currency exposure are offset at least in part by gain or loss on the foreign currency forward contract in an effort to mitigate the risk and volatility associated with our foreign currency transaction gain or loss large portion of our consolidated operation are international and we expect that we will continue to realize gain or loss with respect to our foreign currency exposure net of gain or loss from our foreign currency forward contract for example we will experience foreign currency gain and loss in certain instance if it is not possible or cost effective to hedge our foreign currency exposure if our hedging effort are ineffective or should we suspend our foreign currency forward contract program our ultimate realized table of content index to financial statement loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuation will generally depend on the size and type of cross currency exposure that we enter into the currency exchange rate associated with these exposure and change in those rate whether we have entered into foreign currency forward contract to offset these exposure and any related fee paid to purchase such contract and other factor all of these factor could materially impact our result of operation financial position and cash flow we have incurred foreign currency loss associated with the devaluation of currency in certain highly inflationary economy relative to the dollar we could incur future loss in emerging market country where we do business should their currency become designated highly inflationary there are risk associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness of may we had an aggregate of billion of outstanding indebtedness that will mature between calendar year and calendar year and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operation generate sufficient cash flow to service such debt and the other factor discussed in this section there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risk successfully we may also need to refinance portion of our outstanding debt it matures there is risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the term of any refinancing may not be favorable the term of our existing debt furthermore if prevailing interest rate or other factor at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rate upon refinancing the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase should we incur future increase in interest expense our ability to utilize certain of our foreign tax credit to reduce our federal income tax could be limited which could unfavorably affect our provision for income tax and effective tax rate in addition change by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity security and increase the interest amount we pay on certain outstanding or future debt these risk could adversely affect our financial condition and result of operation risk related to our common stock our stock price could become more volatile and investment could lose value all of the factor discussed within this risk factor section could affect our stock price the timing of announcement in the public market by or by our competitor regarding new cloud service product product enhancement technological advance acquisition or major transaction could also affect our stock price change in the amount and frequency of share repurchase or dividend could affect our stock price our stock price could also be affected by factor some of which are beyond our control including among others speculation in the press social medium and the analyst community change in recommendation or earnings related estimate by financial analyst change in investor or analyst valuation measure for our stock negative analyst survey or channel check survey earnings announcement where our financial result differ from our guidance or investor expectation our credit rating and market trend unrelated to our performance the stock market in general and the market for technology company in particular ha experienced extreme price and volume fluctuation that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those company significant drop in our stock price could also expose to the risk of security class action lawsuit which could result in substantial cost and divert management attention and resource which could adversely affect our business we can not guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully implemented or that it will enhance long term stockholder value in fiscal our board of director approved expansion of our stock repurchase program totaling billion the repurchase program doe not have an expiration date and we are not obligated to repurchase specified number or dollar value of share our repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time and even if fully implemented may not enhance long term stockholder value table of content index to financial statement general risk economic political and market condition can adversely affect our business result of operation and financial condition including our revenue growth and profitability which in turn could adversely affect our stock price our business is influenced by range of factor that are beyond our control and that we have no comparative advantage in forecasting these include general economic and business condition overall demand for enterprise cloud license and hardware product and service governmental budgetary constraint or shift in government spending priority and general legal regulatory and political development macroeconomic development such the global economic effect resulting from the covid pandemic the united kingdom leaving the eu brexit evolving trade policy between the and international trade partner or the occurrence of similar event in other country that lead to uncertainty or instability in economic political or market condition could negatively affect our business operating result financial condition and outlook which in turn could adversely affect our stock price any general weakening of and related declining corporate confidence in the global economy or the curtailment of government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customer to reduce or eliminate their it budget and spending which could cause customer to delay decrease or cancel purchase of our product and service or cause customer not to pay or to delay paying for previously purchased product and service in addition international regional or domestic political unrest and the related potential impact on global stability terrorist attack and the potential for other hostility in various part of the world public health crisis such the covid pandemic and natural disaster continue to contribute to climate of economic and political uncertainty that could adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition including our revenue growth and profitability these factor generally have the strongest effect on our sale of cloud license and on premise license hardware and related service and to lesser extent also may affect our renewal rate for license support and our subscription based cloud offering business disruption could adversely affect our operating result significant portion of our critical business operation are concentrated in few geographic area some of which include emerging market international location that may be le stable relative to running

that are delivered worldwide through variety of flexible and interoperable it deployment model these model include on premise deployment cloud based deployment and hybrid deployment an approach that combine both on premise and cloud based deployment such our oracle cloud customer offering an instance of oracle cloud in customer own data center accordingly we offer choice and flexibility to our customer and facilitate the product service and deployment combination that best suit our customer need through our worldwide sale force and oracle partner network we sell to customer all over the world including business of many size government agency educational institution and resellers we have three business cloud and license hardware and service each of which comprises single operating segment the description set forth below part of this item and the information contained within item business and note of note to consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report provide additional information related to our business and operating segment and align to how our chief operating decision maker codms which include our chief executive officer and chief

impact of the covid pandemic on oracle business included in item business in this annual report the risk included in item risk factor in this annual report and the information presented below in result of operation in this item cloud and license business our cloud and license business which represented and of our total revenue in fiscal and respectively market sell and delivers broad spectrum of enterprise application and infrastructure technology through our cloud and license offering revenue stream included in our cloud and license business are cloud service and license support revenue which include license support revenue which are earned by providing oracle license support service to customer that have elected to purchase support service in connection with the purchase of oracle application and infrastructure software license for use in cloud on premise and other it environment substantially all license support customer renew their support contract with upon expiration in order to continue to benefit from technical support service and the periodic issuance of unspecified update and enhancement which current license support customer are entitled to receive license support contract are generally priced percentage of the net fee paid by the customer to purchase cloud license and or on premise license are generally billed in advance of the support service being performed are generally renewed at the customer option and are generally table of content index to financial statement recognized revenue ratably over the contractual period that the support service are provided which is generally one year and cloud service revenue which provide customer access to oracle cloud application and infrastructure technology via cloud based deployment model that oracle develops provides unspecified update and enhancement for deploys host manages and support and that customer access by entering into subscription agreement with for stated period oracle cloud service arrangement are generally billed in advance of the cloud service being performed generally have duration of one to three year are generally renewed at the customer option and are generally recognized revenue ratably over the contractual period of the cloud contract or in the case of usage model contract the cloud service are consumed over time cloud license and on premise license revenue which include revenue from the licensing of our software product including oracle application oracle database oracle middleware and java among others which our customer deploy within cloud based on premise and other it environment our cloud license and on premise license transaction are generally perpetual in nature and are generally recognized revenue up front at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use revenue from usage based royalty arrangement for distinct cloud license and on premise license are recognized at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs the timing of few large license transaction can substantially affect our quarterly license revenue due to the point in time nature of revenue recognition for license transaction which is different than the typical revenue recognition pattern for our cloud service and license support revenue in which revenue are generally recognized ratably over the contractual term cloud license and on premise license customer have the option to purchase and renew license support contract further described above providing choice and flexibility to our customer to when and how they deploy oracle application and infrastructure technology are important element of our corporate strategy in recent period customer demand for our application and infrastructure technology delivered through our oracle cloud service ha increased to address customer demand and enable customer choice we have introduced certain program for customer to pivot their application and infrastructure license and the related license support to the oracle cloud for new deployment and to migrate to and expand with the oracle cloud for their existing workload the proportion of our cloud service and license support revenue relative to our cloud license and on premise license revenue hardware revenue and service revenue ha increased and we expect this trend to continue cloud service and license support revenue represented and of our total revenue during fiscal and respectively our cloud and license business revenue growth is affected by many factor including the strength of general economic and business condition governmental budgetary constraint the strategy for and competitive position of our offering the continued renewal of our cloud service and license support customer contract by the customer contract base substantially all customer continuing to purchase license support contract in connection with their license purchase the pricing of license support contract sold in connection with the sale of license the pricing amount and volume of license and cloud service sold our ability to manage oracle cloud capacity requirement to meet existing and prospective customer demand and foreign currency rate fluctuation on constant currency basis we expect that our total cloud and license revenue generally will continue to increase due to expected growth in our cloud service and license support offering and continued demand for our cloud license and on premise license offering we believe these factor should contribute to future growth in our cloud and license business total revenue which should enable to continue to make investment in research and development and our cloud operation to develop improve increase the capacity of and expand the geographic footprint of our cloud and license product and service table of content index to financial statement our cloud and license business margin ha historically trended upward over the course of the four quarter within particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our cloud and license business revenue over those quarterly period and because the majority of our cost for this business are generally fixed in the short term the historical upward trend of our cloud and license business revenue over the course of the four quarter within particular fiscal year is primarily due to the addition of new cloud service and license support contract to the customer contract base that we generally recognize revenue ratably or based upon customer usage over the respective contractual term the renewal of existing customer cloud service and license support contract over the course of each fiscal year that we generally recognize revenue ratably and the historical upward trend of our cloud license and on premise license revenue which we generally recognize at point in time upon delivery in each case over those four quarterly period hardware business our hardware business which represented and of our total revenue in fiscal and respectively provides broad selection of enterprise hardware product and hardware related software product including oracle engineered system server storage industry specific hardware offering operating system virtualization management and other hardware related software and related hardware support each hardware product and it related software such an operating system or firmware are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for combined performance obligation the revenue for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product and it related software are delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer we expect to make investment in research and development to improve existing hardware product and service and to develop new hardware product and service the majority of our hardware product are sold through indirect channel including independent distributor and value added resellers our hardware support offering provide customer with unspecified software update for software component that are essential to the functionality of our hardware product and associated software product such oracle solaris our hardware support offering can also include product repair maintenance service and technical support service hardware support contract are entered into and renewed at the option of the customer are generally priced percentage of the net hardware product fee and are generally recognized revenue ratably the hardware support service are delivered over the contractual term we generally expect our hardware business to have lower operating margin percentage of revenue than our cloud and license business due to the incremental cost we incur to produce and distribute these product and to provide support service including direct material and labor cost our quarterly hardware revenue are difficult to predict our hardware revenue cost of hardware and hardware operating margin that we report are affected by many factor including our manufacturing partner ability to timely manufacture or deliver few large hardware transaction our strategy for and the position of our hardware product relative to competitor offering customer demand for competing offering including cloud infrastructure offering the strength of general economic and business condition governmental budgetary constraint whether customer decide to purchase hardware support contract at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale the percentage of our hardware support contract customer base that renews it support contract and the close association between hardware product which have finite life and customer demand for related hardware support hardware product age customer decision to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware infrastructure to newly developed technology that are available and foreign currency rate fluctuation service business our service business which represented of our total revenue in each of fiscal and help customer and partner maximize the performance of their investment in oracle application and infrastructure technology we believe that our service are differentiated based on our focus on oracle technology extensive experience broad set of intellectual property and best practice our service offering include consulting service and advanced customer service our service business ha lower margin than our cloud and license and hardware business our service revenue are affected by many factor including our strategy for and the table of content index to financial statement competitive position of our service customer demand for our cloud and license and hardware offering and the associated service for these offering general economic condition governmental budgetary constraint personnel reduction in our customer it department tighter control over customer discretionary spending and foreign currency rate fluctuation acquisition our selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy historically we have invested billion of dollar to acquire number of complementary company product service and technology the pace of our acquisition ha slowed in recent year but compelling opportunity become available we may acquire company product service and technology in furtherance of our corporate strategy note of note to consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report provides additional information related to our recent acquisition we believe that we can fund our future acquisition with our internally available cash cash equivalent and marketable security cash generated from operation additional borrowing or from the issuance of additional security we estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings operating margin cash flow and return on invested capital target before deciding to move forward with an acquisition critical accounting policy and estimate our consolidated financial statement are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle gaap set forth in the financial accounting standard board accounting standard codification asc and we consider the various staff accounting bulletin and other applicable guidance issued by the sec gaap set forth within the asc requires to make certain estimate judgment and assumption we believe that the estimate judgment and assumption upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to at the time that these estimate judgment and assumption are made these estimate judgment and assumption can affect the reported amount of asset and liability of the date of the financial statement well the reported amount of revenue and expense during the period presented to the extent that there are difference between these estimate judgment or assumption and actual result our financial statement will be affected the accounting policy that reflect our more significant estimate judgment and assumption and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial result include revenue recognition business combination goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessment accounting for income tax and legal and other contingency our senior management ha reviewed our critical accounting policy and related disclosure with the finance and audit committee of the board of director note of note to consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report includes additional information about our critical and other accounting policy revenue recognition the most critical judgment required in applying asc revenue recognition from customer and our revenue recognition policy relate to the determination of distinct performance obligation and the evaluation of the standalone selling price ssp for each performance obligation many of our customer contract include multiple performance obligation judgment is required in determining whether each performance obligation within customer contract is distinct oracle product and service generally do not require significant amount of integration or interdependency therefore multiple product and service table of content index to financial statement contained within customer contract are generally considered to be distinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purpose we allocate the transaction price for each customer contract to each performance obligation based on the relative ssp the determination of ssp is discussed below for each performance obligation within each contract we recognize the amount of transaction price allocated to each performance obligation within customer contract revenue each performance obligation is delivered we use historical sale transaction data and judgment among other factor in determining the ssp for product and service for substantially all performance obligation except cloud license and on premise license we are able to establish the ssp based on the observable price of product or service sold separately in comparable circumstance to similar customer we typically establish an ssp range for our product and service which is reassessed on periodic basis or when fact and circumstance change ssp for our product and service can evolve over time due to change in our pricing practice that are influenced by intense competition change in demand for our product and service and economic factor among others our cloud license and on premise license have not historically been sold on standalone basis substantially all customer elect to purchase license support contract at the time of license purchase license support contract are generally priced percentage of the net fee paid by the customer to purchase the license we are unable to establish the ssp for our cloud license and on premise license based on observable price given the same product are sold for broad range of amount that is the selling price is highly variable and representative ssp is not discernible from past transaction or other observable evidence result the ssp for cloud license and an on premise license included in contract with multiple performance obligation is generally determined by applying residual approach whereby all other performance obligation within contract are first allocated portion of the transaction price based upon their respective ssps with any residual amount of transaction price allocated to cloud license and on premise license revenue business combination we apply the provision of asc business combination asc in accounting for our acquisition asc requires that we evaluate whether transaction pertains to an acquisition of asset or to an acquisition of business business is defined an integrated set of asset and activity that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing return to investor asset acquisition are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual asset and liability assumed on relative fair value basis whereas the acquisition of business requires to recognize separately from goodwill the asset acquired and the liability assumed at the acquisition date fair value goodwill of the acquisition date is measured the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair value of the asset acquired and the liability assumed while we use our best estimate and assumption to accurately value asset acquired and liability assumed at the acquisition date well any contingent consideration where applicable our estimate are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date we record adjustment to the asset acquired and liability assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of business acquisition measurement period or final determination of the value of asset acquired or liability assumed whichever come first any subsequent adjustment are recorded to our consolidated statement of operation accounting for business combination requires our management to make significant estimate and assumption especially at the acquisition date including our estimate for intangible asset contractual obligation assumed pre acquisition contingency and any contingent consideration where applicable although we believe that the assumption and estimate we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired company and are inherently uncertain unanticipated event and circumstance may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumption estimate or actual result for given business acquisition we may identify certain pre acquisition contingency of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre acquisition contingency throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to ass whether we include these contingency part of the fair value estimate of asset acquired and liability assumed and if so to determine their estimated amount table of content index to financial statement if we can not reasonably determine the fair value of non income tax related pre acquisition contingency by the end of the measurement period which is generally the case given the nature of such matter we will recognize an asset or liability for such pre acquisition contingency if it is probable that an asset existed or liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated subsequent to the measurement period or final determination of the net asset value for the business combination whichever come first change in our estimate of such contingency will affect earnings and could have material effect on our result of operation and financial position in addition uncertain tax position and tax related valuation allowance assumed in business combination are initially estimated of the acquisition date we reevaluate these item quarterly based upon fact and circumstance that existed of the acquisition date with any adjustment to our preliminary estimate being recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance or contingency estimated value whichever come first change to these uncertain tax position and tax related valuation allowance will affect our provision for income tax in our consolidated statement of operation and could have material impact on our result of operation and financial position goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessment we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever event or change in circumstance indicate it carrying value may not be recoverable we make certain judgment and assumption to determine our reporting unit and in allocating shared asset and liability to determine the carrying value for each of our reporting unit judgment in the assessment of qualitative factor of impairment include cost factor financial performance legal regulatory contractual political business and other factor entity specific factor industry and market consideration macroeconomic condition and other relevant event and factor affecting the reporting unit to the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is le than it carrying value quantitative test is then performed performing quantitative goodwill impairment test includes the determination of the fair value of reporting unit and involves significant estimate and assumption these estimate and assumption include among others revenue growth rate and operating margin used to calculate projected future cash flow risk adjusted discount rate future economic and market condition and the determination of appropriate market comparables we make judgment about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible asset whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that impairment may exist in such situation we are required to evaluate whether the net book value of our finite lived intangible asset are recoverable we determine whether finite lived intangible asset are recoverable based upon the forecasted future cash flow that are expected to be generated by the lowest level associated asset grouping assumption and estimate about future value and remaining useful life of our intangible asset are complex and subjective and include among others forecasted undiscounted cash flow to be generated by certain asset grouping these assumption and estimate can be affected by variety of factor including external factor such industry and economic trend and internal factor such change in our business strategy and our internal forecast accounting for income tax judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision in the ordinary course of global business there are many transaction and calculation where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain some of these uncertainty arise consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangement among related entity the process of identifying item of revenue and expense that qualify for preferential tax treatment and the segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expense to avoid double taxation although we believe that our estimate are reasonable the final tax outcome of these matter could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provision and accrual such difference could have material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made table of content index to financial statement we record valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in order for to realize our deferred tax asset we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdiction where the deferred tax asset are located we consider future growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdiction in which we operate historical earnings taxable income in prior year if carryback is permitted under the law and prudent and feasible tax planning strategy in determining the need for valuation allowance in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset would be realized we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance an adjustment to our provision for income tax at such time we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimate and assumption that could differ from the actual result reflected in income tax return filed during the subsequent year adjustment based on filed return are generally recorded in the period when the tax return are filed and the global tax implication are known which can materially impact our effective tax rate the amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audit by federal state and foreign tax authority which often result in proposed assessment our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue may require certain judgment description of our accounting policy associated with tax related contingency assumed part of business combination is provided under business combination above for those tax related contingency that are not part of business combination we account for these uncertain tax issue pursuant to asc income tax which contains two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in tax return the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit including resolution of any related appeal or litigation process the second step is to measure the tax benefit the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax position no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matter we adjust reserve for our uncertain tax position due to changing fact and circumstance such the closing of tax audit judicial ruling and refinement of estimate or realization of earnings or deduction that differ from our estimate to the extent that the final outcome of these matter is different than the amount recorded such difference generally will impact our provision for income tax in the period in which such determination is made our provision for income tax include the impact of reserve provision and change to reserve that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalty legal and other contingency we are currently involved in various claim and legal proceeding quarterly we review the status of each significant matter and ass our potential financial exposure description of our accounting policy associated with contingency assumed part of business combination is provided under business combination above for legal and other contingency that are not part of business combination we accrue liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable because of uncertainty related to these matter accrual are based only on the best information available at the time the accrual are made additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claim and litigation and may revise our estimate such revision in the estimate of the potential liability could have material impact on our result of operation and financial position table of content index to financial statement result of operation presentation of operating segment

restricted stock based award and stock option our stock based compensation program is key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employee and align their interest with the interest of existing stockholder we recognize that restricted stock based award and stock option dilute existing stockholder and have sought to control the number of stock based award granted while providing competitive compensation package consistent with these dual goal our cumulative potential dilution since june ha been weighted average annualized rate of per year the potential dilution percentage is calculated the average annualized new restricted stock based award and stock option granted and assumed net of restricted stock based award and stock option forfeited by employee leaving the company divided by the weighted average outstanding share during the calculation period this maximum potential dilution will only result if all restricted stock based award vest and stock option are exercised of the outstanding stock option at may which generally have ten year exercise period all have exercise price lower than the market price of our common stock on such date in recent year our stock repurchase program ha more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock based compensation program however we may modify the level of our stock repurchase in the

in note and of note to consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report and liquidity and capital resource above the market value of our fixed rate marketable security investment are adversely impacted interest rate increase due in part to these factor we may realize loss if we sell security prior to their scheduled maturity that declined in market value due to change in interest rate however because we classify substantially all of our investment in debt security available for sale and record change in their fair value to aocl on our consolidated balance sheet no gain or loss are recognized in our earnings due to market change in interest rate unless such security are sold prior to their scheduled maturity or the decline in fair value are due to

billion of fixed rate borrowing and million of other borrowing compared to billion of may consisting of billion of fixed rate borrowing and million of other borrowing with the exception of those senior note for which we have table of content index to financial statement corresponding fair value hedge that are recorded at their fair value of each reporting period and discussed further below we record all of our fixed rate borrowing at amortized cost and therefore any change in interest rate do not impact the value that we report for these senior note or our consolidated financial statement of may we held certain interest rate and cross currency interest rate swap agreement that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest rate obligation associated with certain of our senior note to variable interest rate obligation based on libor that we have designated fair value hedge among certain other effect consequently these swap agreement are recorded at their fair value at each reporting period and incur gain and loss due to change in market interest rate but are substantially offset by the corresponding loss and gain on the related senior note for which the swap agreement pertained by entering into these swap arrangement we have assumed risk associated with variable interest rate based upon libor change in interest rate affected the interest expense that we recognized

foreign currency our principal currency exposure include the euro japanese yen saudi arabian riyal indian rupee and british pound our foreign currency exposure primarily arise from various intercompany transaction we have established program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contract to offset the risk that arise from the aforementioned transaction under this program our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contract for major currency in which we have an exposure so that increase or decrease in our foreign currency exposure are offset by gain or loss on the foreign currency forward contract which mitigate the risk and volatility associated with our foreign currency transaction we may suspend this program from time to time our foreign currency forward contract are generally short term in duration and we do not use them for trading purpose we realize gain or loss with respect to our foreign currency exposure net of gain or loss from our foreign currency forward contract and we also incur cost to enter into these foreign currency forward contract substantially all of which are included in non operating income net in our consolidated financial statement our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposure will generally depend on the size and type of cross currency transaction that we enter into the currency exchange rate associated with these exposure and change in those rate the net realized gain or loss on our foreign currency forward contract and other factor furthermore large portion of our consolidated

additionally control can be circumvented by the individual act of some person by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of control also is

customer to among others deploy architect integrate upgrade and secure their investment in oracle application and infrastructure technology our advanced customer service are designed to provide supplemental support service performance and higher availability for oracle product and service we apply the provision of asc revenue from contract with customer asc single standard for revenue recognition that applies to all of our cloud license hardware and service arrangement and generally require revenue to be recognized upon the transfer of control of promised good or service provided to our customer reflecting the amount of consideration we expect to receive for those good or service pursuant to asc revenue are recognized upon the application of the following step identification of the contract or contract with customer identification of the performance obligation in the contract determination of the transaction price allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligation in the contract and recognition of revenue when or the contractual performance obligation are satisfied our customer that contract with for the provision of cloud service software hardware or other service include business of many size government agency educational institution and our channel partner which include resellers and system integrator the timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to our customer we record an unbilled receivable which is included within account receivable on our consolidated balance sheet when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing we record deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet when revenue are to be recognized subsequent to cash collection for an invoice our standard payment term are generally net day but may vary invoice for cloud license and on premise license and hardware product are generally issued when the license is made available for customer use or upon delivery to the customer of the hardware product invoice for license support and hardware support contract are generally invoiced annually in advance cloud saas and iaa contract are generally invoiced annually quarterly or monthly in advance service are generally invoiced in advance or the service are performed most contract that contain financing component are contract financed through our oracle financing division the transaction price for contract that is financed through our oracle financing division is adjusted to reflect the time value of money and interest revenue is recorded component of non operating income net within our consolidated statement of operation based on market rate in the country in which the transaction is being financed our revenue arrangement generally include standard warranty or service level provision that our arrangement will perform and operate in all material respect defined in the respective agreement the financial impact of which have historically been and are expected to

which are subsequently remitted to governmental authority table of content index to financial statement oracle corporation note to consolidated financial statement continued may revenue recognition for cloud service revenue from cloud service provided on subscription basis are generally recognized ratably over the contractual period that the cloud service are delivered beginning on the date our service is made available to customer we recognize revenue ratably because the customer receives and consumes the benefit of the cloud service throughout the contract period revenue from cloud service that are provided on consumption basis such metered service are generally recognized based on the utilization of the service by the customer revenue recognition for license support and hardware support oracle primary performance obligation with respect to license support contract and hardware support contract are to provide customer with technical support needed and unspecified software product upgrade maintenance release and patch during the term of the support period if and when they are available and hardware product repair applicable oracle is obligated to make the license and

are generally recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use revenue from usage based royalty arrangement for distinct cloud license and on premise license are recognized at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs for usage based royalty arrangement with fixed minimum guarantee amount the minimum amount is generally recognized upfront when the software is made available to the royalty customer revenue recognition for hardware product the hardware product and related software such an operating system or

time that the hardware product is delivered and ownership is transferred to the customer revenue recognition for service service revenue are generally recognized over time the service are performed revenue for fixed price service are generally recognized over time applying input method to estimate progress to completion revenue for consumption based service are generally recognized the service are performed allocation of the transaction price for contract that have multiple performance obligation many of our contract include multiple performance obligation judgment is required in determining whether each performance obligation is distinct oracle product and service generally do not require significant amount of integration or interdependency therefore our product and service are generally not combined we allocate the transaction price for each contract to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price ssp for each performance obligation within each contract we use judgment in determining the ssp for product and service for substantially all performance obligation except cloud license and on premise license we are able to establish the ssp based on the observable price of product or service sold separately in comparable circumstance to similar customer we typically establish an ssp range for our product and service which is reassessed on periodic basis or when fact and circumstance change our cloud license and on premise license have not historically been sold on standalone basis the table of content index to financial statement oracle corporation note to consolidated financial statement continued may vast majority of all customer elect to purchase license support contract at the time of cloud license and on premise license purchase license support contract are generally priced percentage of the net fee paid by the customer to access the license we are unable to establish the ssp for our cloud license and on premise license based on observable price given the same product are sold for broad range of amount that is the selling price is highly variable and representative ssp is not discernible from past transaction or other observable evidence result the ssp for cloud license and an on premise license included in contract with multiple performance obligation is generally determined by applying residual approach whereby all other performance obligation within contract are first allocated portion of the transaction price based upon their respective ssps with any residual amount of transaction price allocated to cloud license and on premise license revenue remaining performance obligation from customer contract trade receivables net of allowance for doubtful account and deferred revenue are reported net of
