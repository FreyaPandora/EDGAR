business will be harmed our competitor product service and technology may be le costly or their product service and technology may offer superior functionality or different feature than ours in addition many of our competitor operate and maintain their own fabrication facility and have longer operating history greater name recognition larger customer base and greater financial sale marketing and distribution resource than we do these competitor may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunity in new market quickly transition their semiconductor product to increasingly smaller line width geometry and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging material which could harm our business if we fail to achieve design win for our product our business will be harmed for our product that we do not sell directly to consumer achieving design win is an integral part of our future success our oem odm and aib and motherboard manufacturer customer typically introduce new system configuration often twice per year typically based on spring and fall design cycle or in connection with trade show if oems odms and aib and motherboard manufacturer do not include our product in their system they will typically not use our product in their system at least the next design configuration in order to achieve design win we must anticipate the feature and functionality that customer and consumer will demand incorporate those feature and functionality into product that meet the exacting design requirement of our customer and price our product competitively in general we are limited in our ability to introduce new product and enhancement to our customer design cycle and we must maintain compliance with evolving industry standard unanticipated change in industry standard could render our product incompatible with product developed by major hardware manufacturer and software developer if our product are not in compliance with prevailing industry standard our customer may not incorporate our product into their design strategy of contentsif our intellectual property licensing strategy is not successful our licensing revenue may decline we intend to license our gpu core and visual computing patent portfolio to device manufacturer who offer product in market such mobile the extent of the demand to license our gpu core or other element of our visual computing patent portfolio is unknown and may be limited in addition we may not be able to renew our existing license agreement in january we entered into patent cross licensing agreement under which intel agreed to pay an aggregate of billion over six year the final million payment under this agreement is scheduled to be received in january and recognized revenue into the first quarter of fiscal year if we are unable to enter into new licensing agreement or renew our existing agreement and these agreement are not offset by other growth in income our financial result may be adversely affected if our product contain significant defect we could incur significant expense to remediate such defect our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market share our product are complex and may contain defect or experience failure or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issue in design fabrication packaging material and or use within system our

sell directly to customer the end product in which our device ha been integrated by oems odms aibs and tier automotive supplier and to the user of such end product any such defect may cause to incur significant warranty support and repair or replacement cost cause to lose market share and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development effort to find and correct the issue in addition an error or defect in new product or release or related software driver after commencement of commercial shipment could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design win and harm our relationship with customer also we may be required to reimburse customer including our customer cost to repair or replace product in the field product recall particularly an automotive recall or significant number of product return could be expensive could damage our reputation could result in the shifting of business to our competitor and could result in litigation such product liability suit if product liability claim is brought against the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the effort of our technical and management personnel and harm our business system security and data protection breach well cyber attack could disrupt our operation reduce our expected revenue and increase our expense which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation security breach computer malware and cyber attack have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent year these attack have occurred on our system in the past and may occur in the future experienced computer programmer hacker and employee may be able to penetrate our security control and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of our employee or third party these attack may create system disruption or cause shutdown these hacker may also develop and deploy virus worm and other malicious software program that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerability in our product for portion of our it infrastructure including business management and communication software product we rely on product and service provided by third party these provider may also experience breach and attack to their product which may impact our system data security breach may also result from non technical mean such action by an employee with access to our system actual or perceived breach of our security measure or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about our partner our customer or third party could expose our partner our customer third party or the individual affected to risk of loss or misuse of this information resulting in litigation and potential liability damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business our effort to prevent and overcome these challenge could increase our expense and may not be successful we may experience interruption delay cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customer such disruption could adversely impact our ability to fulfill order and interrupt other critical function delayed sale lower margin or lost customer result of these disruption could adversely affect our financial result stock price and reputation of contentswe depend on third party and their technology to manufacture assemble test and or package our product which reduces our control over product quantity and quality development enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business we do not manufacture the silicon wafer used for our gpus and tegra processor and do not own or operate wafer fabrication facility instead we are dependent on industry leading foundry such taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited and samsung electronics co ltd to manufacture our semiconductor wafer using their fabrication equipment and technique similarly we do not assemble test or package our product but instead rely on independent subcontractor such advanced semiconductor engineering inc byd auto co ltd hon hai precision industry co ltd jsi logistics ltd king yuan electronics co and siliconware precision industry co ltd we do not have long term commitment contract with these foundry or subcontractor result we face several significant risk which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand and or negatively impact our business operation gross margin revenue and or financial result including lack of guaranteed supply of wafer and other component and potential higher wafer and component price due to supply constraint failure by our foundry to procure raw material or to provide or allocate adequate manufacturing or test capacity for our product failure to develop obtain or successfully implement high quality leading edge process technology including transition to smaller geometry process technology needed to manufacture our product profitably or on timely basis loss of supplier and additional expense and or production delay result of qualifying new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of loss of or decision to add or change supplier lack of direct control over delivery schedule or product quantity and quality and delay in product shipment shortage decrease in product quality and or higher expense in the event our subcontractor or foundry prioritize our competitor order over our order or otherwise we also rely on third party software development tool to assist in the design simulation and verification of new product or product enhancement to bring new product and enhancement to market in timely manner we utilize sophisticated and technologically advanced software development tool to complete our design simulation and verification in the past we have experienced delay in the introduction of product and enhancement result of the inability of then available software development tool to fully simulate the complex feature and functionality of our product in the future the design requirement necessary to meet consumer demand for more feature and greater functionality from our product may exceed the capability of available software development tool if we miss design cycle or lose design win due to the unavailability of such software development tool we could lose market share and our revenue could decline if our product fail to achieve expected manufacturing yield our financial result could be adversely impacted and our reputation with our customer may be harmed manufacturing yield for our product are function of product design which is developed largely by and process technology which typically is proprietary to the foundry low yield may result from either product design or process technology failure we do not know whether yield problem will exist until our design is actually manufactured by the foundry when yield issue is identified the product is analyzed and tested to determine the cause result yield problem may not be identified until well into the manufacturing process and require and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem because of our potentially limited access to wafer foundry capacity any decrease in manufacturing yield could result in higher manufacturing cost and require to allocate our available product supply among our customer lower than expected yield could harm customer relationship our reputation and our financial result of contentsbusiness disruption could harm our business lead to decline in revenue and increase our cost our worldwide operation could be disrupted by earthquake telecommunication failure power or water shortage tsunami flood hurricane typhoon fire extreme weather condition medical epidemic or pandemic and other natural or man made disaster catastrophic event or climate change the occurrence of any of these business disruption could harm our business and result in significant loss decline in revenue and increase our cost and expense any of these business disruption could require substantial expenditure and recovery time in order to fully resume operation our corporate headquarters and portion of our research and development activity are located in california and other critical business operation and some of our supplier are located in asia near major earthquake fault known for seismic activity in addition majority of our principal it datacenters are located in california making our operation vulnerable to natural disaster or other business disruption occurring in this geographical area the manufacture of product component the final assembly of our product and other critical operation are concentrated in certain geographic location including taiwan china and korea our operation could be harmed if manufacturing logistics or other operation in these location are disrupted for any reason including natural disaster high heat event or water shortage information technology system failure military action or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issue the ultimate impact on our third party foundry and other supplier and our general infrastructure of located near major earthquake fault and being consolidated in certain geographical area is unknown in the event of major earthquake or other natural disaster or catastrophic event our revenue could decline and our business may be harmed we receive significant amount of our revenue from limited number of customer and our revenue could decline if we lose any of these customer we receive significant amount of our revenue from limited number of customer revenue from significant customer those representing or more of total revenue wa of our total revenue from one customer in fiscal year of our total revenue from two customer in fiscal year and of our total revenue from one customer in fiscal year the percentage of revenue we receive from our largest customer ha fluctuated significantly from period to period primarily due to the timing and number of design win with each customer well the continued diversification of our customer base we expand into new market and will likely continue to fluctuate in the future our operating result in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sale to relatively small number of customer well the ability of these customer to sell product that incorporate our gpus and tegra processor in the future these customer may decide not to purchase our product at all purchase fewer product than they in the past or alter their purchasing pattern in some other way particularly because substantially all of our sale are made on purchase order basis which permit our customer to cancel change or delay product purchase commitment with little or no notice to and without penalty our customer may develop their own solution our customer may purchase product from our competitor or our customer may discontinue sale or lose market share in the market for which they purchase our product the loss of any of our large customer or significant reduction in purchase by would likely harm our financial condition and result of operation and any difficulty in collecting account receivable could harm our operating result and financial condition we maintain an allowance for doubtful account for estimated loss resulting from the inability of certain of our customer to make required payment and obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customer in the future we may have to record additional provision or write offs and or defer revenue on certain sale transaction which could negatively impact our financial result and we may not be able to acquire credit insurance on the credit we extend to these customer or in amount that we deem sufficient our gross margin depends on number of factor and change in any of these factor could adversely affect our gross margin our gross margin for any period depends on number of factor including the mix of our product sold average selling price introduction of new product product transition sale discount pricing action by our competitor the cost of product component and the yield of wafer produced by the foundry that manufacture our product we are focused on improving our gross margin and if we are not able to control or estimate the impact of the factor or other factor we do not foresee our gross margin may be negatively impacted in addition gross margin for our tegra processor are lower than our overall corporate gross margin if tegra processor comprise higher percentage of our future revenue or if we continue to enter into new business area with comparatively lower margin our overall gross margin may decline of contentsif we fail to estimate customer demand properly our financial result could be harmed we manufacture our gpus and tegra processor based on estimate of customer demand in order to have shorter shipment lead time and quicker delivery schedule for our customer we may build inventory for anticipated period of growth which do not occur or may build inventory anticipating demand for customer product that doe not materialize in estimating demand we make multiple assumption any of which may prove to be incorrect situation that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include change in business and economic condition including downturn in our target market and or overall economy change in consumer confidence caused by change in market condition including change in the credit market sudden and significant decrease in demand for our product higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirement our introduction of new product resulting in lower demand for older product or increased competition including competitive pricing action in addition the cancellation or deferral of customer purchase order could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our gross margin in addition because we often sell substantial portion of our product in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitment in timely manner in response to customer cancellation or deferral we could be required to write our inventory to the lower of cost or market or write excess inventory and we could experience reduction in average selling price if we incorrectly forecast product demand any of which could harm our financial result conversely if we underestimate our customer demand for our product our foundry partner may not have adequate lead time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customer order on timely basis even if we are able to increase production level to meet customer demand we may not be able to do in cost effective or timely manner if we fail to fulfill our customer order on timely basis or at all our customer relationship could be damaged we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged we are subject to risk and uncertainty associated with international operation which may harm our business we conduct our business worldwide and we have office in various country outside of the united state our semiconductor wafer are manufactured assembled tested and packaged by third party located outside of the united state and other america we also generate significant portion of our revenue from sale to customer outside the united state and other america revenue from sale to customer outside of the united state and other america accounted for of total revenue for both fiscal year and and of total revenue for fiscal year the global nature of our business subject to number of risk and uncertainty including international economic and political condition such political tension country in which we do business unexpected change in or imposition of legislative or regulatory requirement differing legal standard with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practice local business and cultural factor that differ from our normal standard and practice including business practice that we are prohibited from engaging in by the foreign corrupt practice act and other anticorruption law and regulation exporting or importing issue related to export or import restriction tariff quota and other trade barrier and restriction financial risk such longer payment cycle difficulty in collecting account receivable and foreign exchange rate fluctuation and increased cost due to imposition of climate change regulation such carbon tax fuel or energy tax and pollution limit if sale to any of our customer outside of the united state and other america are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factor our revenue may be negatively impacted of contentswe may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefit of business acquisition or strategic investment and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition target which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new product or sell our product we have in the past and intend to continue to acquire and invest in other business that offer product service and technology that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing product and business any of the following risk associated with past or future acquisition or investment could impair our ability to grow our business develop new product or sell our product and ultimately could have negative impact on our growth or our financial result difficulty in combining the technology product operation or workforce of the acquired business with our business diversion of capital and other resource including management attention assumption of liability incurring amortization expense impairment charge to goodwill or write down of acquired asset potential failure of our due diligence process to identify significant issue with product quality architecture and development or legal and financial contingency among other thing and impairment of relationship with employee vendor and customer or the loss of any of our key employee vendor or customer or our target key employee vendor or customer result of our acquisition or investment risk related to regulatory legal our common stock and other mattersactions to adequately protect our intellectual property right such litigation to defend against alleged infringement of intellectual property right or to enforce our intellectual property right could result in substantial cost to and our ability to compete could be harmed if we fail to take such action or are unsuccessful in so we rely primarily on combination of patent trademark trade secret employee and third party nondisclosure agreement licensing arrangement and the law of the country in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the united state and internationally the law of certain foreign country may not protect our product or intellectual property right to the same extent the law of the united state this make the possibility of piracy of our technology and product more likely we continuously ass whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovation and technology but can not be certain whether our application for such protection will be approved and if approved whether we will be able to enforce such protection we have in the past and may in the future become involved in lawsuit or other legal proceeding alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property right violation by our employee or party that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claim of infringement an unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damage invalidation of patent or family of patent indemnification of customer payment of lost profit or when it ha been sought injunctive relief we may commence litigation or other legal proceeding in order to protect our intellectual property right such proceeding may increase our operating expense which could negatively impact our operating result further we could be subject to countersuit result of our initiation of litigation for example in september we filed complaint against qualcomm inc and various samsung entity with both the itc and the united state district court for the district of delaware for infringement of seven patent relating to graphic processing in november various samsung entity filed complaint against and velocity micro for alleged infringement of samsung patent if infringement claim are made against or our product are found to infringe third party patent or intellectual property we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek license to the third party patent or other intellectual property right however we may not be able to obtain license at all or on term acceptable to particularly from our competitor if we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain license from third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our product we could be subject to substantial liability or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our product we may also have to make royalty or other payment or cross license our technology if these arrangement are not concluded on commercially reasonable term our business could be negatively impacted furthermore the indemnification of customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expense which could negatively impact our operating result of contentsour operating result have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate and if our operating result are below the expectation of security analyst or investor our stock price could decline our operating result have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factor for example our operating expense represent significant portion of total revenue and are largely independent of revenue in any particular period in particular our research and development expense reflect multi year commitment to the development of new product and enhancement that will not result in revenue if any until future period therefore investor should not rely on quarterly comparison of our result of operation an indication of our future performance factor that could affect our result of operation in the future include demand and market acceptance for our product and or our customer product the successful development and volume production of our next generation product our inability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfall due to multi year development cycle for some of our product and service new product announcement or product introduction by our competitor our introduction of new product in accordance with oems design requirement and design cycle change in the timing of product order due to unexpected delay in the introduction of our customer product the level of growth or decline of the pc industry in general seasonal fluctuation associated with the pc and consumer product market contraction in automotive and consumer end market demand due to adverse regional or worldwide economic condition slower than expected growth of demand for new technology fluctuation in the availability of manufacturing capacity or manufacturing yield our ability to reduce the manufacturing cost of our product competitive pressure resulting in lower than expected average selling price product rate of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issue rescheduling or cancellation of customer order the loss of significant customer substantial disruption in the operation of our foundry or other third party subcontractor result of natural disaster equipment failure terrorism or other cause supply constraint for and change in the cost of the other component incorporated into our customer product including memory device cost associated with the repair and replacement of defective product unexpected inventory write down or write offs legal and other cost related to defending intellectual property and other type of lawsuit availability of software and technology license at commercially reasonable term for the continued sale or development of new product customer bad debt write offs change in our effective tax rate result of change in the mix of earnings in country with differing statutory tax rate applicable tax law or interpretation of tax law any unanticipated cost associated with environmental liability unexpected cost related to our ownership of real property cost to comply with new government regulation such the sec conflict mineral regulation and regulatory enforcement action cost to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting our inability to forecast change in financial accounting standard or interpretation of existing standard and general macroeconomic event and factor affecting the overall semiconductor industry any one or more of the factor discussed above could prevent from achieving our expected future financial result any such failure to meet our expectation or the expectation of our investor or security analyst could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility and result investor may suffer loss in the past security class action litigation ha often been brought against company following period of volatility in the market price of it security we have been in the past and may be in the future the target of security litigation such lawsuit generally result in the diversion of management time and attention away from business operation which could harm our business in addition the cost of defense and any damage resulting from litigation ruling against or settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial result of contentswe have substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligation in december we issued billion of convertible senior note due or note our substantial indebtedness may limit

our consolidated financial statement which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state or gaap the preparation of these financial statement requires to make estimate and judgment that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue cost of revenue expense and related disclosure of contingency on an on going basis we evaluate our estimate including those related to revenue recognition inventory income tax goodwill cash equivalent and marketable security stock based compensation and litigation investigation and settlement cost and other contingency we base our estimate on historical experience and on various other assumption that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstance the result of which form the basis for making judgment about the carrying value of asset and liability we believe the following critical accounting policy affect our significant judgment and estimate used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statement our management ha discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policy and estimate with the audit committee of our board of director the audit committee ha reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policy and estimate in this annual report on form revenue recognitionproduct revenuewe recognize revenue from product sale when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product ha been delivered the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured for sale to certain distributor with right of return for which the level of return can not be reasonably estimated our policy is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributor resell the product and in some case when customer return right lapse our customer program primarily involve rebate which are designed to serve sale incentive to resellers of our product in various target market we account for rebate reduction of revenue and accrue for of the potential rebate and do not apply breakage factor while we have long history of rebate arrangement with oems we believe we are unable to apply our historical experience to reliably estimate the amount of rebate that will eventually be claimed by individual oems in such case the oems may not be our direct customer and therefore the quantity and mix of demand they place on their cems odms may shift we introduce new generation and iteration of product and we experience change in new competitor offering in addition we typically find that approximately of the rebate we accrue each year are eventually claimed which is substantially close to and that this percentage varies by program and by customer we recognize liability for these rebate at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate rebate typically expire six month from the date of the original sale unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate unclaimed rebate are reversed to revenue the amount of which typically represents approximately of total revenue our customer program also include marketing development fund or mdfs mdfs represent monies paid to retailer system builder oems distributor add in card partner and other channel partner that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partner activity while also promoting nvidia product depending on market condition we may take action to increase amount offered under customer program possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such program are offered we account for mdfs reduction of revenue and apply breakage factor to certain type of mdf program accrual for which we believe we can make reasonable and reliable estimate of the amount that will ultimately be unclaimed we also record reduction to revenue by establishing sale return allowance for estimated product return at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rate however if product return for particular fiscal period exceed historical return rate we may determine that additional sale return allowance are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product return of contentslicense and development revenuefor license arrangement that require significant customization of our intellectual property component we generally recognize the related revenue over the period that service are performed for most license and service arrangement we determine progress to completion based on actual direct labor hour incurred to date percentage of the estimated total direct labor hour required to complete the project we periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimate to complete each contract remain accurate revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of project in progress significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hour any change in or deviation from these estimate could have material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period for license arrangement that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverable over the term of the license agreement we record revenue over the life of the license term with consideration received in advance of the performance period classified deferred revenue please refer to note of the

approximates actual cost on an average or first in first basis we charge cost of sale for inventory provision to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or estimated market value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory most of our inventory provision relate to the write off of excess quantity of product based on our inventory level and future product purchase commitment compared to assumption about future demand and market condition situation that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include change in business and economic condition change in consumer confidence caused by change in market condition sudden and significant decrease in demand for our product inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirement failure to estimate customer demand properly for older product newer product are introduced or unexpected competitive pricing action by our competition in addition cancellation or deferral of customer purchase order could result in our holding excess inventory also because we often sell substantial portion of our product in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitment in timely manner in response to customer cancellation or deferral charge to cost of sale for inventory provision totaled million million and million for fiscal year and unfavorably impacting our gross margin by and respectively sale of inventory that wa previously written off or written down totaled million million and million for fiscal year and favorably impacting our gross margin by and respectively result the overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provision and sale of item previously written down wa an unfavorable impact of and in fiscal year and respectively during fiscal year and the charge we took to cost of sale for inventory provision were primarily related to the write off of excess quantity of gpu and tegra processor product whose inventory level were higher than our updated forecast of future demand for those product fable semiconductor company we must make commitment to purchase inventory based on forecast of future customer demand in doing so we must account for our third party manufacturer lead time and constraint we also adjust to other market factor such product offering and pricing action by our competitor new product transition and macroeconomic condition all of which may impact demand for our product please refer to the gross profit and gross margin discussion below in this management discussion and analysis for further discussion income taxeswe recognize federal state and foreign current tax liability or asset based on our estimate of tax payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax asset or liability appropriate for our estimate of future tax effect attributable to temporary difference and carryforwards and we record valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax asset by the amount of any tax benefit that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized of contentsunited state income tax ha not been provided on portion of earnings of our non subsidiary to the extent that such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested our calculation of current and deferred tax asset and liability is based on certain estimate and judgment and involves dealing with uncertainty in the application of complex tax law our estimate of current and deferred tax asset and liability may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome change in accounting standard or tax law in the united state or foreign jurisdiction where we operate or change in other fact or circumstance in addition we recognize liability for potential united state and foreign income tax contingency based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax may be due if we determine that payment of these amount is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is le than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statement accordingly of january we had valuation allowance of million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax asset that management determined are not likely to be realized due in part to projection of future taxable income and potential utilization limitation of tax attribute acquired result of stock ownership change to the extent realization of the deferred tax asset becomes more likely than not we would recognize such deferred tax asset an income tax benefit during the period goodwillgoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if indicator of potential impairment exist using either qualitative or quantitative assessment our impairment review process compare the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to it carrying value we have identified two reporting unit gpu and tegra processor for the purpose of completing our goodwill analysis goodwill assigned to these reporting unit of january wa million and million respectively determining the number of reporting unit and the fair value of reporting unit requires to make judgment and involves the use of significant estimate and assumption we also make judgment and assumption in allocating asset and liability to each of our reporting unit we base our fair value estimate on assumption we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain during the fourth quarter of fiscal year we elected to use the quantitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit in applying the fair value based test of each reporting unit the result from the income approach and the market approach were equally weighted these valuation approach consider number of factor that include but are not limited to prospective financial information growth rate terminal or residual value discount rate and comparable multiple from publicly traded company in our industry and require to make certain assumption and estimate regarding industry economic factor and the future profitability of our business when performing an income approach valuation we incorporate the use of projected financial information and discount rate that are developed using market participant based assumption to our discounted cash flow model our estimate of discounted cash flow were based upon among other thing certain assumption about our expected future operating performance such revenue growth rate operating margin risk adjusted discount rate and future economic and market condition our estimate may differ from actual cash flow due to among other thing economic condition change to our business model or change in operating performance additionally certain estimate of discounted cash flow involve business with limited financial history and developing revenue model which increase the risk of difference between the projected and actual performance the long term financial forecast that we utilize represent the best estimate that we have at this time and we believe that it underlying assumption are reasonable significant difference between our estimate and actual cash flow could materially affect our future financial result which could impact our future estimate of the fair value of our reporting unit during the fourth quarter of fiscal year we concluded that there wa no impairment of our goodwill the fair value of our gpu reporting unit significantly exceeded it carrying value and the fair value of our tegra processor reporting unit exceeded it carrying value by such even if we applied hypothetical decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit it still would not have resulted in the fair value of our reporting unit being le than their carrying value an overall test of the reasonableness of estimated fair value of our reporting unit we reconciled the combined fair value estimate of our reporting unit to our market capitalization of the valuation date the reconciliation confirmed that the fair value were relatively representative of the market view when applying reasonable control premium to the market capitalization however any significant reduction in the actual amount of future cash flow realized by our reporting unit reduction in the value of market comparables or reduction in our market capitalization could impact future estimate of the fair value of our reporting unit such event could ultimately result in charge to our earnings in future period due to the potential for write down of the goodwill associated with our reporting unit of contentsin particular the fair value of our tegra reporting unit exceeded it carrying value by approximately the fair value of this reporting unit wa assessed using combination of income and market approach the underlying assumption we used in assessing the fair value of the tegra reporting unit include but are not limited to assumption around future revenue growth rate gross margin operating expense investment level overall market growth rate our market share of the overall market and the appropriate discount rate to apply to future cash flow if the actual future result of the tegra reporting unit do not achieve the level we estimated in assessing it fair value the fair value of the tegra reporting unit could decline future decline in the fair value of the tegra reporting unit could result charge to our earnings result of write down of the value of the goodwill associated with that reporting unit our next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year or earlier if indicator of potential impairment exist such indicator include but are not limited to challenging economic condition such decline in our operating result an unfavorable industry or macroeconomic environment substantial decline in our stock price or any other adverse change in market condition such condition could have the effect of changing one of the critical assumption or estimate we use to calculate the fair value of our reporting unit which could result in decrease in fair value and require to record goodwill impairment charge cash equivalent and marketable securitiescash equivalent consist of financial instrument which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturity of three month or le at the time of acquisition marketable security consist primarily of highly liquid investment with maturity of greater than three month when purchased we measure our cash equivalent and marketable security at fair value the fair value of our financial asset and liability are determined using quoted market price of identical asset or quoted market price of similar asset from active market our level asset consist of our money market fund we classify security within level asset when the fair value is obtained from real time quote for transaction in active exchange market involving identical asset our available for sale security are classified level input our level asset are valued utilizing market approach where the market price of similar asset are provided by variety of independent industry standard data provider to our investment custodian most of our cash equivalent and marketable security are valued based on level input we did not have any investment classified level of january all of our available for sale investment are subject to periodic impairment review we record charge to earnings when decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be other than temporary or have other indicator of impairment if the fair value of an available for sale debt instrument is le than it amortized cost basis an other than temporary impairment is triggered in circumstance where we intend to sell the instrument it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of it amortized cost basis or credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument in these situation we recognize an other than temporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instrument amortized cost basis and it fair value for available for sale debt instrument that are considered other than temporarily impaired due to the existence of credit loss if we do not intend to sell and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the instrument before recovery of it remaining amortized cost basis amortized cost basis le any current period credit loss we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other factor the credit loss component is recognized in earnings we performed an impairment review of our investment portfolio of january we concluded that our investment were appropriately valued and that no other than temporary impairment charge were necessary on our portfolio of available for sale investment of january stock based compensationour stock based compensation expense is associated with stock option restricted stock unit or rsus performance stock unit or psus and our employee stock purchase plan or espp during fiscal year we shifted away from granting stock option and toward granting rsus and psus to reflect changing market trend for equity incentive at our peer company the number of psus that will ultimately vest is contingent on the company level of achievement compared with the corporate financial performance target established by our compensation committee in the beginning of each fiscal year the number of share of our stock to be received at vesting range from to of the target amount of contentswe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant minus dividend yield discount the fair value of award of rsus and psus the compensation expense for rsus is recognized using straight line attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for psus is recognized using an accelerated amortization model we estimate the fair value of share to be issued under our espp using the black scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in march and september of each year stock based compensation for our espp is expensed using an accelerated amortization model our rsu and psu award are not eligible for cash dividend prior to vesting therefore the fair value of rsus and psus is discounted by the dividend yield additionally we estimate forfeiture annually based on historical experience and revise the estimate of forfeiture in subsequent period if actual forfeiture differ from those estimate if factor change the compensation expense that we record under these accounting standard may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period litigation investigation and settlement costsfrom time to time we are involved in legal action and or investigation by regulatory body we are aggressively defending our current litigation matter however there are many uncertainty associated with any litigation or investigation and we can not be certain that these action or other third party claim against will be resolved without costly litigation fine and or substantial settlement payment if that occurs our business financial condition and result of operation could be materially and adversely affected if information becomes available that cause to determine that loss in any of our pending litigation investigation or settlement is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such event we will record the loss in accordance with gaap however the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimate which could require to record additional cost result of operation the following table set forth for the period indicated certain item in our

statement continued revenue recognition product revenuewe recognize revenue from product sale when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product ha been delivered the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured for most sale we use binding purchase order and in certain case we use contractual agreement evidence of an arrangement we consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer at the point of sale we ass whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured if we determine that collection of fee is not reasonably assured we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured which is generally upon receipt of payment for sale to certain distributor with right of return for which the level of return can not be reasonably estimated our policy is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributor resell the product and in some case when customer return right lapse our customer program primarily involve rebate which are designed to serve sale incentive to resellers of our product in various target market we account for rebate reduction of revenue and recognize liability for these rebate at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate unclaimed rebate are reversed to revenue our customer program also include marketing development fund or mdfs mdfs represent monies paid to retailer system builder original equipment manufacturer or oems distributor add in card partner and other channel partner that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partner activity while also promoting nvidia product we account for mdfs reduction of revenue and apply breakage factor to certain type of mdf program we also record reduction to revenue by establishing sale return allowance for estimated product return at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rate however if product return for particular fiscal period exceed historical return rate we may determine that additional sale return allowance are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product return license and development revenuefor license arrangement that require significant customization of our intellectual property component we generally recognize the related revenue over the period that service are performed for most license and service arrangement we determine progress to completion based on actual direct labor hour incurred to date percentage of the estimated total direct labor hour required to complete the project provision for estimated loss on contract is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated cost incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded deferred cost on uncompleted contract if the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized the excess amount is recorded deferred revenue for license arrangement that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverable over the term of the license agreement we record revenue over the life of the license term with consideration received in advance of the performance period classified deferred revenue royalty revenue is recognized related to the distribution or sale of product that use our technology under

limited circumstance we may offer an extended limited warranty to customer for certain product we also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issue if loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated stock based compensation we estimate the fair value of employee stock option on the date of grant using binomial model and recognize the expense using straight line attribution method over

that occurs our business financial condition and result of operation could be materially and adversely affected if information becomes available that cause to determine that loss in any of our pending litigation investigation or settlement is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such event we will record the loss in accordance with gaap however the actual liability in
