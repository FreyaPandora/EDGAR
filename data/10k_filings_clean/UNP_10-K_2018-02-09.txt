commodity can vary considerably each year depending upon various factor including the strength of domestic and international economy and currency and the strength of harvest and market price for agricultural product working capital at december we working capital surplus we maintain adequate resource and necessary have adequate access to capital market to meet any foreseeable cash requirement in addition to sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liability at december we had working capital deficit due primarily to decrease in other current asset related to tax receivable for the late extension of bonus depreciation at december along with an increase at december in account payable and upcoming debt maturity competition we are subject to competition from other railroad motor carrier ship and barge operator and pipeline our main railroad competitor is burlington northern santa fe llc it primary subsidiary bnsf railway company bnsf operates parallel route in many of our main traffic corridor in addition we operate in corridor served by other railroad and motor carrier motor carrier competition exists for five of our six commodity group excluding most coal shipment of the proximity of our route to major inland and gulf coast waterway barge can be particularly competitive especially for grain and bulk commodity in certain area where we operate in addition to price competition we face competition with respect to transit time quality and reliability of service from motor carrier and other railroad motor carrier in particular can have an advantage over railroad with respect to transit time and timeliness of service however railroad are much more fuel efficient than truck which reduces the impact of transporting good on the environment and public infrastructure and we have been making effort to convert certain truck traffic to rail additionally we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system truck and barge are able to use public right of way maintained by public entity any of the following could also affect the competitiveness of our transportation service for some or all of our commodity improvement or expenditure materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of these alternative mode of transportation ii legislation that eliminates or significantly increase the size or weight limitation applied to motor carrier or iii legislation or regulatory change that impose operating restriction on railroad or that adversely affect the profitability of some or all railroad traffic finally many movement face product or geographic competition where our customer can use different product natural gas instead of coal sorghum instead of corn or commodity from different location grain from state or country that we do not serve crude oil from different region sourcing different commodity or different location allows shipper to substitute different carrier and such competition may reduce our volume or constrain price for more information regarding risk we face from competition see the risk factor in item of this report key supplier we depend on two key domestic supplier of high horsepower locomotive both supplier provide part for locomotive and one also provides maintenance under service agreement due to the capital intensive nature of the locomotive manufacturing business and sophistication of this equipment potential new supplier face high barrier of entry into this industry therefore if one of these domestic supplier discontinues manufacturing locomotive supplying part or providing maintenance for any reason including insolvency or bankruptcy we could experience significant cost increase and risk reduced availability of the locomotive that are necessary to our operation additionally for high percentage of our rail purchase we utilize two steel producer one domestic and one international that meet our specification rail is critical for maintenance replacement improvement and expansion of our network and facility rail manufacturing also ha high barrier of entry and if one of supplier discontinues operation for any reason including insolvency or

also serf an emergency source of liquidity the company currently not intend to make any borrowing under this facility at december we had working capital surplus at december we had working capital deficit the decrease at year end wa primarily due to decrease in other current asset related to tax receivable for the late extension of bonus depreciation at december along with an increase at

began the current round of negotiation with the union existing agreement remain in effect until new agreement are ratified or the railway labor act rla procedure which include mediation potential arbitration cooling off period and the possibility of presidential emergency board and congressional intervention are exhausted through industry and local negotiation uprr reached tentative new agreement with of our major rail union nine union representing nearly of our agreement work force have ratified those agreement by significant margin the tentative agreement failed ratification with two union in early february representing about of our agreement work force returning any further discussion with them to the jurisdiction of the national mediation board another small union le than is still out for ratification uprr and the industry currently continue in active mediation with the remaining coalition of two union representing about of our agreement work force under the railway labor act the national mediation board control timing and location of mediation conference and when to terminate mediation moving the party to the next stage of the rla process contract negotiation historically continue for an extended period of time and we rarely experience work stoppage while negotiation are pending inflation long period of inflation significantly increase asset replacement cost for capital intensive company result assuming that we replace all operating asset at current price level depreciation charge on an inflation adjusted basis would be substantially greater than historically reported amount sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical change in interest rate could have on our result of operation and financial condition these hypothetical change do not consider other factor that could impact actual result at december we had variable rate debt representing approximately of our total debt if variable interest rate average one percentage point higher in than our december variable rate which wa approximately our interest expense would increase by approximately million this amount wa determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate on the balance of our variable rate debt at december market risk for fixed rate debt is estimated the potential increase in fair value resulting from hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rate of december and amount to an increase of approximately billion to the fair value of our debt at december we estimated the fair value of our fixed rate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate on quoted market price and current borrowing rate accounting pronouncement see note to the consolidated financial statement asserted and unasserted claim various claim and lawsuit are pending against and certain of our subsidiary we can not fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claim on our consolidated result of operation financial condition or liquidity to the extent possible we have recorded liability where asserted and unasserted claim are considered probable and where such claim can be reasonably estimated we do not expect that any known lawsuit claim environmental cost commitment contingent liability or guarantee will have material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation financial condition or liquidity after taking into account liability and insurance recovery previously recorded for these matter indemnity our maximum potential exposure under indemnification arrangement including certain tax indemnification can range from specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount depending on the nature of the transaction and the agreement due to uncertainty to whether claim will be made or they will be resolved we can not reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangement we do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payment under these indemnity provision climate change although climate change could have an adverse impact on our operation and financial performance in the future see risk factor under item of this report we are currently unable to predict the manner or severity of such impact however we continue to take step and explore opportunity to reduce the impact of our operation on the environment including investment in new technology using training program to reduce fuel consumption and changing our operation to increase fuel efficiency critical accounting policy our consolidated financial statement have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statement requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amount of revenue expense asset and liability we base our estimate on historical experience and on various other assumption that we believe are reasonable under the circumstance the result of which form the basis for making judgment about the carrying value of asset and liability that are not readily apparent from other source the following critical accounting policy are subset of our significant accounting policy described in note to the financial statement and supplementary data item these critical accounting policy affect significant area of our financial statement and involve judgment and estimate if these estimate differ significantly from actual result the impact on our consolidated financial statement may be material personal injury the cost of personal injury to employee and others related to our activity is charged to expense based on estimate of the ultimate cost and number of incident each year we use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability including unasserted claim the federal employer liability act fela governs compensation for work related accident under fela damage are assessed based on finding of fault through litigation or out of court settlement we offer comprehensive variety of service and rehabilitation program for employee are injured at work our personal injury liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payment approximately of the recorded liability is related to asserted claim and approximately is related to unasserted claim at december because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claim it is reasonably possible that future cost to settle these claim may range from approximately million to million we record an accrual at the low end of the range no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other estimate can vary over time due to evolving trend in litigation our personal injury liability activity wa follows million beginning balance current year accrual change in estimate for prior year payment ending balance at december current portion ending balance at december our personal injury claim activity wa follows open claim beginning balance new claim settled or dismissed claim open claim ending balance at december in conjunction with the liability update performed in we also reassessed our estimated insurance recovery we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recovery at december and any change to recorded insurance recovery are included in the above table in the change in estimate for prior year category asbestos we are defendant in number of lawsuit in which current and former employee and other party allege exposure to asbestos we ass our potential liability using statistical analysis of resolution cost for asbestos related claim this liability is updated annually and excludes future defense and processing cost the liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claim wa based on the following assumption the ratio of future claim by alleged disease would be consistent with historical average adjusted for inflation the number of claim filed against will decline each year the average settlement value for asserted and unasserted claim will be equivalent to historical average the percentage of claim dismissed in the future will be equivalent to historical average our liability for asbestos related claim is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payment approximately of the recorded liability related to asserted claim and approximately related to unasserted claim at december because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of asbestos related claim it is reasonably possible that future cost to settle these claim may range from approximately million to million we record an accrual at the low end of the range no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other our asbestos related liability activity wa follows million beginning balance accrual credit payment ending balance at december current portion ending balance at december our asbestos related claim activity wa follows open claim beginning balance new claim settled or dismissed claim open claim ending balance at december in conjunction with the liability update performed in we also reassessed our estimated insurance recovery we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recovery at december and the amount recorded for asbestos related liability and related insurance recovery were based on currently known fact however future event such the number of new claim filed each year average settlement cost and insurance coverage issue could cause the actual cost and insurance recovery to be higher or lower than the projected amount estimate also may vary in the future if strategy activity and outcome of asbestos litigation materially change federal and state law governing asbestos litigation increase or decrease the probability or amount of compensation of claimant and there are material change with respect to payment made to claimant by other defendant environmental cost we are subject to federal state and local environmental law and regulation we have identified site at which we are or may be liable for remediation cost associated with alleged contamination or for violation of environmental requirement this includes site that are the subject of action taken by the government of which are currently on the superfund national priority list certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified site consequently our ultimate environmental liability may include cost relating to activity of other party in addition to cost relating to our own activity at each site when we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned leased or otherwise used in our business we perform with assistance of our consultant environmental assessment on the property we expense the cost of the assessment incurred we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such cost can be reasonably estimated our environmental liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payment our environmental liability activity wa follows million beginning balance accrual payment ending balance at december current portion ending balance at december our environmental site activity wa follows open site beginning balance new site closed site open site ending balance at december the environmental liability includes future cost for remediation and restoration of site well ongoing monitoring cost but excludes any anticipated recovery from third party cost estimate are based on information available for each site financial viability of other potentially responsible party and existing technology law and regulation the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible party site specific cost sharing arrangement with other potentially responsible party the degree of contamination by various waste the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the site and the speculative nature of remediation cost estimate of liability may vary over time due to change in federal state and local law governing environmental remediation current obligation are not expected to have material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation financial condition or liquidity property and depreciation our railroad operation are highly capital intensive and our large base of homogeneous network type asset turn over on continuous basis each year we develop capital program for the replacement of asset and for the acquisition or construction of asset that enable to enhance our operation or provide new service offering to customer asset purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum unit of property criterion property and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on straight line basis over their estimated service life which are measured in year except for rail in high density traffic corridor all rail line except for those subject to abandonment yard and switching track and electronic yard for which life are measured in million of gross ton per mile of track we use the group method of depreciation in which all item with similar characteristic use and expected life are grouped together in asset class and are depreciated using composite depreciation rate the group method of depreciation treat each asset class pool of resource not singular item we currently have more than depreciable asset class and we may increase or decrease the number of asset class due to change in technology asset strategy or other factor we determine the estimated service life of depreciable railroad property by mean of depreciation study we perform depreciation study at least every three year for equipment and every six year for track asset rail and other track material tie and ballast and other road property our depreciation study take into account the following factor statistical analysis of historical pattern of use and retirement of each of our asset class evaluation of any expected change in current operation and the outlook for continued use of the asset evaluation of technological advance and change to maintenance practice and expected salvage to be received upon retirement for rail in high density traffic corridor we measure estimated service life in million of gross ton per mile of track it ha been our experience that the life of rail in high density traffic corridor are closely correlated to usage the amount of weight carried over the rail the service life also vary based on rail weight rail condition new or secondhand and rail type straight or curve our depreciation study for rail in high density traffic corridor consider each of these factor in determining the estimated service life for rail in high density traffic corridor we calculate depreciation rate annually by dividing the number of gross ton mile carried over the rail the weight of loaded and empty freight car locomotive and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail by the estimated service life of the rail measured in million of gross ton per mile rail in high density traffic corridor account for approximately percent of the historical cost of rail and other track material based on the number of gross ton mile carried over our rail in high density traffic corridor during the estimated service life of the majority of this rail ranged from approximately year to approximately year for all other depreciable asset we compute depreciation based on the estimated service life of our asset determined from the analysis of our depreciation study change in the estimated service life of our asset and their related depreciation rate are implemented prospectively estimated service life of depreciable railroad property may vary over time due to change in physical use technology asset strategy and other factor that will have an impact on the retirement profile of our asset we are not aware of any specific factor that are reasonably likely to significantly change the estimated service life of our asset actual use and retirement of our asset may vary from our current estimate which would impact the amount of depreciation expense recognized in future period change in estimated useful life of our asset due to the result of our depreciation study could significantly impact future period depreciation expense and have material impact on our consolidated financial statement if the estimated useful life of all depreciable asset were increased by one year annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately million if the estimated useful life of all depreciable asset were decreased by one year annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately million our recent depreciation study have resulted in lower depreciation rate for some asset class these lower rate will partially offset the impact of projected higher depreciable asset base resulting in an increase in total depreciation expense by approximately in versus under group depreciation the historical cost net of salvage of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized the historical cost of certain track asset is estimated by multiplying the current replacement cost of track asset by historical index factor derived from inflation index published by the bureau of labor statistic and ii the estimated useful life of the asset determined by our depreciation study the index were selected because they closely correlate with the major cost of the property comprising the applicable track asset class because of the number of estimate inherent in the depreciation and retirement process and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variable until group of property is completely retired we continually monitor the estimated service life of our asset and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rate are appropriate in addition we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by our depreciation study any deficiency or excess is amortized component of depreciation expense over the remaining service life of the applicable class of asset for retirement of depreciable railroad property that do not occur in the normal course of business gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meet each of the following three condition it is unusual ii it is material in amount and iii it varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation study during the last three fiscal year no gain or loss were recognized due to the retirement of depreciable railroad property gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of asset that are not part of our railroad operation income tax we account for income tax by recording tax payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax asset and liability for the expected future tax consequence of event that have been recognized in our financial statement or tax return these expected future tax consequence are measured based on current tax law the effect of future tax legislation are not anticipated future tax legislation such change in the corporate tax rate could have material impact on our financial condition result of operation or liquidity for example permanent increase in future income tax rate would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately million similarly permanent decrease in future income tax rate would decrease our deferred tax liability by approximately million when appropriate we record valuation allowance against deferred tax asset to reflect that these tax asset may not be realized in determining whether valuation allowance is appropriate we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax asset will not be realized based on management judgment using available evidence for purpose of estimating whether future taxable income will be sufficient to realize deferred tax asset in and there were no valuation allowance we recognize tax benefit that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authority the amount recognized is measured the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely to be realized upon settlement liability for unrecognized tax benefit is recorded for any tax benefit claimed in our tax return that do not meet these recognition and measurement standard pension and other postretirement benefit we use an actuarial analysis to measure the liability and expense associated with providing pension and medical and life insurance benefit opeb to eligible employee in order to use actuarial method to value the liability and expense we must make several assumption the critical assumption used to measure pension obligation and expense are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension asset for opeb the critical assumption are the discount rate and health care cost trend rate we evaluate our critical assumption at least annually and selected assumption are based on the following factor beginning in we measure the service cost and interest cost component of our net periodic benefit cost by using individual spot rate matched with separate cash flow for each future year discount rate are based on mercer yield curve of high quality corporate bond rated aa by recognized rating agency expected return on plan asset is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return taking into consideration current and expected market condition health care cost trend rate is based on our historical rate of inflation and expected market condition the following table present the key assumption used to measure net periodic pension and opeb cost benefit for and the estimated impact on net periodic pension and opeb cost benefit relative to change in those assumption assumption pension opeb discount rate for benefit obligation discount rate for interest on benefit obligation discount rate for service cost discount rate for interest on service cost expected return on plan asset compensation increase health care cost trend rate pre current pre level in sensitivity increase in expense million pension opeb decrease in discount rate increase in compensation scale decrease in expected return on plan asset increase in health care cost trend rate the

depreciated on straight line basis over their estimated service life which are measured in year except for rail in high density traffic corridor all rail line except for those subject to abandonment yard and switching track and electronic yard for which life are measured in million of gross ton per mile of track we use the group method of depreciation in which all item with similar characteristic use and expected life are grouped together in asset class and are depreciated using composite depreciation rate the group method of depreciation treat each asset class pool of resource not singular item we determine the estimated service life of depreciable railroad asset by mean of depreciation study under the group method of depreciation no gain or loss is recognized when depreciable property is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business impairment of long lived asset we review long lived asset including identifiable intangible for impairment when event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if impairment indicator are present and the estimated future undiscounted cash flow are le than the carrying value of the long lived asset the carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value measured by the discounted cash flow revenue recognition we recognize freight revenue freight move from origin to destination the allocation of revenue between reporting period is based on the relative transit time in each reporting period with expense recognized incurred other revenue which include revenue earned by our subsidiary revenue from our commuter rail operation and accessorial revenue are recognized service is performed or contractual obligation are met customer incentive which are primarily provided for shipping specified cumulative volume or shipping to from specific location are recorded reduction to operating revenue based on actual or projected future customer shipment translation of

translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the year unrealized gain or loss are reflected within common shareholder equity accumulated other comprehensive income or loss fair value measurement we use fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the input to valuation technique used to measure fair value into three broad level the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in it entirety fall is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in it entirety these level include level quoted market price in active market for identical asset or liability level observable market based input or unobservable input that are corroborated by market data level unobservable input that are not corroborated by market data we have applied fair value measurement to our short term investment pension plan asset and short and long term debt stock based compensation we have several stock based compensation plan under which employee and non employee director receive stock option nonvested retention share and nonvested stock unit we refer to the nonvested share and stock unit collectively retention award we have elected to issue treasury share to cover option exercise and stock unit vestings while new share are issued when retention share are granted we measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based award made to employee and director including stock option compensation expense is based on the calculated fair value of the award measured at the grant date and is expensed ratably over the service period of the award generally the vesting period the fair value of retention award is the closing stock price on the date of grant while the fair value of stock option is determined by using the black scholes option pricing model earnings per share basic earnings per share are calculated on the weighted average number of common share outstanding during each period diluted earnings per share include share issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock option and stock based award where the conversion of such instrument would be dilutive income tax we account for income tax by recording tax payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax asset and liability for the expected future tax consequence of event that have been recognized in our financial statement or tax return these expected future tax consequence are measured based on current tax law the effect of future tax legislation are not anticipated future tax legislation such change in the corporate tax rate could have material impact on our financial condition result of operation or liquidity when appropriate we record valuation allowance against deferred tax asset to reflect that these tax asset may not be realized in determining whether valuation allowance is appropriate we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax asset will not be realized based on management judgment using available evidence for purpose of estimating whether future taxable income will be sufficient to realize deferred tax asset we recognize tax benefit that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authority the amount recognized is measured the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely to be realized upon settlement liability for unrecognized tax benefit is recorded for any tax benefit claimed in our tax return that do not meet these recognition and measurement standard pension and postretirement benefit we incur certain employment related expense associated with pension and postretirement health benefit in order to measure the expense associated with these benefit we must make various assumption including discount rate used to value certain liability expected return on plan asset used to fund these expense compensation increase employee turnover rate anticipated mortality rate and expected future health care cost the assumption used by are based on our historical experience well current fact and circumstance we use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability associated with these benefit personal injury the cost of injury to employee and others on our property is charged to expense based on estimate of the ultimate cost and number of incident each year we use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability our personal injury liability is not discounted to present value legal fee and incidental cost are expensed incurred asbestos we estimate liability for asserted and unasserted asbestos related claim based on an assessment of the number and value of those claim we use statistical analysis to assist in properly measuring our potential liability our liability for asbestos related claim is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payment legal fee and incidental cost are expensed incurred environmental when environmental issue have been identified with respect to property currently or formerly owned leased or otherwise used in the conduct of our business we perform with the assistance of our consultant environmental assessment on such property we expense the cost of the assessment incurred we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such cost can be reasonably estimated we do not discount our environmental liability when the timing of the anticipated cash payment is not fixed or readily determinable legal fee and incidental cost are expensed incurred use of estimate the preparation of our consolidated financial statement in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect certain reported asset and liability and the disclosure of certain contingent asset and liability of the date of the consolidated financial statement well the reported amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period actual future result may differ from such estimate accounting pronouncement in may the fasb issued accounting standard update no asu revenue from contract with customer topic asu supersedes the revenue recognition guidance in topic revenue recognition the core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised good and service to customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in the exchange for those good or service this may require the use of more judgment and estimate in order to correctly recognize the revenue expected an outcome of each specific performance obligation additionally this guidance will require the disclosure of the nature amount and timing of revenue arising from contract so to aid in the understanding of the user of financial statement this standard is effective for annual reporting period beginning after december the company ha analyzed our freight and other revenue and we expect to continue to recognize freight revenue freight move from origin to destination and to recognize other revenue identified performance obligation are satisfied we have also analyzed freight and other revenue in the context of the new guidance on principal versus agent consideration and evaluated the required new disclosure effective january the company adopted asu using the modified retrospective transition method the asu did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position result of operation or cash flow in january the fasb issued accounting standard update no asu recognition and measurement of financial asset and financial liability subtopic asu provides guidance for the recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instrument this guidance is effective for annual and interim period beginning after december and early adoption is not permitted asu is not expected to have material impact on our consolidated financial position result of operation or cash flow in march the fasb issued accounting standard update no asu improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost topic asu requires the service cost component be reported separately from the other component of net benefit cost in the income statement provides explicit guidance on the presentation of the service cost component and the other component of net benefit cost in the income statement and allows only the service cost component of net benefit cost to be eligible for capitalization this standard is effective for annual and interim reporting period beginning after december and we intend to adopt the standard beginning in using retrospective adoption the company currently record service cost and net benefit cost within compensation and benefit expense upon adoption the service cost will be recorded within compensation and benefit expense and the other component of net benefit cost including million related to the workforce reduction plan described in note will be recorded in other income the retrospective impact of future adoption is shown in the table below million increase decrease in operating income increase decrease in other income in february the fasb issued accounting standard update no asu lease subtopic asu will require company to recognize lease asset and lease liability on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangement for public company this standard is effective for annual reporting period beginning after december and early adoption is permitted management is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial position result of operation and cash flow and expects that the adoption will result in an increase in the company asset and liability of over billion on december the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effect of the tax cut and job act the tax act sab provides measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the enactment date for company to complete the accounting under accounting standard codification asc in

allocation are monitored monthly and rebalancing action are executed at least quarterly needed the pension plan investment are held in master trust the majority of pension plan asset are invested in equity security because equity portfolio have historically provided higher return than debt and other asset class over extended time horizon and are expected to do so in the future correspondingly equity investment also entail greater risk than other investment equity risk are balanced by investing significant portion of the plan asset in high quality debt security the average credit rating of the debt portfolio exceeded at both december and december the debt portfolio is also broadly diversified and invested primarily in treasury mortgage and corporate security the weighted average

freight car work equipment and other total equipment technology and other construction in progress total other roadway includes grading bridge and tunnel signal building and other road asset property and depreciation our railroad operation are highly capital intensive and our large base of homogeneous network type asset turn over on continuous basis each year we develop capital program for the replacement of asset and for the acquisition or construction of asset that enable to enhance our operation or provide new service offering to customer asset purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum unit of property criterion property and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on straight line basis over their estimated service life which are measured in year except for rail in high density traffic corridor all rail line except for those subject to abandonment yard and switching track and electronic yard for which life are measured in million of gross ton per mile of track we use the group method of depreciation in which all item with similar characteristic use and expected life are grouped together in asset class and are depreciated using composite depreciation rate the group method of depreciation treat each asset class pool of resource not singular item we currently have more than depreciable asset class and we may increase or decrease the number of asset class due to change in technology asset strategy or other factor we determine the estimated service life of depreciable railroad asset by mean of depreciation study we perform depreciation study at least every three year for equipment and every six year for track asset rail and other track material tie and ballast and other road property our depreciation study take into account the following factor statistical analysis of historical pattern of use and retirement of each of our asset class evaluation of any expected change in current operation and the outlook for continued use of the asset evaluation of technological advance and change to maintenance practice and expected salvage to be received upon retirement for rail in high density traffic corridor we measure estimated service life in million of gross ton per mile of track it ha been our experience that the life of rail in high density traffic corridor are closely correlated to usage the amount of weight carried over the rail the service life also vary based on rail weight rail condition new or secondhand and rail type straight or curve our depreciation study for rail in high density traffic corridor consider each of these factor in determining the estimated service life for rail in high density traffic corridor we calculate depreciation rate annually by dividing the number of gross ton mile carried over the rail the weight of loaded and empty freight car locomotive and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail by the estimated service life of the rail measured in million of gross ton per mile for all other depreciable asset we compute depreciation based on the estimated service life of our asset determined from the analysis of our depreciation study change in the estimated service life of our asset and their related depreciation rate are implemented prospectively under group depreciation the historical cost net of salvage of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized the historical cost of certain track asset is estimated by multiplying the current replacement cost of track asset by historical index factor derived from inflation index published by the bureau of labor statistic and ii the estimated useful life of the asset determined by our depreciation study the index were selected because they closely correlate with the major cost of the property comprising the applicable track asset class because of the number of estimate inherent in the depreciation and retirement process and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variable until group of property is completely retired we continually monitor the estimated service life of our asset and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rate are appropriate in addition we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by our depreciation study any deficiency or excess is amortized component of depreciation expense over the remaining service life of the applicable class of asset for retirement of depreciable railroad property that do not occur in the normal course of business gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meet each of the following three condition is unusual ii is material in amount and iii varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation study gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of asset that are not part of our railroad operation when we purchase an asset we capitalize all cost necessary to make the asset ready for it intended use however many of our asset are self constructed large portion of our capital expenditure is for replacement of existing track asset and other road property which is typically performed by our employee and for track line expansion and other capacity project cost that are directly attributable to capital project including overhead cost are capitalized direct cost that are capitalized part of self constructed asset include material labor and work equipment indirect cost are capitalized if they clearly relate to the construction of the asset normal repair and maintenance are expensed incurred while cost incurred that extend the useful life of an asset improve the safety of our operation or improve operating efficiency are capitalized these cost are allocated using appropriate statistical base total expense for repair and maintenance incurred wa billion for billion for and billion for asset held under capital lease are recorded at the lower of the net present

have entered into various lease transaction in which the structure of the lease contain variable interest entity vies these vies were created solely for the purpose of doing lease transaction principally involving railroad equipment and facility and have no other activity asset or liability outside of the lease transaction within these lease arrangement we have the right to purchase some or all of the asset at fixed price depending on market condition fixed price purchase option available in the lease could potentially provide benefit to however these benefit are not expected to be significant we maintain and operate the asset based on contractual obligation within the lease arrangement which set specific guideline consistent within the railroad industry such we have no control over activity that could materially impact the fair value of the leased asset we do not hold the power to direct the activity of the vies and therefore do not control the ongoing activity that have significant impact on the economic performance of the vies additionally we do not have the obligation to absorb loss of the vies or the right to receive benefit of the vies that could potentially be significant to the vies we are not considered to be the primary beneficiary and do not consolidate these vies because our action and decision do not have the most significant effect on the vie

that any known lawsuit claim environmental cost commitment contingent liability or guarantee will have material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation financial condition or liquidity after taking into account liability and insurance recovery previously recorded for these matter personal injury the cost of personal injury to employee and others related to our activity is charged to expense based on estimate of the ultimate cost and number of incident each year we use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability including unasserted claim the federal employer liability act fela governs compensation for work related accident under fela damage are assessed based on finding of fault through litigation or out of court settlement we offer comprehensive variety of service and rehabilitation program for employee who are injured at work our personal injury liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payment approximately of the recorded liability is related to asserted claim and approximately is related to unasserted claim at december because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claim it is reasonably possible that future cost to settle these claim may range from approximately million to million we record an accrual at the low end of the range no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other estimate can vary over time due to evolving trend in litigation our personal injury liability activity wa follows million beginning balance current year accrual change in estimate for prior year payment ending balance at december current portion ending balance at december in conjunction with the liability update performed in we also reassessed our estimated insurance recovery we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recovery at december and any change to recorded insurance recovery are included in the above table in the change in estimate for prior year category asbestos we are defendant in number of lawsuit in which current and former employee and other party allege exposure to asbestos we ass our potential liability using statistical analysis of resolution cost for asbestos related claim this liability is updated annually and excludes future defense and processing cost the liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claim wa based on the following assumption the ratio of future claim by alleged disease would be consistent with historical average adjusted for inflation the number of claim filed against will decline each year the average settlement value for asserted and unasserted claim will be equivalent to historical average the percentage of claim dismissed in the future will be equivalent to historical average our liability for asbestos related claim is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payment approximately of the recorded liability related to asserted claim and approximately related to unasserted claim at december because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of asbestos related claim it is reasonably possible that future cost to settle these claim may range from approximately million to million we record an accrual at the low end of the range no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other our asbestos related liability activity wa follows million beginning balance accrual credit payment ending balance at december current portion ending balance at december in conjunction with the liability update performed in we also reassessed our estimated insurance recovery we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recovery at december and the amount recorded for asbestos related liability and related insurance recovery were based on currently known fact however future event such the number of new claim filed each year average settlement cost and insurance coverage issue could cause the actual cost and insurance recovery to be higher or lower than the projected amount estimate also may vary in the future if strategy activity and outcome of asbestos litigation materially change federal and state law governing asbestos litigation increase or decrease the probability or amount of compensation of claimant and there are material change with respect to payment made to claimant by other defendant environmental cost we are subject to federal state and local environmental law and regulation we have identified site at which we are or may be liable for remediation cost associated with alleged contamination or for violation of environmental requirement this includes site that are the subject of action taken by the government of which are currently on the superfund national priority list certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified site consequently our ultimate environmental liability may include cost relating to activity of other party in addition to cost relating to our own activity at each site when we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned leased or otherwise used in our business we perform with assistance of our consultant environmental assessment on the property we expense the cost of the assessment incurred we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such cost can be reasonably estimated our environmental liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payment our environmental liability activity wa follows million beginning balance accrual payment ending balance at december current portion ending balance at december the environmental liability includes future cost for remediation and restoration of site well ongoing monitoring cost but excludes any anticipated recovery from third party cost estimate are based on information available for each site financial viability of other potentially responsible party and existing technology law and regulation the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible party site specific cost sharing arrangement with other potentially responsible party the degree of contamination by various waste the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the site and the speculative nature of remediation cost estimate of liability may vary over time due to change in federal state and local law governing environmental remediation current obligation are not expected to have material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation financial condition or liquidity insurance the company ha consolidated wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary the captive that provides insurance coverage for certain risk including fela claim and property coverage which are subject to reinsurance the captive entered into annual reinsurance treaty agreement that insure worker compensation general liability auto liability and fela risk the captive cedes portion of it fela exposure through the treaty and assumes proportionate share of the entire risk the captive receives direct premium which are netted against the company premium cost in other expense in the consolidated statement of income the treaty agreement provide for certain protection against the risk of treaty participant non performance and we do not believe our exposure to treaty participant non performance is material at this time in the event the company leaf the reinsurance program the company is not relieved of it primary obligation to the policyholder for activity prior to the termination of the treaty agreement we record both

liable for million and million in guarantee respectively the fair value of these obligation of both december and wa we entered into these contingent guarantee in the normal course of business and they include guaranteed obligation related to our affiliated operation the final guarantee expires in we are not aware of any existing event of default that would require to satisfy these guarantee we do not expect that these guarantee will have material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition result of operation or liquidity indemnity we are contingently obligated under variety of indemnification arrangement although in some case the extent of our potential liability is limited depending on the nature of the transaction and the agreement due to uncertainty to whether claim will be made or how they will be resolved we can not reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangement we do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payment under these indemnity provision share repurchase program effective january our
