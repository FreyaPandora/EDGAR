the company six reporting unit coating performance monomer consumer solution hydrocarbon energy industrial solution packaging and specialty plastic and polyurethane construction chemical the ecp business received part of the separation from dowdupont are included in the hydrocarbon energy and packaging and specialty plastic reporting unit at december goodwill wa carried by five out of six of the company reporting unit the company ha the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying value qualitative factor assessed at the company level include but are not limited to gdp growth rate long term hydrocarbon and energy price equity and credit market activity discount rate foreign exchange rate and overall financial performance qualitative factor assessed at the reporting unit level include but are not limited to change in industry and market structure competitive environment planned capacity and new product launch cost factor such raw material price and financial performance of the reporting unit if the company chooses not to complete qualitative assessment for given reporting unit or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying value additional quantitative testing is required quantitative testing requires the fair value of the reporting unit to be compared with it carrying value if the reporting unit carrying value exceeds it fair value an impairment charge is recognized for the difference the company utilizes discounted cash flow methodology to calculate the fair value of it reporting unit this valuation technique ha been selected by management the most meaningful valuation method due to the limited number of market comparables for the company reporting unit however where market comparables are available the company includes ebit ebitda multiple part of the reporting unit valuation analysis the discounted cash flow valuation are completed using the following key assumption projected revenue growth rate or compounded annual growth rate discount rate tax rate terminal value currency exchange rate and forecasted long term hydrocarbon and energy price by geographic region and by year which include the company key feedstock well natural gas and crude oil due to it correlation to naphtha currency exchange rate and long term hydrocarbon and energy price are established for the company whole and applied consistently to all reporting unit while revenue growth rate discount rate and tax rate are established by reporting unit to account for difference in business fundamental and industry risk these key assumption drive projected ebit ebitda and ebit ebitda margin which are key element of management internal control over the reporting unit valuation analysis goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of quantitative testing wa performed on two reporting unit and qualitative assessment wa performed for the remaining reporting unit for the qualitative assessment management considered the factor at both the company level and the reporting unit level based on the qualitative assessment management concluded it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is le than the carrying value of the reporting unit upon completion of the quantitative testing in the fourth quarter of the company determined the coating performance monomer pm reporting unit wa impaired during the pm reporting unit did not consistently meet expected financial performance target primarily due to the industry increased captive use of coating product which led to volume reduction reduced margin for product across the portfolio due to change in customer buying pattern and supply and demand balance well continued trend of customer consolidation in end market which reduced growth opportunity result the pm reporting unit lowered it future revenue and profitability projection which were used in determining the fair value of the pm reporting unit using discounted cash flow methodology these discounted cash flow did not support the carrying value of the pm reporting unit result the company recorded goodwill impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of the pm reporting unit did not carry goodwill balance at december the fair value of the other reporting unit exceeded it carrying value and no other goodwill impairment were identified result of the testing pension and other postretirement benefitsas result of the company separation from dowdupont the number of defined benefit pension plan administered by the company decreased from plan to plan with approximately million of net unfunded pension liability transferring to dowdupont plan administered by other subsidiary of dowdupont that were transferred to the company were not significant there were no change in the number of other postretirement benefit plan administered by the company result of the separation the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statement related to pension and other

recorded in future period the pension plan represent percent of the company pension plan asset and percent of the pension obligation of contentsthe company us the spot rate approach to determine the discount rate utilized to measure the service cost and interest cost component of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost for the and other selected country under the spot rate approach the company calculates service cost and interest cost by applying individual spot rate from the willis tower watson rate link yield curve based on high quality corporate bond yield for each selected country to the separate expected cash flow component of service cost and interest cost service cost and interest cost for all other plan including all plan prior to adoption are determined on the basis of the single equivalent discount rate derived in determining those plan obligation the following information relates to the plan only similar approach is used for the company non plan the company determines the expected long term rate of return on asset by performing detailed analysis of historical and expected return based on the strategic asset allocation approved by the company investment committee and the underlying return fundamental of each asset class the company historical experience with the pension fund asset performance is also considered the expected return of each asset class is derived from forecasted future return confirmed by historical experience the expected long term rate of return is an assumption and not is expected to be earned in any one particular year the weighted average long term rate of return assumption used for determining net periodic pension expense for wa percent the weighted average assumption to be used for determining net periodic pension expense is percent future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance change in future discount rate and various other factor related to the population of participant

investment gain or loss over five year period from the year in which they occur investment gain or loss for this purpose represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of plan asset and the actual return based on the market value of plan asset since the market related value of plan asset recognizes gain or loss over five year period the future value will be impacted when previously deferred gain or loss are recorded over the life of the plan both gain and loss have been recognized and amortized at december net gain of million remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of plan asset these net gain will result in decrease in future pension expense they are recognized in the market related value of asset the

corporationintroductionunion carbide is and ha been involved in large number of asbestos related suit filed primarily in state court during the past four decade these suit principally allege personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos containing product and frequently seek both actual and punitive damage the alleged claim primarily relate to product that union carbide sold in the past alleged exposure to asbestos containing product located on union carbide premise and union carbide responsibility for asbestos suit filed against former union carbide subsidiary amchem product inc amchem in many case plaintiff are unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any compensable loss result of such exposure or that injury incurred in fact resulted from exposure to union carbide product union carbide expects more asbestos related suit to be filed against union carbide and amchem in the future and will aggressively defend or reasonably resolve appropriate both pending and future claim estimating the asbestos related liabilitybased on study completed by ankura consulting group llc ankura in january union carbide increased it december asbestos related liability for pending and future claim for year period ending in to billion excluding future defense and processing cost in subsequent year union carbide compared current asbestos claim and resolution activity to the result of the most recent ankura study at each balance sheet date to determine whether the accrual continued to be appropriate in ankura completed study to provide estimate for the undiscounted cost of disposing of pending and future claim against union carbide and amchem through the terminal year of including reasonable forecast of future defense and processing cost based on the study and union carbide internal review of asbestos claim and resolution activity union carbide determined estimating the liability through the terminal year of wa more appropriate due to increased knowledge and data about the cost to resolve claim and diminished volatility in filing rate union carbide and the company also determined that estimating and accruing liability for future asbestos related defense and processing cost wa more appropriate such cost represent expenditure related to legacy activity that do not contribute to current or future revenue generating activity of union carbide and the company and is also reflective of the manner in which union carbide manages it asbestos related exposure including careful monitoring of the correlation between defense spending and resolution cost result in the fourth quarter of union carbide recorded million increase in it asbestos related liability for pending and future claim including future defense and processing cost each october union carbide request ankura to review it historical asbestos claim and resolution activity through the third quarter of the current year including asbestos related defense and processing cost to determine the appropriateness of updating the most recent study of contentsin december ankura stated that an update of it december study would not provide more likely estimate of future event than the estimate reflected in the study and therefore the estimate in the study remained applicable based on union carbide internal review process and ankura response union carbide determined that no change to the accrual wa required in december ankura completed study of union carbide historical asbestos claim and resolution activity through september including asbestos related defense and processing cost and provided estimate for the undiscounted cost of disposing of pending and future claim against union carbide and amchem through the terminal year of based on the study and union carbide internal review process it wa determined that no adjustment to the accrual wa required at december union carbide asbestos related liability for pending and future claim and defense and processing cost wa million and approximately percent of the recorded liability related to pending claim and approximately percent related to future claim in december ankura stated that an update of it december study would not provide more likely estimate of future event than the estimate reflected in the study and therefore the estimate in the study remained applicable based on union carbide internal review process and ankura response union carbide determined that no change to the accrual wa required at december the asbestos related liability for pending and future claim against union carbide and amchem including future asbestos related defense and processing cost wa million and approximately percent of the recorded liability related to pending claim and approximately percent related to future claim summarythe company management belief the amount recorded by union carbide for the asbestos related liability including defense and processing cost reflect reasonable and probable estimate of the liability based upon current known fact however future event such the number of new claim to be filed and or received each year the average cost of defending and disposing of each such claim well the numerous uncertainty surrounding asbestos litigation in the united state over significant period of time could cause the actual cost for union carbide to be higher or lower than those projected or those recorded any such event could result in an increase or decrease in the recorded liability because of the uncertainty described above union carbide can not estimate the full range of the cost of resolving pending and future asbestos related claim facing union carbide and amchem result it is reasonably possible that an additional cost of disposing of union carbide asbestos related claim including future defense and processing cost could have material impact on the company result of operation and cash flow for particular period and on the consolidated financial position dow silicone chapter related mattersintroductionin dow silicone then joint venture between the company and corning incorporated corning voluntarily filed for protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code in order to resolve dow silicone breast implant liability and related matter the chapter proceeding dow silicone emerged from the chapter proceeding on june the effective date and is implementing the

the satisfaction of commercial creditor claim in the chapter proceeding of june dow silicone is wholly owned subsidiary of the company breast implant and other product liability claimsunder the plan product liability settlement program administered by an independent claim office the settlement facility wa created to resolve breast implant and other product liability claim product liability claimant rejecting the settlement program in favor of pursuing litigation must bring suit against litigation facility the litigation facility under the plan total payment committed by dow silicone to resolving product liability claim are capped at maximum million net present value npv determined of the effective date using discount rate of seven percent approximately million undiscounted at december of this amount no more than million npv determined of the effective date can be used to fund the litigation facility dow silicone ha an obligation to fund the settlement facility and the

facility reported an unexpended balance of million of contentsin accordance with asc accounting for contingency the company record liability for breast implant and other product liability claim implant liability which reflects the estimated impact of the settlement of future claim primarily based on reported claim filing level in the revised settlement program the rsp and on the resolution of almost all case pending against the litigation facility the rsp wa program sponsored by certain other breast implant manufacturer in the context of multi district coordinated federal breast implant case and wa open from through the rsp wa also revised successor to an earlier settlement plan involving dow silicone prior to it bankruptcy filing while dow silicone withdrew from the rsp many of the benefit category and payment level in dow silicone settlement program were drawn from the rsp based on the comparability in design and actual claim experience of both plan management concluded that claim information from the rsp provides reasonable basis to estimate future claim filing level for the settlement facility in the third quarter of with the assistance of third party consultant consultant dow silicone updated it implant liability estimate to million primarily reflecting decrease in class claim decrease resulting from the passage of time decreased claim filing activity and administrative cost compared with the previous estimate and an increase in investment income resulting from insurance proceeds based on the consultant updated estimate and dow silicone own review of claim filing activity dow silicone determined that an adjustment to the implant liability wa required accordingly dow silicone decreased it implant liability in the third quarter of by million included in sundry income expense net in the consolidated statement of income and also decreased it corresponding class receivable in the third quarter of resulting in charge of million included in

december million at december wa included in accrued and other current liability and million at december million at december wa included in other noncurrent obligation in the consolidated balance sheet dow silicone is not aware of circumstance that would change the factor used in estimating the implant liability and belief the recorded liability reflects the best estimate of the remaining funding obligation under the plan however the estimate relies upon number of significant assumption including future acceptance rate disease mix and payment value will be materially consistent with historical experience no material negative outcome in future controversy or dispute over plan interpretation will occur and the plan will not be modified if actual outcome related to any of these assumption prove to be materially different the future liability to fund the plan may be materially different than the amount estimated if dow silicone wa ultimately required to fund the full liability up to the maximum capped value the liability would be million at december commercial creditor issuesthe plan provides that each of dow silicone commercial creditor the commercial creditor would receive in cash
