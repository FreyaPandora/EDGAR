offering experience service disruption or failure or other quality issue in addition profitability if any in our newer activity may not meet our expectation and we may not be successful enough in these newer activity to recoup our investment in failure to realize the benefit of amount we invest in new technology product or service could result in the value of those investment being written or written our international operation expose to number of risksour international activity are significant to our revenue and profit and we plan to expand internationally in certain international market segment we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first to market advantage or otherwise succeed it is costly to establish develop and maintain international operation and store and promote our brand internationally our international operation may not become profitable on sustained basis in addition to risk described elsewhere in this section our international sale and operation are subject to number of risk including local economic and political condition government regulation such regulation of our product and service offering and of competition restrictive governmental action such trade protection measure including export duty and quota and custom duty and tariff nationalization and restriction on foreign ownership restriction on sale or distribution of certain product or service and uncertainty regarding liability for product service and content including uncertainty result of le internet friendly legal system local law lack of legal precedent and varying rule regulation and practice regarding the physical and digital distribution of medium product and enforcement of intellectual property right of content business licensing or certification requirement such for import export web service and electronic device limitation on the repatriation and investment of fund and foreign currency exchange restriction limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure shorter payable and longer receivable cycle and the resultant negative impact on cash flow law and regulation regarding privacy data protection data security network security consumer protection payment advertising and restriction on pricing or discount lower level of use of the internet lower level of consumer spending and fewer opportunity for growth compared to the lower level of credit card usage and increased payment risk difficulty in staffing developing and managing foreign operation result of distance language and cultural difference different employee employer relationship and the existence of work council and labor union compliance with the foreign corrupt practice act and other applicable and foreign law prohibiting corrupt payment to government official and other third party law and policy of the and other jurisdiction affecting trade foreign investment loan and tax and geopolitical event including war and terrorism international physical commerce and omnichannel retail and other service grow competition intensify including through adoption of evolving business model local company may have substantial competitive advantage of their greater understanding of and focus on the local customer well their more established local brand name the inability to hire train retain and manage sufficient required personnel may limit our international growth the people republic of china prc and india regulate amazon and it affiliate business and operation in country through regulation and license requirement that may restrict foreign investment in and operation of the internet it infrastructure data center retail delivery and other sector ii internet content and iii the sale of medium and other product and service for example in order to meet local ownership regulatory licensing and cybersecurity requirement we provide certain technology service in china through contractual relationship with third party that hold prc license to provide service in india the government restricts the ownership or control of indian company by foreign entity involved in online multi brand retail trading activity for www amazon in we provide certain marketing tool and logistics service to third party seller to enable them to sell online and deliver to customer and we hold indirect minority interest in entity that are third party seller on the www amazon in marketplace although we believe these structure and activity comply with existing law they involve unique risk and the prc and india may from time to time consider and implement additional change in their regulatory licensing or other requirement that could impact these structure and activity are substantial uncertainty regarding the interpretation of prc and indian law and regulation and it is possible that these government will ultimately take view contrary to ours in addition our chinese and indian business and operation may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliate are unable to access sufficient funding or in china enforce contractual relationship we or our affiliate have in place violation of any existing or future prc indian or other law or regulation or change in the interpretation of those law and regulation could result in our business in those country being subject to fine and other financial penalty license revoked or being forced to restructure our operation or shut down entirely of contentsthe variability in our retail business place increased strain on our operationsdemand for our product and service can fluctuate significantly for many reason including result of seasonality promotion product launch or unforeseeable event such in response to natural or man made disaster extreme weather or geopolitical event for example we expect disproportionate amount of our retail sale to occur during our fourth quarter our failure to stock or restock popular product in sufficient amount such that we fail to meet customer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth we overstock product we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write offs and incur commitment cost which could materially reduce profitability we regularly experience increase in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrade split shipment and additional long zone shipment necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season if many customer access our website within short period of time due to increased demand we may experience system interruption that make our website unavailable or prevent from efficiently fulfilling order which may reduce the volume of good we offer or sell and the attractiveness of our product and service in addition we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service center during these peak period and delivery and other fulfillment company and customer service co sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand risk described elsewhere in this item relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory are magnified during period of high demand we generally have payment term with our retail vendor that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumer customer result of holiday sale of december of each year our cash cash equivalent and marketable security balance typically reach their highest level other than result of cash flow provided by or used in investing and financing activity this operating cycle result in corresponding increase in account payable of december our account payable balance generally decline during the first three month of the year resulting in corresponding decline in our cash cash equivalent and marketable security balance we are impacted by fraudulent or unlawful activity of sellersthe law relating to the liability of online service provider is currently unsettled in addition governmental agency have in the past and could in the future require change in the way this business is conducted under our seller program we maintain policy and process designed to prevent seller from collecting payment fraudulently or otherwise when buyer never receive the product they ordered or when the product received are materially different from the seller description and to prevent seller in our store or through other store from selling unlawful counterfeit pirated or stolen good selling good in an unlawful or unethical manner violating the proprietary right of others or otherwise violating our policy when these policy and process are circumvented or fail to operate sufficiently it can harm our business or damage our reputation and we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activity by our seller under our guarantee we reimburse buyer for payment to certain limit in these situation and our third party seller sale grow the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating result we face risk related to adequately protecting our intellectual property right and being accused of infringing intellectual property right of third partieswe regard our trademark service mark copyright patent trade dress trade secret proprietary technology and similar intellectual property critical to our success and we rely on trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality and or license agreement with our employee customer and others to protect our proprietary right effective intellectual property protection is not available in every country in which our product and service are made available we also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain name in all country in which we do business furthermore regulation governing domain name may not protect our trademark and similar proprietary right we may be unable to prevent third party from acquiring domain name that are similar to infringe upon or diminish the value of our trademark and other proprietary right we are not always able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary right action taken by third party that license our proprietary right may materially diminish the value of our proprietary right or reputation the protection of our intellectual property requires the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resource moreover the step we take to protect our intellectual property do not always adequately protect our right or prevent third party from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary right we also can not be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property right we have been subject to and expect to continue to be subject to claim and legal proceeding regarding alleged infringement by of the intellectual property right of third party such claim whether or not meritorious have in the past and may in the future result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resource injunction against or significant payment for damage including to satisfy indemnification obligation or to obtain license from third party allege that we have infringed their right such license may not be available on term acceptable to or all these risk have been amplified by the increase in third party whose sole or primary business is to assert such claim of contentsour digital content offering depend in part on effective digital right management technology to control access to digital content breach or malfunctioning of the digital right management technology that we use could subject to claim and content provider may be unwilling to include their content in our service we have foreign exchange riskthe result of operation of and certain of our intercompany balance associated with our international store and product and service offering are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuation due to these fluctuation operating result may differ materially from expectation and we may record significant gain or loss on the remeasurement of intercompany balance we have expanded our international operation our exposure to exchange rate fluctuation ha increased we also hold cash equivalent and or marketable security in foreign currency including euro british pound and japanese yen when the dollar strengthens compared to these currency cash equivalent and marketable security balance when translated may be materially le than expected and vice versa operating risksour expansion place significant strain on our management operational financial and other resourceswe are continuing to rapidly and significantly expand our global operation including increasing our product and service offering and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and service business the complexity of the current scale of our business can place significant strain on our management personnel operation system technical performance financial resource and internal financial control and reporting function and our expansion increase these factor failure to manage growth effectively could damage our reputation limit our growth and negatively affect our operating result we experience significant fluctuation in our operating result and growth ratewe are not always able to accurately forecast our growth rate we base our expense level and investment plan on sale estimate significant portion of our expense and investment is fixed and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sale are le than expected our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rate may decrease our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the product and service offered by or our seller and our business is affected by general economic and business condition worldwide softening of demand whether caused by change in customer preference or weakening of the or global economy may result in decreased revenue or growth our sale and operating result will also fluctuate for many other reason including due to factor described elsewhere in this section and
