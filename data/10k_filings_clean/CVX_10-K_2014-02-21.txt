partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait the philippine republic of the congo singapore south africa south korea thailand trinidad and tobago the united kingdom the united state venezuela and vietnam earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of it upstream and downstream business segment the biggest factor affecting the result of operation for the company is the price of crude oil in the downstream business crude oil is the largest cost component of refined product seasonality is not primary driver of change in the company quarterly earnings during the year to sustain it long term competitive position in the upstream business the company must develop and replenish an inventory of project that offer attractive financial return for the investment required identifying promising area for exploration acquiring the necessary right to explore for and to produce crude oil and natural gas drilling successfully and handling the many technical and operational detail in safe and cost effective manner are all important factor in this effort project often require long lead time and large capital commitment the company operation especially upstream can also be affected by changing economic regulatory and political environment in the various country in which it operates including the united state from time to time certain government have sought to renegotiate contract or impose additional cost on the company government may attempt to do in the future civil unrest act of violence or strained relation between government and the company or other government may impact the company operation or investment those development have at time significantly affected the company operation and result and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such country the company continually evaluates opportunity to dispose of asset that are not expected to provide sufficient long term value or to acquire asset or operation complementary to it asset base to help augment the company financial performance and growth refer to the result of operation section beginning on page for discussion of net gain on asset sale during asset disposition and restructurings may also occur in future period and could result in significant gain or loss the company closely monitor development in the financial and credit market the level of worldwide economic activity and the implication for the company of movement in price for crude oil and natural gas management take these development into account in the conduct of daily operation and for business planning comment related to earnings trend for the company major business area are follows upstream earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry price for crude oil and natural gas crude oil and natural gas price are subject to external factor over which the company ha no control including product demand connected with global economic condition industry inventory level production quota imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting country opec weather related damage and disruption competing fuel price and regional supply interruption or fear thereof that may be caused by military conflict civil unrest or political uncertainty any of these factor could also inhibit the production capacity in an affected region the company closely monitor development in the country in which it operates and hold investment and seek to manage risk in operating it facility and business the longer term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also function of other factor including the company ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas change in fiscal term of contract and change in tax law and regulation the company continues to actively manage it schedule of work contracting procurement and supply chain activity to effectively manage cost however price level for capital and exploratory cost and operating expense associated with the production of crude oil and natural gas can be subject to external factor beyond the company control external factor include not only the general level of inflation but also commodity price and price charged by the industry material and service provider which can be affected by the volatility of the industry own supply and demand condition for such material and service in recent year chevron and the oil and gas industrygenerally experienced an increase in certain cost thatexceeded the general trend of inflation in many area of theworld capital and exploratory expenditure and operating expense can also be affected by damage to production facility caused by severe weather or civil unrest the chart above show the trend in benchmark price for brent crude oil west texas intermediate wti crude oil and henry hub natural gas the brent price averaged per barrel for the full year compared to in of mid february the brent price wa per barrel the majority of the company equity crude production is priced based on the brent benchmark the wti price averaged per barrel for the full year compared to in of mid february the wti price wa per barrel wti continued to trade at discount to brent in due to historically high inventory stemming from strong growth in domestic production and limitation on outbound pipeline capacity from the midcontinent after narrowing during the first six month of the wti discount slowly widened into the fourth quarter seasonal refinery turnaround contributed to surplus supply condition for wti brent price were supported by supply disruption due to international event differential in crude oil price exists between high quality high gravity low sulfur crude and those of lower quality low gravity high sulfur the amount of the differential in any period is associated with the supply of heavy crude versus the demand which is function of the capacity of refinery that are able to process this lower quality feedstock into light product motor gasoline jet fuel aviation gasoline and diesel fuel during the differential between north american light and heavy crude oil remained below historical norm due to growth in light sweet crude production in the midcontinent region and pipeline capacity constraint at cushing outside of north america the light heavy crude differential narrowed modestly in supply disruption in key producing country tightened light sweet crude market and additional heavy crude oil conversion capacity came online chevron produce or share in the production of heavy crude oil in california chad indonesia the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait venezuela and in certain field in angola china and the united kingdom sector of the north sea see page for the company average and international crude oil realization in contrast to price movement in the global market for crude oil price change for natural gas in many regional market are more closely aligned with supply and demand condition in those market in the united state price at henry hub averaged per thousand cubic foot mcf during compared with during of mid february the henry hub spot price wa per discussion and analysis offinancial condition and result of operation mcf fluctuation in the price of natural gas in the united state are closely associated with customer demand relative to the volume produced in north america outside the united state price change for natural gas depend on wide range of supply demand and regulatory circumstance in some location chevron is investing in long term project to install infrastructure to produce and liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker to other market international natural gas realization averaged about per mcf during compared with per mcf during see page for the company average natural gas realization for the and international region the company worldwide net oil equivalent production in averaged million barrel per day about one fifth of the company net oil equivalent production in occurred in the opec member country of angola nigeria venezuela and the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait opec quota had no effect on the company net crude oil production in or at their december meeting member of opec supported maintaining the current production quota of million barrel per day which ha been in effect since december the company estimate that oil equivalent production in will average approximately million barrel per day based on an average brent price of per barrel for the full year this estimate is subject to many factor and uncertainty including quota that may be imposed by opec price effect on entitlement volume change in fiscal term or restriction on the scope of company operation delay in construction start up or ramp up of project fluctuation in demand for natural gas in various market weather condition that may shut in production civil unrest changing geopolitics delay in completion of maintenance turnaround greater than expected decline in production from mature field or other disruption to operation the outlook for future production level is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunity and for new large scale project the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production investment in upstream project generally begin well in advance of the start of the associated crude oil and natural gas production significant majority of chevron upstream investment is made outside the united state refer to the result of operation section on page through for additional discussion of the company upstream business refer to table beginning on page for tabulation of the company proved net oil and gas reserve by geographic area at the beginning of and each year end from through and an accompanying discussion of major change to proved reserve by geographic area for the three year period ending december on november while drilling development well

barrel of oil the source of the seep wa substantially contained within four day and the well wa plugged and abandoned on march the company identified small second seep in different part of the field no evidence of any coastal or wildlife impact to these seeps have emerged brazilian federal district prosecutor filed two civil lawsuit seeking billion in damage for each of the two seeps on october

matter and on appeal the appellate court reinstated two of the ten allegation specifically those charge alleging environmental damage and failure to provide timely notification to authority the company is assessing it legal option the company ultimate exposure related to the incident is not currently determinable but could be significant to net income in any one period downstream earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margin on the refining manufacturing and marketing of product that include gasoline diesel jet fuel lubricant fuel oil fuel and lubricant additive and petrochemical industry margin are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supply and demand balance for refined product and petrochemical and by change in the price of crude oil other refinery and petrochemical feedstock and natural gas industry margin can also be influenced by inventory level geopolitical event cost of material and service refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization maintenance program and disruption at refinery or chemical plant resulting from unplanned outage due to severe weather fire or other operational event other factor affecting profitability for downstream operation include the reliability and efficiency of the company refining marketing and petrochemical asset the effectiveness of it crude oil and product supply function and the volatility of tanker charter rate for the company shipping operation which are driven by the industry demand for crude oil and product tanker other factor beyond the company control include the general level of inflation and energy cost to operate the company refining marketing and petrochemical asset the company most significant marketing area are the west coast of north america the

management make many estimate and assumption in the application of generally accepted accounting principle gaap that may have material impact on the company consolidated financial statement and related disclosure and on the comparability of such information over different reporting period all such estimate and assumption affect reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense well disclosure of contingent asset and liability estimate and assumption are based on management experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statement materially different result can occur circumstance change and additional information becomes known discussion and analysis offinancial condition and result of operation the discussion in this section of critical accounting estimate and assumption is according to the disclosure guideline of the security and exchange commission sec wherein the nature of the estimate and assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matter or the susceptibility of such matter to change the impact of the estimate and assumption on the company financial condition or operating performance is material the development and selection of accounting estimate and assumption including those deemed critical and the associated disclosure in this discussion have been discussed by management with the audit committee of the board of director the area of accounting and the associated critical estimate and assumption made by the company are follows oil and gas reserve crude oil and natural gas reserve are estimate of future production that impact certain asset and expense account included in the consolidated financial statement proved reserve are the estimated quantity of oil and gas that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future under existing economic condition operating method and government regulation proved reserve include both developed and undeveloped volume proved developed reserve represent volume expected to be recovered through existing well with existing equipment and operating method proved undeveloped reserve are volume expected to be recovered from new well on undrilled proved acreage or from existing well where relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion variable impacting chevron estimated volume of crude oil and natural gas reserve include field performance available technology and economic condition the estimate of crude oil and natural gas reserve are important to the timing of expense recognition for cost incurred and to the valuation of certain oil and gas producing asset impact of oil and gas reserve on chevron consolidated financial statement using the successful effort method of accounting include the following amortization proved reserve are used in amortizing capitalized cost related to oil and gas producing activity on the unit of production uop method capitalized exploratory drilling and development cost are depreciated on uop basis using proved developed reserve acquisition cost of proved property are amortized on uop basis using total proved reserve during chevron uop depreciation depletion and amortization dd for oil and gas property wa billion and proved developed reserve at the beginning of were billion barrel if the estimate of proved reserve used in the uop calculation for consolidated operation had been lower by percent across all oil and gas property uop dd in would have increased by approximately million impairment oil and gas reserve are used in assessing oil and gas producing property for impairment significant reduction in the estimated reserve of property would trigger an impairment review in assessing whether the property is impaired the fair value of the property must be determined frequently discounted cash flow methodology is the best estimate of fair value proved reserve and in some case portion of unproved resource are used to estimate future production volume in the cash flow model for further discussion of estimate and assumption used in impairment assessment see impairment of property plant and equipment and investment in affiliate below refer to table reserve quantity information beginning on page for the change in proved reserve estimate for the three year ending december and to table vii change in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flow from proved reserve on page for estimate of proved reserve value for each of the three year ended december this oil and gas reserve commentary should be read in conjunction with the property plant and equipment section of note to the consolidated financial statement beginning on page which includes description of the successful effort method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activity impairment of property plant and equipment and investment in affiliate the company ass it property plant and equipment pp for possible impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable if the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flow expected from the asset an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value of the asset over it estimated fair value determination to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimate on highly uncertain matter such future commodity price the effect of inflation and technology improvement on operating expense production profile and the outlook for global or regional market supply and demand condition for crude oil natural gas commodity chemical and refined product however the impairment review and calculation are based on that are consistent with the company business plan and long term investment decision refer also to the discussion of impairment of property plant and equipment in note beginning on page and to the section on property plant and equipment in note summary of significant accounting policy beginning on page no material individual impairment of pp or investment were recorded for the three year ending december sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these period if other assumption had been used in impairment review and impairment calculation is not practicable given the broad range of the company pp and the number of assumption involved in the estimate that is favorable change to some assumption might have avoided the need to impair any asset in these period whereas unfavorable change might have caused an additional unknown number of other asset to become impaired investment in common stock of affiliate that are accounted for under the equity method well investment in other security of these equity investees are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment fall below the company carrying value when such decline is deemed to be other than temporary an impairment charge is recorded to the income statement for the difference between the investment carrying value and it estimated fair value at the time in making the determination to whether decline is other than temporary the company considers such factor the duration and extent of the decline the investee financial performance and the company ability and intention to retain it investment for period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment market value differing assumption could affect whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment and are not subject to sensitivity analysis from time to time the company performs impairment review and determines whether any write down in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required for example when significant downward revision to crude oil and natural gas reserve are made for any single field or concession an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset remains recoverable also if the expectation of sale of particular asset or asset group in any period ha been deemed more likely than not an impairment review is performed and if the estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group no impairment charge is required such calculation are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed of asset that are not impaired on held and used basis could possibly become impaired if decision is made to sell such asset that is the asset would be impaired if they are classified held for sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale le cost to sell are le than the asset associated carrying value asset retirement obligation in the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation aro the company us various assumption and judgment including such factor the existence of legal obligation estimated amount and timing of settlement discount and inflation rate and the expected impact of advance in technology and process improvement sensitivity analysis of the aro impact on earnings for is not practicable given the broad range of the company long lived asset and the number of assumption involved in the estimate that is favorable change to some assumption would have reduced estimated future obligation thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization cost whereas unfavorable change would have the opposite effect refer to note on page for additional discussion on asset retirement obligation pension and other postretirement benefit plan note beginning on page includes information on the funded status of the company pension and other postretirement benefit opeb plan reflected on the consolidated balance sheet the component of pension and opeb expense reflected on the consolidated statement of income and the related underlying assumption the determination of pension plan expense and obligation is based on number of actuarial assumption two critical assumption are the expected long term rate of return on plan asset and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligation critical assumption in determining expense and obligation for opeb plan which provide for certain health care and life insurance benefit for qualifying retired employee and which are not funded are the discount rate and the assumed health care cost trend rate information related to the company process to develop these assumption is included on page in note under the relevant heading actual rate may vary significantly

additionally with the exception of two other year within this year period actual asset return for this plan equaled or exceeded percent total pension expense for wa billion an increase in the expected long term return on plan asset or the discount rate would reduce pension plan expense and vice versa an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long term rate of return assumption percent increase in this assumption for the company primary pension plan which accounted for about percent of companywide pension expense would have reduced total pension plan expense for by approximately million percent increase in the discount rate for this plan would have reduced pension expense for by approximately million the aggregate funded status recognized at december wa net liability of approximately billion an increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation thus changing the funded status of plan at december the company used discount rate of discussion and analysis offinancial condition and result of operation percent to measure the obligation for the pension plan an indication of the sensitivity of pension liability to the discount rate assumption percent increase in the discount rate applied to the company primary pension plan which accounted for about percent of the companywide pension obligation would have reduced the plan

primarily to various development activity in the gulf of mexico and the midcontinent region in asia expenditure during the year totaled billion primarily related to development project in thailand indonesia and with the tco affiliate in kazakhstan in africa about billion wa expended on various offshore development and natural gas project in nigeria and angola proved undeveloped reserve for five year or more reserve that remain proved undeveloped for five or more year are result of several factor that affect optimal project development and execution such the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote location physical limitation of infrastructure or plant capacity that dictate project timing compression project that are pending reservoir pressure decline and contractual limitation that dictate production level table reserve quantity information continued at year end the company held approximately billion boe of proved undeveloped reserve that have remained undeveloped for five year or more the reserve are held by consolidated and affiliated company and the majority of these reserve are in location where the company ha proven track record of developing major project in africa the majority of the approximately million boe of proved undeveloped reserve that have remained undeveloped for five year or more is related to deepwater and natural gas development in nigeria major nigerian deepwater development project include agbami which started production in and ha ongoing development activity to maintain full utilization of infrastructure capacity and the usan development which started production in also in nigeria various field and infrastructure associated with the escravos gas project are currently under development in asia le than million boe remain classified proved undeveloped for more than five year the majority relate to ongoing development activity in the pattani field in thailand and the azeri chirag gunashli field in azerbaijan affiliate account for billion barrel of proved undeveloped reserve that have remained undeveloped for five year or more with the majority related to the tco affiliate in kazakhstan at tco further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserve is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion in venezuela development drilling continues at hamaca to optimize utilization of upgrader capacity annually the company ass whether any change have occurred in fact or circumstance such change to development plan regulation or government policy that would warrant revision to reserve estimate for this assessment did not result in any material change in reserve classified proved undeveloped over the past three year the ratio of proved undeveloped reserve to total proved reserve ha ranged between percent and percent the consistent completion of major capital project ha kept the ratio in narrow range over this time period proved reserve quantity at december proved reserve for the company were billion boe approximately percent of the total reserve were located in the united state aside from the tco affiliate tengiz field in kazakhstan no single property accounted for more than percent of the company total oil equivalent proved reserve about other individual property in the company portfolio of asset each contained between percent and percent of the company oil equivalent proved reserve which in the aggregate accounted for percent of the company total oil equivalent proved reserve these property were geographically dispersed located in the united state canada south america africa asia and australia in the united state total proved reserve at year end were billion boe california property accounted for percent of the reserve with most classified heavy oil because of heavy oil high viscosity and the need to employ enhanced recovery method most of the company heavy oil field in california employ continuous steamflooding process the gulf of mexico region contains percent of the reserve and production operation are mostly offshore other area represent the remaining percent of reserve for production of crude oil some field utilize enhanced recovery method including waterflooding and injection for the three year ending december the pattern of netreserve change shown in the following table are not necessarily indicative of future
