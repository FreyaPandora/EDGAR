could adversely affect our business financial condition result of operation cash flow and the trading price of our common stock strategic and competitive risk we face intense competition across all market for our product and service which may lead to lower revenue or operating margin competition in the technology sector our competitor range in size from diversified global company with significant research and development resource to small specialized firm whose narrower product line may let them be more effective in deploying technical marketing and financial resource barrier to entry in many of our business are low and many of the area in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technology shifting user need and frequent introduction of new product and service our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative product device and service that appeal to business and consumer competition among platform based ecosystem an important element of our business model ha been to create platform based ecosystem on which many participant can build diverse solution well established ecosystem creates beneficial network effect among user application developer and the platform provider that can accelerate growth establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margin we face significant competition from firm that provide competing platform competing vertically integrated model in which single firm control the software and hardware element of product and related service ha succeeded with some consumer product such personal computer tablet phone gaming console wearable and other endpoint device competitor pursuing this model also earn revenue from service integrated with the hardware and software platform including application and content sold through their integrated marketplace they may also be able to claim security and performance benefit from their vertically integrated offer we also offer some vertically integrated hardware and software product and service to the extent we shift portion of our business to vertically integrated model we increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margin we derive substantial revenue from license of window operating system on pc we face significant competition from competing platform developed for new device and form factor such smartphones and tablet computer these device compete on multiple base including price and the perceived utility of the device and it platform user are increasingly turning to these device to perform function that in the past were performed by personal computer even if many user view these device complementary to personal computer the prevalence of these device may make it more difficult to attract application developer to our pc operating system platform competing with operating system licensed at low or no cost may decrease our pc operating system margin popular product or service offered on competing platform could increase their competitive strength in addition some of our device compete with product made by our original equipment manufacturer oem partner which may affect their commitment to our platform competing platform have content and application marketplace with scale and significant installed base the variety and utility of content and application available on platform are important to device purchasing decision user may incur cost to move data and buy new content and application when switching platform to compete we must successfully enlist developer to write application for our platform and ensure that these application have high quality security customer appeal and value effort to compete with competitor content and application marketplace may increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margin competitor rule governing their content and application marketplace may restrict our ability to distribute product and service through them in accordance with our technical and business model objective part item business model competition company compete with based on growing variety of business model even we transition more of our business to infrastructure platform and software service business model the license based proprietary software model generates substantial portion of our software revenue we bear the cost of converting original idea into software product through investment in research and development offsetting these cost with the revenue received from licensing our product many of our competitor also develop and sell software to business and consumer under this model other competitor develop and offer free application online service and content and make money by selling third party advertising advertising revenue fund development of product and service these competitor provide to user at no or little cost competing directly with our revenue generating product some company compete with by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost to end user and earning revenue on advertising or integrated product and service these firm do not bear the full cost of research and development for the open source software some open source software mimic the feature and functionality of our product the competitive pressure described above may cause decreased sale volume price reduction and or increased operating cost such for research and development marketing and sale incentive this may lead to lower revenue gross margin and operating income our increasing focus on cloud based service present execution and competitive risk growing part of our business involves cloud based service available across the spectrum of computing device our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best in class platform and productivity service for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence ai at the time our competitor are rapidly developing and deploying cloud based service for consumer and business customer pricing and delivery model are evolving device and form factor influence how user access service in the cloud and sometimes the user choice of which cloud based service to use we are devoting significant resource to develop and deploy our cloud based strategy the window ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment we embrace cultural and organizational change to drive accountability and eliminate obstacle to innovation our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge worldview is connected with the growth of the internet of thing iot our success in the iot will depend on the level of adoption of our offering such azure azure stack azure iot edge and azure sphere we may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to achieve our business objective besides software development cost we are incurring cost to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing service these cost will reduce the operating margin we have previously achieved whether we succeed in cloud based service depends on our execution in several area including continuing to bring to market compelling cloud based experience that generate increasing traffic and market share maintaining the utility compatibility and performance of our cloud based service on the growing array of computing device including pc smartphones tablet gaming console and other device well sensor and other iot endpoint continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platform to third party developer ensuring our cloud based service meet the reliability expectation of our customer and maintain the security of their data well help them meet their own compliance need making our suite of cloud based service platform agnostic available on wide range of device and ecosystem including those of our competitor it is uncertain whether our strategy will attract the user or generate the revenue required to succeed if we are not effective in executing organizational and technical change to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new product and service we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investment described above this may negatively impact gross margin and operating income part item risk relating to the evolution of our business we make significant investment in product and service that may not achieve expected return we will continue to make significant investment in research development and marketing for existing product service and technology including the window operating system microsoft office bing sql server window server azure office xbox linkedin and other product and service we also invest in the development and acquisition of variety of hardware for productivity communication and entertainment including pc tablet gaming device and hololens investment in new technology are speculative commercial success depends on many factor including innovativeness developer support and effective distribution and marketing if customer do not perceive our latest offering providing significant new functionality or other value they may reduce their purchase of new software and hardware product or upgrade unfavorably affecting revenue we may not achieve significant revenue from new product service and distribution channel investment for several year if at all new product and service may not be profitable and even if they are profitable operating margin for some new product and business will not be high the margin we have experienced historically we may not get engagement in certain feature like edge and bing that drive post sale monetization opportunity our data handling practice across our product and service will continue to be under scrutiny and perception of mismanagement driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practice or product experience which could negatively impact product and feature adoption product design and product quality developing new technology is complex it can require long development and testing period significant delay in new release or significant problem in creating new product or service could adversely affect our revenue acquisition joint venture and strategic alliance may have an adverse effect on our business we expect to continue making acquisition and entering into joint venture and strategic alliance part of our long term business strategy for example in october we completed our acquisition of github inc github for billion in march we completed our acquisition of zenimax medium inc for billion and in april we announced definitive agreement to acquire nuance communication inc for billion these acquisition and other transaction and arrangement involve significant challenge and risk including that they do not advance our business strategy that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employee business system and technology that they distract management from our other business or that announced transaction may not be completed if an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstance and interest of party it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement the success of these transaction and arrangement will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing product and service or develop compelling new one it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefit from these transaction and arrangement such increased revenue or enhanced efficiency or the benefit may ultimately be smaller than we expected these event could adversely affect our consolidated financial statement if our goodwill or amortizable intangible asset become impaired we may be required to record significant charge to earnings we acquire other company and intangible asset and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisition which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangible we review our amortizable intangible asset for impairment when event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we test goodwill for impairment at least annually factor that may be change in circumstance indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible asset may not be recoverable include decline in our stock price and market capitalization reduced future cash flow estimate and slower growth rate in industry segment in which we participate we have in the past recorded and may in the future be required to record significant charge in our consolidated financial statement during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible asset is determined negatively affecting our result of operation part item cybersecurity data privacy and platform abuse risk cyberattacks and security vulnerability could lead to reduced revenue increased cost liability claim or harm to our reputation or competitive position security of our information technology threat to it security can take variety of form individual and group of hacker and sophisticated organization including state sponsored organization or nation state continuously undertake attack that pose threat to our customer and our it these actor may use wide variety of method which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerability in hardware software or other infrastructure in order to attack our product and service or gain access to our network and datacenters using social engineering technique to induce our employee user partner or customer to disclose password or other sensitive information or take other action to gain access to our data or our user or customer data or acting in coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attack nation state and state sponsored actor can deploy significant resource to plan and carry out exploit inadequate account security practice may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data for example system administrator may fail to timely remove employee account access when no longer appropriate employee or third party may intentionally compromise our or our user security or system or reveal confidential information malicious actor may employ the it supply chain to introduce malware through software update or compromised supplier account or hardware cyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them we may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerability which may allow them to persist in the environment over long period of time cyberthreats can have cascading impact that unfold with increasing speed across our internal network and system and those of our partner and customer breach of our facility network or data security could disrupt the security of our system and business application impair our ability to provide service to our customer and protect the privacy of their data result in product development delay compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other asset require to allocate more resource to improve technology or remediate the impact of attack or otherwise adversely affect our business the cyberattacks uncovered in late known solorigate or nobelium are an example of supply chain attack where malware wa introduced to software provider customer including through software update the attacker were later able to create false credential that appeared legitimate to certain customer system we may be target of further attack similar to solorigate nobelium both supplier and consumer of it in addition our internal it environment continues to evolve often we are early adopter of new device and technology we embrace new way of sharing data and communicating internally and with partner and customer using method such social networking and other consumer oriented technology our business policy and internal security control may not keep pace with these change new threat emerge part item security of our product service device and customer data the security of our product and service is important in our customer decision to purchase or use our product or service across cloud and on premise environment security threat are significant challenge to company like whose business is providing technology product and service to others threat to our own it infrastructure can also affect our customer customer using our cloud based service rely on the security of our infrastructure including hardware and other element provided by third party to ensure the reliability of our service and the protection of their data adversary tend to focus their effort on the most popular operating system program and service including many of and we expect that to continue in addition adversary can attack our customer on premise or cloud environment sometimes exploiting previously unknown zero day vulnerability such occurred in early calendar year with several of our exchange server on premise product vulnerability in these or any product can persist even after we have issued security patch if customer have not installed the most recent update or if the attacker exploited the vulnerability before patching to install additional malware to further compromise customer system adversary will continue to attack customer using our cloud service customer embrace digital transformation adversary that acquire user account information can use that information to compromise our user account including where account share the same attribute password inadequate account security practice may also result in unauthorized access and user activity may result in ransomware or other malicious software impacting customer use of our product or service we are increasingly incorporating open source software into our product there may be vulnerability in open source software that may make our product susceptible to cyberattacks our customer operate complex it system with third party hardware and software from multiple vendor that may include system acquired over many year they expect our product and service to support all these system and product including those that no longer incorporate the strongest current security advance or standard result we may not be able to discontinue support in our service for product service standard or feature solely because more secure alternative is available failure to utilize the most current security advance and standard can increase our customer vulnerability to attack further customer of widely varied size and technical sophistication use our technology and consequently may have limited capability and resource to help them adopt and implement state of the art cybersecurity practice and technology in addition we must account for this wide variation of technical sophistication when defining default setting for our product and service including security default setting these setting may limit or otherwise impact other aspect of it operation and some customer may have limited capability to review and reset these default the solorigate nobelium or similar cyberattacks may adversely impact our customer even if our production service are not directly compromised we are committed to notifying our customer whose system have been impacted we become aware and have available information and action for customer to help protect themselves we are also committed to providing guidance and support on detection tracking and remediation we may not be able to detect the existence or extent of these attack for all of our customer or have information on how to detect or track an attack especially where an attack involves on premise software such exchange server where we may have no or limited visibility into our customer computing environment development and deployment of defensive measure to defend against security threat to our internal it system our cloud based service and our customer system we must continuously engineer more secure product and service enhance security and reliability feature improve the deployment of software update to address security vulnerability in our own product well those provided by others develop mitigation technology that help to secure customer from attack even when software update are not deployed maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network product and service and provide security tool such firewall anti virus software and advanced security and information about the need to deploy security measure and the impact of so customer in certain industry such financial service health care and government may have enhanced or specialized requirement to which we must engineer our product and service part item the cost of measure to protect product and customer facing service could reduce our operating margin if we fail to do these thing well actual or perceived security vulnerability in our product and service data corruption issue or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customer to reduce or delay future purchase of product or subscription to service or to use competing product or service customer may also spend more on protecting their existing computer system from attack which could delay adoption of additional product or service customer and third party granted access to their system may fail to update their system continue to run software or operating system we no longer support or may fail timely to install or enable security patch or may otherwise fail to adopt adequate security practice any of these could adversely affect our reputation and revenue actual or perceived vulnerability may lead to claim against our license agreement typically contain provision that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability but there is no assurance these provision will withstand legal challenge at time to achieve commercial objective we may enter into agreement with larger liability exposure to customer our product operate in conjunction with and are dependent on product and component across broad ecosystem of third party if there is security vulnerability in one of these component and if there is security exploit targeting it we could face increased cost liability claim reduced revenue or harm to our reputation or competitive position disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloud based offering we store and process increasingly large amount of personally identifiable information of our customer and user the continued occurrence of high profile data breach provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security despite our effort to improve the security control across our business group and geography it is possible our security control over personal data our training of employee and third party on data security and other practice we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendor store and manage in addition third party who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized way improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation lead to legal exposure to customer or user or subject to liability under law that protect personal data resulting in increased cost or loss of revenue our software product and service also enable our customer and user to store and process personal data on premise or increasingly in cloud based environment we host government authority can sometimes require to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal order in the and elsewhere we advocate for transparency concerning these request and appropriate limitation on government authority to compel disclosure despite our effort to protect customer and user data perception that the collection use and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sale of our product or service and could limit adoption of our cloud based solution by consumer business and government entity additional security measure we may take to address customer or user concern or constraint on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectation or governmental rule or action may cause higher operating expense or hinder growth of our product and service we may not be able to protect information in our product and service

jurisdiction also allow competitor or consumer to assert claim of anti competitive conduct federal and state antitrust authority have previously brought enforcement action and continue to scrutinize our business the european commission the commission closely scrutinizes the design of high volume microsoft product and the term on which we make certain technology used in these product such file format programming interface and protocol available to other company flagship product release such window can receive significant scrutiny under competition law for example in the commission ordered to create new version of our window operating system that do not include certain multimedia technology and to provide our competitor with specification for how to implement certain proprietary window communication protocol in their own product in the commission accepted set of commitment we offered to address the commission concern relating to competition in web browsing software including an undertaking to address commission concern relating to interoperability the web browsing commitment expired in the remaining obligation may limit our ability to innovate in window or other product in the future diminish the developer appeal of the window platform and increase our product development cost the availability of license related to protocol and file format may enable competitor to develop software product that better mimic the functionality of our product which could hamper sale of our product our portfolio of first party device continues to grow at the same time our oem partner offer large variety of device for our platform result increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our oem partner creating risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rule regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase certain foreign government particularly in china and other country in asia have advanced argument under their competition law that exert downward pressure on royalty for our intellectual property government regulatory action and court decision such these may result in fine or hinder our ability to provide the benefit of our software to consumer and business reducing the attractiveness of our product and the revenue that come from them new competition law action could be initiated potentially using previous action precedent the outcome of such action or step taken to avoid them could adversely affect in variety of way including we may have to choose between withdrawing product from certain geography to avoid fine or designing and developing alternative version of those product to comply with government ruling which may entail delay in product release and removing functionality that customer want or on which developer rely part item we may be required to make available license to our proprietary technology on term that do not reflect their fair market value or do not protect our associated intellectual property we are subject to variety of ongoing commitment because of court or administrative order consent decree or other voluntary action we have taken if we fail to comply with these commitment we may incur litigation cost and be subject to substantial fine or other remedial action our ability to realize anticipated window post sale monetization opportunity may be limited our global operation subject to potential consequence under anti corruption trade and other law and regulation the foreign corrupt practice act fcpa and other anti corruption law and regulation anti corruption law prohibit corrupt payment by our employee vendor or agent and the accounting provision of the fcpa require to maintain accurate book and record and adequate internal control from time to time we receive inquiry from authority in the and elsewhere which may be based on report from employee and others about our business activity outside the and our compliance with anti corruption law periodically we receive such report directly and investigate them on july our hungarian subsidiary entered into non prosecution agreement npa with the department of justice doj and we agreed to the term of cease and desist order with the security and exchange commission these agreement required to pay million in monetary penalty disgorgement and interest pertaining to activity at microsoft subsidiary in hungary the npa which ha three year term also contains certain ongoing compliance requirement including the obligation to disclose to the doj issue that may implicate the fcpa and to cooperate in any inquiry most country in which we operate also have competition law that prohibit competitor from colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves while we devote substantial resource to our and international compliance program and have implemented policy training and internal control designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payment and collusive activity our employee vendor or agent may violate our policy our failure to comply with anti corruption law or competition law could result in significant fine and penalty criminal sanction against our officer or our employee prohibition on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation increasing trade law policy sanction and other regulatory requirement also affect our operation in and outside the relating to trade and investment economic sanction in the the eu and other country prohibit most business with restricted entity or country such crimea cuba iran north korea and syria export control restrict microsoft from offering many of it product and service to or making investment in certain entity in specified country import control restrict from integrating certain information and communication technology into our supply chain and allow for government review of transaction involving information and communication technology from country determined to be foreign adversary non compliance could result in reputational harm operational delay monetary fine loss of export privilege or criminal sanction other regulatory area that may apply to our product and online service offering include requirement related to user privacy telecommunication data storage and protection advertising and online content for example some regulator are taking the position that our offering such microsoft team and skype are covered by existing law regulating telecommunication service and some new law including eu member state law under the european electronic communication code are defining more of our service regulated telecommunication service this trend may continue and will result in these offering being subjected to additional data protection security and law enforcement surveillance obligation regulator may assert that our collection use and management of customer and other data is inconsistent with their law and regulation legislative or regulatory action relating to cybersecurity requirement may increase the cost to develop implement or secure our product and service legislative and regulatory action is emerging in the area of ai and content moderation which could increase cost or restrict opportunity applying these law and regulation to our business is often unclear subject to change over time and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction additionally these law and government approach to their enforcement and our product and service are continuing to evolve compliance with these type of regulation may involve significant cost or require change in product or business practice that result in reduced revenue noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalty or order we stop the alleged noncompliant activity we strive to empower all people and organization to achieve more and accessibility of our product is an important aspect of this goal there is increasing pressure from advocacy group regulator competitor customer and other stakeholder to make technology more accessible if our product do not meet customer expectation or global accessibility requirement we could lose sale opportunity or face regulatory or legal action part item law and regulation relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our service or result in increased cost legal claim fine against or reputational damage the growth of our internet and cloud based service internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundary legal requirement relating to the collection storage handling and transfer of personal data continue to evolve for example in july the court of justice of the eu invalidated framework called privacy shield for company to transfer data from eu member state to the united state this ruling ha led to uncertainty about the legal requirement for data transfer from the eu under other legal mechanism potential new rule and restriction on the flow of data across border could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our product and service in some market in may the eu general data protection regulation gdpr became effective the law which applies to all of our activity conducted from an establishment in the eu or related to product and service offered in the eu imposes range of compliance obligation regarding the handling of personal data engineering effort to build and maintain capability to facilitate compliance with the law have entailed substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resource from other project and may continue to do so we might experience reduced demand for our offering if we are unable to engineer product that meet our legal duty or help our customer meet their obligation under the gdpr or other data regulation or if our implementation to comply with the gdpr make our offering le attractive the gdpr imposes significant new obligation and compliance with these obligation depends in part on how particular regulator interpret and apply them if we fail to comply with the gdpr or if regulator assert we have failed to comply with the gdpr it may lead to regulatory enforcement action which can result in monetary penalty of up to of worldwide revenue private lawsuit reputational damage and loss of customer country around the world and state in the such california colorado and virginia have adopted or are considering adopting or expanding law and regulation imposing obligation regarding the handling of personal data the company investment in gaining insight from data is becoming central to the value of the service we deliver to customer to our operational efficiency and key opportunity in monetization customer perception of quality and operational efficiency our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory development that impede realizing the expected return from this investment ongoing legal analysis review and inquiry by regulator of microsoft practice or relevant practice of other organization may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirement including data sovereignty and localization requirement affecting the location movement collection and use of our customer and internal employee data well the management of that data compliance with applicable law and regulation regarding personal data may require change in service business practice or internal system that result in increased cost lower revenue reduced efficiency or greater difficulty in competing with foreign based firm compliance with data regulation might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain feature and functionality in some jurisdiction where we operate failure to comply with existing or new rule may result in significant penalty or order to stop the alleged noncompliant activity well negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort we have claim and lawsuit against that may result in adverse outcome we are subject to variety of claim and lawsuit these claim may arise from wide variety of business practice and initiative including major new product release such window significant business transaction warranty or product claim and employment practice adverse outcome in some or all of these claim may result in significant monetary damage or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business the litigation and other claim are subject to inherent uncertainty and management view of these matter may change in the future material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statement could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable our business with government customer may present additional uncertainty we derive substantial revenue from government contract government contract generally can present risk and challenge not present in private commercial agreement for instance we may be subject to government audit and investigation relating to these contract we could be suspended or debarred governmental contractor we could incur civil and criminal fine and penalty and under certain circumstance contract may be rescinded some agreement may allow government to terminate without cause and provide for higher liability limit for certain loss some contract may be subject to periodic funding approval reduction or delay which could adversely impact public sector demand for our product and service these event could negatively impact our result of operation financial condition and reputation part item we may have additional tax liability we are subject to income tax in the and many foreign jurisdiction significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income tax in the course of our business there are many transaction and calculation where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain for example compliance with the united state tax cut and job act tcja and possible future legislative change may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the company the use of estimate in our consolidated financial statement and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for it provision regulation and guidance evolve with respect to the tcja or possible future legislative change and we gather more information and perform more analysis our result may differ from previous estimate and may materially affect our consolidated financial statement we regularly are under audit by tax authority in different jurisdiction although we believe that our provision for income tax and our tax estimate are reasonable tax authority may disagree with certain position we have taken in addition economic and political pressure to increase tax revenue in various jurisdiction may make resolving tax dispute favorably more difficult we are currently under internal revenue service audit for prior tax year with the primary unresolved issue relating to transfer pricing the final resolution of those audit and other audit or litigation may differ from the amount recorded in our consolidated financial statement and may materially affect our consolidated financial statement in the period or period in which that determination is made we earn significant amount of our operating income outside the change in the mix of earnings and loss in country with differing statutory tax rate change in our business or structure or the expiration of or dispute about certain tax agreement in particular country may result in higher effective tax rate for the company in addition change in federal and state or international tax law applicable to corporate multinationals other fundamental law change currently being considered by many country including in the and change in taxing jurisdiction administrative interpretation decision policy and position may materially adversely impact our consolidated financial statement intellectual property risk we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure source code the detailed program command for our operating system and other software program is critical to our business although we license portion of our application and operating system source code to several licensee we take significant measure to protect the secrecy of large portion of our source code if our source code leak we might lose future trade secret protection for that code it may then become easier for third party to compete with our product by copying functionality which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margin unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risk described elsewhere in these risk factor legal change our evolving business model piracy and other factor may decrease the value of our intellectual property protecting our intellectual property right and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on global basis is difficult while piracy adversely affect revenue the impact on revenue from outside the is more significant particularly country in which the legal system provides le protection for intellectual property right our revenue in these market may grow more slowly than the underlying device market similarly the absence of harmonized patent law make it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent right throughout the world we educate user about the benefit of licensing genuine product and obtaining indemnification benefit for intellectual property risk and we educate lawmaker about the advantage of business climate where intellectual property right are protected reduction in the legal protection for software intellectual property right could adversely affect revenue we expend significant resource to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenue by incorporating that intellectual property in our product or service or in some instance by licensing or cross licensing our patent to others in return for royalty and or increased freedom to operate change in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patent these include legislative change and regulatory action that make it more difficult to obtain injunction and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patent similarly licensee of our patent may fail to satisfy their obligation to pay royalty or may contest the scope and extent of their obligation the royalty we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology price change in product using licensed patent greater value from cross licensing or the difficulty of discovering infringement finally our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause to license our intellectual property right broadly in certain situation and may negatively impact revenue part item third party may claim we infringe their intellectual property right from time to time others claim we infringe their intellectual property right the number of these claim may grow because of constant technological change in the market in which we compete the extensive patent coverage of existing technology the rapid rate of issuance of new patent and our offering of first party device such surface to resolve these claim we may enter into royalty and licensing agreement on term that are le favorable than currently available stop selling or redesign affected product or service or pay damage to satisfy indemnification commitment with our customer these outcome may cause operating margin to decline besides money damage in some jurisdiction plaintiff can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing marketing and selling our product or service that have infringing technology in some country such germany an injunction can be issued before the party have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patent we have paid significant amount to settle claim related to the use of technology and intellectual property right and to procure intellectual property right part of our strategy to manage this risk and may continue to do so general risk if our reputation or our brand are damaged our business and operating result may be harmed our reputation and brand are globally recognized and are important to our business our reputation and brand affect our ability to attract and retain consumer business and public sector customer there are numerous way our reputation or brand could be damaged these include product safety or quality issue or our environmental impact and sustainability supply chain

policy position damage to our reputation or our brand may occur from among other thing the introduction of new feature product service or term of service that customer user or partner do not like public scrutiny of our decision regarding user privacy data practice or content data security breach compliance failure or action of partner or individual employee the proliferation of social medium may increase the likelihood speed and magnitude of negative brand event if our brand or reputation are damaged it could negatively impact our revenue or margin or ability to attract the most highly qualified employee adverse economic or market condition may harm our business worsening economic condition including inflation recession pandemic or other change in economic condition may cause lower it spending and adversely affect our revenue if demand for pc server and other computing device decline or consumer or business spending for those product decline our revenue will be adversely affected our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network oems building device that run our software have also been significant mean of distribution the impact of economic condition on our partner such the bankruptcy of major distributor oem or retailer could cause sale channel disruption challenging economic condition also may impair the ability of our customer to pay for product and service they have purchased result allowance for doubtful account and write offs of account receivable may increase we maintain an investment portfolio of various holding type and maturity these investment are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risk which may be exacerbated by market downturn or event that affect global financial market significant part of our investment portfolio comprises government security if global financial market decline for long period or if there is downgrade of the government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investment have experienced decline in fair value requiring impairment charge that could adversely affect our consolidated financial statement part item catastrophic event or geopolitical condition may disrupt our business disruption or failure of our system

license is considered distinct and accounted for separately or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time certain cloud service primarily office depend on significant level of integration interdependency and interrelation between the desktop application and cloud service and are accounted for together one performance obligation revenue from office is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud service are provided judgment is required to determine the stand alone selling price ssp for each distinct performance obligation we use single amount to estimate ssp for item that are not sold separately including on premise license sold with sa or software update provided at no additional charge we use range of amount to estimate ssp when we sell each of the product and service separately and need to determine whether there is discount to be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various product and service in instance where ssp is not directly observable such when we do not sell the product or service separately we determine the ssp using information that may include market condition and other observable input we typically have more than one ssp for individual product and service due to the stratification of those product and service by customer and circumstance in these instance we may use information such the size of the

we review debt investment quarterly for credit loss and impairment if the cost of an investment exceeds it fair value we evaluate among other factor general market condition credit quality of debt instrument issuer and the extent to which the fair value is le than cost this determination requires significant judgment in making this judgment we employ systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investment in addition we consider specific adverse condition related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee if we have plan to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery then decline in fair value below cost is

part ii item equity investment without readily determinable fair value are written to fair value if qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the

once an investment is determined to be impaired an impairment charge is recorded in other income expense net goodwill we allocate goodwill to reporting unit based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination we evaluate our reporting unit on an annual basis and if necessary reassign goodwill using relative fair value allocation approach goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis may for and between annual test if an event occurs or circumstance change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of reporting unit below it carrying value these event or circumstance could include significant change in the business climate legal factor operating performance indicator competition or sale or disposition of significant portion of reporting unit application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting unit assignment of asset and liability to reporting unit assignment of goodwill to reporting unit and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of discounted cash flow methodology this analysis requires significant judgment including estimation of future cash flow which is dependent on internal forecast estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business estimation of the useful life over which cash flow will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital the estimate used to calculate the fair value of reporting unit change from year to year based on operating result market condition and other factor change in these estimate and assumption could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit research and development cost cost incurred internally in researching and developing computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility ha been established for the product once technological feasibility is established software cost are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customer judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of product is established we have determined that technological feasibility for our software product is reached after all high risk development issue have been resolved through coding and testing generally this occurs shortly before the product are released to production the

significant uncertainty an estimated loss from loss contingency such legal proceeding or claim is accrued by charge to income if it is probable that an asset ha been impaired or liability ha been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated in determining whether loss should be accrued we evaluate among other factor the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the

the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time certain cloud service primarily office depend on significant level of integration interdependency and interrelation between the desktop application and cloud service and are accounted for together one performance obligation revenue from office is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud service are provided part ii item judgment is required to determine the ssp for each distinct performance obligation we use single amount to estimate ssp for item that are not sold separately including on premise license sold with sa or software update provided at no additional charge we use range of amount to estimate ssp when we sell each of the product and service separately and need to determine whether there is discount to be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various product and service in instance where ssp is not directly observable such when we do not sell the product or service separately we determine the ssp using information that may include market condition and other observable input we typically have more than one ssp for individual product and service due to the stratification of those product and service by customer and circumstance in these instance we may use information such the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the ssp due to the various benefit from and the nature of our sa program judgment is required to ass the pattern of delivery including the exercise pattern of certain benefit across our portfolio of customer our product are generally sold with right of return we may provide other credit or incentive and in certain instance we estimate customer usage of our product and service which are accounted for variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize return and credit are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available change to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the period presented contract balance and other receivables timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customer we record receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing for multi year agreement we generally invoice customer annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period we record receivable related to revenue recognized for multi year on premise license we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those license unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing program which may include sa and cloud service unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi year agreement and recognized ratably

of payment within to day in instance where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing we have determined our contract generally do not include significant financing component the primary purpose of our invoicing term is to provide customer with simplified and predictable way of purchasing our product and service not to receive financing from our customer or to provide customer with financing example include invoicing at the beginning of subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period and multi year on premise license that are

asset in our consolidated balance sheet we record an allowance to cover expected loss based on troubled account historical experience and other currently available evidence asset recognized from cost to obtain contract with customer we recognize an asset for the incremental cost of obtaining contract with customer if we expect the benefit of those cost to be longer than one year we have determined that certain sale incentive program meet the requirement to be capitalized total capitalized cost to obtain contract were immaterial during the period presented and are included in other current and long term asset in our consolidated balance sheet we apply practical expedient to expense cost incurred for cost to obtain contract with customer when the amortization period would have been one year

software development cost capitalized software development cost are amortized over the estimated life of the product product warranty we provide for the estimated cost of fulfilling our obligation under hardware and software warranty at the time the related revenue is recognized for hardware warranty we estimate the cost based on historical and projected product failure rate historical and projected repair cost and knowledge of specific product failure if any the specific hardware warranty term and condition vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business but generally include part and labor over period generally ranging from day to three year for software warranty we estimate the cost to provide bug fix such security patch over the estimated life of the software we regularly reevaluate our estimate to ass the adequacy of the recorded warranty liability and adjust the amount necessary part ii item research and development research and development expense include payroll employee benefit stock based compensation expense and other headcount related expense associated with product development research and development expense also include third party development and programming cost localization cost incurred to translate software for international market and the amortization of purchased software code and service content such cost related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached which for our software product is generally shortly before the

compensation cost for stock award which include restricted stock unit rsus and performance stock unit psus is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized expense net of estimated forfeiture over the related service or performance period the fair value of stock award is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date le the present value of expected dividend not received during the vesting period we measure the fair value of psus using monte carlo valuation model compensation cost for rsus is recognized using the straight line method and for psus is recognized using the accelerated method compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan espp is measured the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase income tax income tax expense includes and international income tax and interest and penalty on uncertain tax position certain income and expense are not reported in tax return and financial statement in the same year the tax effect of such temporary difference is reported deferred income tax deferred tax asset are reported net of valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that tax benefit will not be realized all deferred income tax are classified long term in our consolidated balance sheet financial instrument investment we consider all highly liquid interest earning investment with maturity of three month or le at the date of purchase to be cash equivalent the fair value of these investment approximate their carrying value in general investment with original maturity of greater than three month and remaining maturity of le than one year are classified short term investment investment with maturity beyond one year may be classified short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable security represent the investment of cash that is available for current operation part ii item debt investment are classified available for sale and realized gain and loss are recorded using the specific identification method change in fair value excluding credit loss and impairment are recorded in other comprehensive income fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimate determined by management if the cost of an investment exceeds it fair value we evaluate among other factor general market condition credit quality of debt instrument issuer and the extent to which the fair value is le than cost to determine credit loss we employ systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in addition we consider specific adverse condition related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee if we have plan to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery then decline in fair value below cost is recorded an impairment charge in other income expense net and new cost basis in the investment is established if market industry and or investee condition deteriorate we may incur future impairment equity investment with readily determinable fair value are measured at fair value equity investment without readily determinable fair value are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustment for observable change in price or impairment referred to the measurement alternative we perform qualitative assessment on periodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicator that the fair value of the investment is le than carrying value change in value are recorded in other income expense net derivative derivative instrument are recognized either asset or liability and measured at fair value the accounting for change in the fair value of derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation for derivative instrument designated fair value hedge gain and loss are recognized in other income expense net with offsetting gain and loss on the hedged item gain and loss representing hedge component excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income expense net for derivative instrument designated cash flow hedge gain and loss are initially reported component of other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in earnings with the corresponding hedged item gain and loss representing hedge component excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in earnings for derivative instrument that are not designated hedge gain and loss from change in fair value are primarily recognized in other income expense net fair value measurement we account for certain asset and liability at fair value the hierarchy below list three level of fair value based on the extent to which input used in measuring fair value are observable in the market we categorize each of our fair value measurement in one of these three level based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in it entirety these level are level input are based upon unadjusted quoted price for identical instrument in active market our level investment include government security common and preferred stock and mutual fund our level derivative asset and liability include those actively traded on exchange level input are based upon quoted price for similar instrument in active market quoted price for identical or similar instrument in market that are not active and model based valuation technique the black scholes model for which all significant input are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability where applicable these model project future cash flow and discount the future amount to present value using market based observable input including interest rate curve credit spread foreign exchange rate and forward and spot price for currency our level investment include commercial paper certificate of deposit agency security foreign government bond mortgage and asset backed security corporate note and bond and municipal security our level derivative asset and liability primarily include certain over the counter option and swap contract part ii item level input are generally unobservable and typically reflect management estimate of assumption that market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability the fair value are therefore determined using model based technique including option pricing model and discounted cash flow model our level asset and liability include investment in corporate note and bond municipal security and goodwill and intangible asset when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge unobservable input used in the model are significant to the fair value of the asset and liability we measure equity investment without readily determinable fair value on nonrecurring basis the fair value of these investment are determined based on valuation technique using the best information available and may include quoted market price market comparables and discounted cash flow projection our other current financial asset and current financial liability have fair value that approximate their carrying value inventory inventory are stated at average cost subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value cost includes material labor and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventory net realizable value is the estimated selling price le estimated cost of completion disposal and transportation we regularly review inventory quantity on hand future purchase commitment with our supplier and the estimated utility of our inventory if our review indicates reduction in utility below carrying value we reduce our inventory to new cost basis through charge to cost of revenue property and equipment property and equipment is stated at cost le accumulated depreciation and depreciated using the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term the estimated useful life of our property and

long term liability in our consolidated balance sheet rou asset represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liability represent our obligation to make lease payment arising from the lease operating lease rou asset and liability are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payment over the lease term most of our lease do not provide an implicit rate we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over similar term of the lease payment at commencement date the operating lease rou asset also includes any lease payment made and excludes lease incentive our lease term may include option to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option lease expense for lease payment is recognized on straight line basis over the lease term we have lease agreement with lease and non lease component which are generally accounted for separately for certain equipment lease such vehicle we account for the lease and non lease component single lease component additionally for certain equipment lease we apply portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease rou asset and liability goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis may for and between annual test if an event occurs or circumstance change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of reporting unit below it carrying value part ii item intangible asset our intangible asset are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated period of benefit ranging from one to year we evaluate the recoverability of intangible asset periodically by taking into account event or circumstance that may warrant revised estimate of useful life or that indicate the asset may be impaired recent accounting guidance recently adopted accounting guidance financial instrument credit loss in june the fasb issued new standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current gaap with methodology that reflects expected credit loss and requires consideration of broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimate we adopted the standard effective july we use forward looking expected credit loss model for account receivable loan and other financial instrument credit loss relating to available for sale debt security are recorded through an allowance for credit loss rather than reduction in the amortized cost basis of the security we applied modified retrospective approach through cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of the effective date to align our credit loss methodology with the new standard the adoption of the standard did not have material impact on our consolidated financial statement recent accounting guidance not yet adopted accounting for income tax in december the fasb issued new standard to simplify the accounting for income tax the guidance eliminates certain exception related to
