ambition our employee customer community and shareholder all win engineer we are fortunate to work on exciting technology which help our customer innovate to create better world technology is the foundation of our company ultimately our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate long term value for owner is the growth of free cash flow per share our strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth ha three element the first element of our strategy is business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing product and built around four competitive advantage this business model is the result of series of strategic decision made over the year and that continue today the four sustainable competitive advantage are strong foundation of manufacturing and technology broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing product the reach of our market channel and diversity and longevity of our product market and customer position in combination these four competitive advantage provide tangible benefit are difficult to replicate and ultimately separate from our best peer together these competitive advantage help position ti in unique class of company capable of generating and returning significant amount of cash for our owner we make our investment with an eye towards long term strengthening and leveraging of these advantage the second element of our strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth is disciplined allocation of capital this span we select project develop new capability like ti com invest in new manufacturing capacity or how we think acquisition and returning cash to our owner over year period from to we allocated billion which reinforces the importance of discipline in capital allocation the largest allocation over this period wa to drive organic growth which includes investment in sale and marketing capital expenditure and working capital for inventory beyond that we also allocated capital to dividend and share repurchase dividend are designed to appeal to broad set of investor and share repurchase are made with the goal of the accretive capture of future free cash flow for long term investor lastly we allocate to acquisition for inorganic growth which we last in when we acquired national semiconductor the third element of our strategy is efficiency which we think of constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent this is about getting our investment in the impactful area to maximize the growth of long term free cash flow per share is not about optimizing cost cutting to get to the last dollar of expense we bring this philosophy of efficiency and continuous improvement to all area of the company and this focus on efficiency contributes to revenue growth improved gross margin disciplined and sg expense free cash flow margin and ultimately to free cash flow per share growth we believe that our business model with the combined effect of our four competitive advantage set ti apart from our peer and will for long time to come we will invest to strengthen our competitive advantage be disciplined in capital allocation and stay diligent in our pursuit of efficiency finally we will remain focused on the belief that long term growth of free cash flow per share is the ultimate measure to generate value informationsemiconductors are electronic

calculator and other of ti revenue characteristicscompetitive landscapedespite recent consolidation the analog and embedded processing market remain highly fragmented result we face significant global competition from dozen of large and small company including broad based supplier and niche supplier our competitor also include emerging company particularly in asia we believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factor including the breadth of company product line the strength and reach of it channel to market technological innovation product development execution technical support customer service quality reliability price and manufacturing capacity and capability in addition manufacturing process and package technology that provide differentiated level of performance and structural cost advantage are competitive factor for our analog product and customer prior investment in software development is competitive factor for our embedded processing product market cyclethe semiconductor cycle refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand and the building and depleting of inventory the semiconductor market historically ha been characterized by period of tight supply caused by strengthening demand and or insufficient manufacturing capacity followed by period of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand and or excess manufacturing capacity these are typically referred to upturn and downturn in the semiconductor cycle semiconductor cycle could be affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facility we employ several strategy which have many benefit including dampening the effect of the semiconductor cycle on ti an example we are focused on building closer direct relationship with customer when it come to market cycle these relationship provide improved insight into customer demand and allow to more accurately and efficiently manage factory loading and inventory level which lead to more stable lead time and higher product availability finally we focus our resource on analog and embedded processing product and industrial and automotive market generally our product serve large and diverse customer base which reduces our dependence on the performance of any single product market or customer in addition they typically have long shelf life and low risk of obsolescence industrial and automotive market also benefit from long product life cycle with revenue often lasting year or more which help to smooth the impact of cyclicality seasonalityour revenue is subject to seasonal variation historically our sequential revenue growth rate tends to be weaker in the first and fourth quarter when compared with the second and third quarter customer sale and distributionwe sell our product to over customer our customer base is diverse with more than one third of our revenue derived from customer outside our largest we market and sell our product through direct sale channel including our website and broad sale and application team and through distributor over the past several year we have been investing in new capability and evolving our distribution network to better align with our strategy to establish closer direct relationship with our customer with le business flowing through the distribution channel we require fewer distributor during we completed our transition to single worldwide distributor coupled with region specific distributor for order fulfillment building closer direct customer relationship strengthens our reach of market channel advantage which give access to more customer and more of their design project leading to the opportunity to sell more of our product into each design additionally broader and deeper access give better insight and knowledge of customer need our investment in new and improved capability to directly support our customer include website and commerce enhancement well inventory consignment program and order fulfillment service manufacturing begin with sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing step that fabricate number of semiconductor device on thin silicon wafer each device on the wafer is packaged and tested the entire process take place in highly specialized facility that require substantial investment we own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facility in north america asia japan and europe these include both wafer fabrication and assembly test facility we invest in manufacturing technology and do most of our manufacturing in house this strategic decision to make manufacturing and technology core competitive advantage delivers tangible benefit of lower manufacturing cost and greater control of our supply chain we have focused on creating competitive manufacturing structural cost advantage by investing in our advanced analog millimeter capacity an unpackaged chip built on millimeter wafer cost about le than an unpackaged chip built on millimeter wafer to strengthen this advantage construction is underway on our new millimeter wafer fabrication facility in richardson texas millimeter wafer will continue to support the majority of our analog growth we ass and are careful to address potential health safety and environmental risk presented by our operation including our manufacturing operation we care for our environment and work to prevent pollution and the potential risk related to climate change by implementing practice such recycling and reusing material controlling harmful emission and properly handling hazardous and restricted substance we expect to continue to maintain sufficient internal manufacturing capacity to meet the majority of our production need and to obtain manufacturing equipment to support new technology development and revenue growth to supplement our manufacturing capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand we selectively use the capacity of outside supplier commonly known foundry and subcontractor in we sourced about of our total wafer from external foundry and about of our assembly test service from subcontractor inventory our objective for inventory are to maintain high level of customer service maintain stable and competitive lead time minimize inventory obsolescence and improve manufacturing asset utilization to meet these objective and to allow greater flexibility in period of high demand we build ahead of demand our broad based product that are used across diverse set of application and customer and have low risk of obsolescence inventory level will vary based on market condition and seasonality raw materialswe purchase material part and supply from number of supplier in some case we purchase such item from sole source supplier the material part and supply essential to our business are generally available present and we believe that such material part and supply will be available in the foreseeable future intellectual propertywe own many patent and have many patent application pending in the united state and other country in field relating to our business we have developed strong broad based patent

meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risk that apply to ti company with broad international operation like many company we are susceptible to potential downturn associated with macroeconomic weakness which may affect our performance and the performance of our customer similarly the price of our security is subject to volatility due to fluctuation in general market condition actual financial result that do not meet our and or the investment community expectation change in our and or the investment community expectation for our future result dividend or share repurchase and other factor many of which are beyond our control risk related to our business and industrythe extent to which the covid pandemic will adversely affect our business result of operation and financial condition is uncertain the global spread of the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus sars cov and the coronavirus disease covid ha created significant uncertainty and economic disruption both near term and potentially long term we have modified and might further modify our business practice in response to the covid pandemic related third party response including from government authority and our supplier customer and distributor and the economic and social ramification of the disease and societal response across the market in which ti operates the extent to which the covid pandemic will continue to affect our business result of operation and financial condition is difficult to predict and depends on numerous evolving factor including the duration and scope of the pandemic government social business and other action that have been and will be taken in response to the pandemic and the effect of the pandemic on short and long term general economic condition we might experience short or long term constrained supply or volatility in customer demand which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial result in future period our global operation subject to risk associated with domestic or international political social economic or other condition we have facility in more than country about of our revenue come from shipment to location outside the united state shipment of product to china based customer represent about of our revenue certain country we operate have experienced and other country may experience trade tension that affect global trade and macroeconomic condition through the enactment of tariff import or export restriction trade embargo and sanction restriction on cross border investment and other trade barrier trade tension impact our ability to deliver product and product support into china cause chinese customer to seek alternate supplier and could otherwise adversely affect our operation and financial result we are exposed to political social and economic condition security risk terrorism or other hostile act health condition and epidemic labor condition and possible disruption in transportation communication and information technology network of the various country in which we operate in addition our global operation expose to period when the dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non currency in which we transact business the remeasurement of non dollar transaction can have an adverse effect on our result of operation and financial condition we face substantial competition that requires to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressure we face intense technological and pricing competition in the market in which we operate we expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitor and from small competitor serving niche market and also from emerging company particularly in asia that sell product into the market in which we operate for example we may face increased competition result of china actively promoting and reshaping it domestic semiconductor industry through policy change and investment these action in conjunction with trade tension may restrict from participating in the china market or may prevent from competing effectively certain competitor posse sufficient financial technical and management resource to develop and market product that may compete favorably our product and consolidation among our competitor may allow them to compete more effectively the price and product development pressure that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margin and lost business opportunity in the event that we are unable to match the price decline or cost efficiency or meet the technological product support software or manufacturing advancement of our competitor in expected demand for our product could have material adverse effect on our result of operation our customer include company in wide range of end market and sector within those market if demand in one or more sector within our end market decline or the rate of growth slows our result of operation may be adversely affected the cyclical nature of the semiconductor market occasionally lead to significant and rapid increase and decrease in product demand additionally the loss or significant curtailment of purchase by one or more of our large customer including curtailment due to change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policy or practice of these customer the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustment change in demand for customer product or trade restriction may adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition our result of operation also might suffer because of general decline in customer demand resulting from for example uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial market natural event epidemic or domestic or international political social economic or other condition breach of customer information technology system that disrupt customer operation or customer inability to access credit market and other source of needed liquidity our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill order may affect our ability to meet quarter revenue forecast we manufacture product based on forecast of customer demand these forecast are based on multiple assumption and if inaccurate could cause to hold inadequate excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margin and adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition our operating result and our reputation could be adversely affected by breach disruption or other incident relating to our information technology system breach disruption or other incident relating to our information technology system or the system of our customer vendor and other third party could be caused by factor such computer virus system failure restricted network access unauthorized access terrorism employee malfeasance or human error these event could among other thing compromise our information technology network result in corrupt or lost data or the unauthorized release of our our customer or our supplier confidential or proprietary information cause disruption to our manufacturing and other operation result in the release of personal data or cause to incur cost associated with increased protection remediation regulatory inquiry or penalty or claim for damage any of which could adversely affect our operating result and our reputation cybersecurity or other threat to our information technology system or the system of our customer vendor and other third party are frequent and constantly evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of defending against them our ability to successfully implement strategic business and organizational change could affect our business plan and result of operation from time to time we undertake strategic business and organizational change including acquisition divestiture and restructuring action to support or carry our objective if we do not successfully implement these change our business plan and operating result could be adversely affected we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth cost saving or other benefit of strategic business and organizational change and charge associated with these action could differ materially in amount and timing from our expectation our result of operation could be affected by natural event in the location in which we operate we have manufacturing data and design facility and other operation in location subject to natural occurrence such severe weather geological event or epidemic that could disrupt operation natural disaster that result in prolonged disruption particularly where we have principal manufacturing and design operation listed in the property section in item may adversely affect our result and financial condition rapid technological change in market we serve requires to develop new technology and product rapid technological change in market we serve could contribute to shortened product life cycle and decline in average selling price of our product our result of operation depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop manufacture and market innovative product in timely and cost effective manner we make significant investment in research and development to improve existing technology and product develop new product to meet changing customer demand and improve our production process in some case we might not realize return or the expected return on our investment because they are generally made commercial viability can be assured further project that are commercially viable may not contribute to our operating result until at least few year after they are completed face supply chain and manufacturing risk we rely on third party to supply with good and service in cost effective and timely manner our access to needed good and service may be adversely affected by potential dispute with supplier or disruption in our supplier operation result of for example quality excursion uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial market domestic or international political social economic and other condition natural event or epidemic in the location in which our supplier operate or limited or delayed access to key raw material natural resource and utility additionally breach or other incident relating to our supplier information technology system could result in release of confidential or proprietary information if our supplier are unable to access credit market and other source of needed liquidity we may be unable to obtain needed supply collect account receivable or access needed technology in particular our manufacturing process and critical manufacturing equipment require that certain key raw material natural resource and utility be available limited or delayed access to and high cost of these item could adversely affect our result of operation our product contain material that are subject to conflict mineral reporting requirement our relationship with customer and supplier may be adversely affected if we are unable to describe our product conflict free additionally our cost may increase if one or more of our customer demand that we change the sourcing of material we can not identify conflict free our inability to timely implement new manufacturing technology or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our result of operation we subcontract portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our product and we depend on third party to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development we do not have long term contract with all of these supplier and the number of alternate supplier is limited reliance on these supplier involves risk including possible shortage of capacity in period of high demand supplier inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in timely cost effective and appropriate manner the possibility of supplier imposition of increased cost on and the unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property our result of operation and our reputation could be affected by warranty claim product liability claim product recall or legal proceeding claim based on warranty product liability epidemic or delivery failure or other ground relating to our product manufacturing service design communication or cybersecurity could lead to significant expense we defend the claim or pay damage award or settlement in the event of claim we would also incur cost if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer any such claim may also cause to write the value of related inventory we maintain product liability insurance but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claim in addition it is possible for customer to recall product containing ti part for example with respect to product used in automotive application or handheld electronics which may cause to incur cost and expense relating to the recall any of these event could adversely affect our result of operation financial condition and reputation our result of operation and financial condition could be adversely affected if customer or distributor suffers loss with respect to our inventory we have consignment inventory program in place for some of our largest customer and distributor if customer or distributor were to experience loss with respect to ti consigned inventory our result of operation and financial condition would be adversely affected if we do not recover the full value of the lost inventory from the customer distributor or insurer or if our recovery is delayed our result of operation could be adversely affected by distributor promotion of competing product line or our distributor financial performance in about half of our revenue wa generated from sale of our product through distributor our distributor carry competing product line and our sale could be affected if semiconductor distributor promote competing product over our product moreover our result of operation could be affected if our distributor suffer financial difficulty that result in their inability to pay amount owed to dispute with current or former distributor could be disruptive or harmful to our business margin vary our profit margin vary due to number of factor which may include customer demand and shipment volume our manufacturing process product mix inventory level tariff freight cost and new accounting pronouncement or change in existing accounting practice or standard in addition we operate in highly competitive market environment that might adversely affect pricing for our product because we own much of our manufacturing capacity significant portion of our operating cost is fixed in general these fixed cost do not decline with reduction in customer demand or factory loading and can adversely affect profit margin result our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit sufficient number of qualified employee in competitive environment our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel well the effective management of succession for key employee skilled and experienced personnel in our industry including engineering management marketing technical and staff personnel are in high demand and competition for their talent is intense there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key engineering management and technical personnel that we require to execute our business strategy our ability to recruit internationally or deploy employee to various location may be limited by immigration law legal and regulatory risksour operation could be affected by the complex law rule and regulation to which our business is subject we are subject to complex law rule and regulation affecting our domestic and international operation relating to for example the environment and climate change safety and health trade bribery and corruption financial reporting tax data privacy and protection labor and employment competition market access epidemic intellectual property ownership and infringement and the movement of currency compliance with these law rule and regulation may be onerous and expensive and could restrict our ability to manufacture or ship our product and operate our business if we do not comply or if we become subject to enforcement activity we could be subject to fine penalty or other legal liability furthermore should these law rule and regulation be amended or expanded or new one enacted we could incur materially greater compliance cost or restriction on our ability to manufacture our product and operate our business some of these complex law rule and regulation for example those related to environmental safety and health requirement may particularly affect in the jurisdiction in which we manufacture product especially if such law and regulation require the use of abatement equipment beyond we currently employ require the addition or elimination of raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing process or impose cost fee or reporting requirement on the direct or indirect use of energy natural resource or material or gas used or emitted into the environment in connection with the manufacture of our product substitute for prohibited raw material or process might not be available or might not be available at reasonable cost our result of operation could be affected by change in tax related matter we have facility in more than country and result are subject to taxation and audit by number of taxing authority tax rate vary among the jurisdiction in which we operate if our tax rate increase our result of operation could be adversely affected number of factor could cause our tax rate to increase including change in the jurisdiction in which our profit are earned and taxed change in the mix of profit from those jurisdiction change in available tax credit or deduction including for amount relating to stock compensation change in applicable tax rate change in tariff regulation or surcharge change in accounting principle or adverse resolution of audit by taxing authority we have deferred tax asset on our balance sheet change in applicable tax law and regulation or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax asset which could also affect our result of operation in addition we are subject to law and regulation in various jurisdiction that determine how much profit ha been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction these law and regulation can be complex and subject to interpretation change in these law and regulation including those that align with the organisation for economic cooperation and development base erosion and profit shifting recommendation could affect the location where we are deemed to earn income which could in turn affect our result of operation each quarter we forecast our tax expense based on our forecast of our performance for the year if that performance forecast change our forecasted tax expense will change performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property right and to maintain freedom of operation access to worldwide market

necessary intellectual property right or that we will be able to independently develop the technology software or know how necessary to conduct our business or that we can do without infringing the intellectual property right of others to the extent that we have to rely on technology from others for which license is required there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such license at all or on term we consider reasonable we directly and indirectly face infringement claim from third party including non practicing entity that have acquired patent to pursue enforcement action against other company we also face infringement claim where we or our customer make use or sell product and where the intellectual property law may be le established or le predictable these assertion whether or not of any merit expose to claim for damage and or injunction from third party well claim for indemnification by our customer in instance where we have contractual or other legal obligation to indemnify them against damage resulting from infringement claim we actively enforce and protect our own intellectual property right however our effort can not prevent all misappropriation or improper use of our protected technology and information including for example third party use of our patented or copyrighted technology or our trade secret in their product without the right to do so or third party sale of counterfeit product bearing our trademark the risk of unfair copying or cloning may impede our ability to sell our product the law of country where we operate may not protect

long term value for owner is the growth of free cash flow per share our strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth ha three element great business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing product and built around four sustainable competitive advantage the four sustainable competitive advantage are powerful in combination and provide tangible benefit strong foundation of manufacturing and technology that provides lower cost and greater control of our supply chain ii broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing product that offer more opportunity per customer and more value for our investment iii the reach of our market channel that give access to more customer and more of their design project leading to the opportunity to sell more of our product into each design and give better insight and knowledge of customer need iv diversity and longevity of our product market and customer position that provide le single point dependency and longer return on our investment together these competitive advantage help position ti in unique class of company capable of generating and returning significant amount of cash for our owner we make our investment with an eye towards long term strengthening and leveraging of these advantage discipline in allocating capital to the best opportunity this span how we select project develop new capability like ti com invest in new manufacturing capacity or how we think about acquisition and returning cash to our owner efficiency which mean constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent we believe that our business model with the combined effect of our four competitive advantage set ti apart from our peer and will for long time to come we will invest to strengthen our competitive advantage be disciplined in capital allocation and stay diligent in our pursuit of efficiency finally we will remain focused on the belief that long term growth of free cash flow per share is the ultimate measure

segment to simplify our business structure into our power and signal chain product line these change had no impact on our previously reported consolidated financial statement or on our reportable segment result see note to the financial statement for more information regarding our segment when we discus our result unless otherwise noted change in our revenue are attributable to change in customer demand which are evidenced by fluctuation in shipment volume new product do not tend to have significant impact on our revenue in any given period because we sell such large number of product from time to time our revenue and gross profit are affected by change in demand for higher priced or lower priced product which we refer to change in the mix of product shipped because we own much of our manufacturing capacity significant portion of our operating cost is fixed when factory loading decrease our fixed cost are spread over reduced output and absent other circumstance our profit margin decrease conversely factory loading increase our fixed cost are spread over increased output and absent other circumstance our profit margin increase increase and decrease in factory loading

factor like the potential of local manufacturing restriction on our factory we could experience constraint in fulfilling customer order in future period the coronavirus pandemic remains dynamic with uncertainty around it duration and broader impact we continue to monitor and ass the situation and address implication to our business supply chain and customer demand we have long had business continuity plan in place for unforeseeable situation like we have seen with covid additionally over the past several year we have invested in building inventory and expanding our global internally owned manufacturing footprint investing in these capability ha given flexibility such the ability to build product across multiple manufacturing site these investment have helped to minimize disruption but may not be sufficient to eliminate them result of operationsour strategic focus is on analog and embedded processing product sold into six end market industrial automotive personal electronics communication equipment enterprise system and other while all end market represent good opportunity we place additional strategic emphasis on designing and selling those product into the

and ratio based on that measure these are financial measure that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle in the united state gaap free cash flow wa calculated by subtracting capital expenditure from the most directly comparable gaap measure cash flow from operating activity also referred to cash flow from operation we believe that free cash flow and the associated ratio provide insight into our liquidity our cash generating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to shareholder well insight into our financial performance

annual operating tax rate non gaap term we use to describe the estimated annual effective tax rate gaap measure that by definition doe not include discrete tax item we believe the term annual

transition tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings operating lease deferred compensation plan total principal and related interest payment for our long term debt obligation including amount classified the current portion of long term debt includes payment for software license and contractual arrangement with supplier when there is fixed non cancellable payment schedule or when minimum payment are due with reduced delivery schedule excludes cancellable arrangement see note to the financial statement includes payment for the one time transition tax on our indefinitely reinvested earnings related to the enactment of the tax cut and job act includes minimum payment for leased facility and equipment and purchase of industrial gas under contract accounted for operating lease see note to the financial statement estimated payment for certain liability that existed of december excludes million of uncertain tax liability under asc well any planned future funding contribution to retirement benefit plan amount associated with uncertain tax liability have been excluded because of the difficulty in making reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority regarding future funding of retirement benefit plan we plan to contribute about million in but funding projection beyond are not practical to estimate due to the rule affecting tax deductible contribution and the impact from the plan asset performance interest rate and potential and non legislation critical accounting policiesour accounting policy are more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statement disclosed in note the preparation of consolidated financial statement in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimate and assumption about future event that affect the amount reported in the financial statement and accompanying note however based on fact and circumstance inherent in developing estimate and assumption management belief it is unlikely that applying other estimate and assumption would have material impact on the financial statement we consider the following accounting policy to be those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and that require higher degree of judgment income taxesin determining net income for financial statement purpose we must make certain estimate and judgment in the calculation of tax provision and the resultant tax liability and in the recoverability of deferred tax asset that arise from temporary difference between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense the ordinary course of global business there may be many transaction and calculation where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain the calculation of tax liability involves dealing with uncertainty in the interpretation and application of complex tax law and significant judgment is necessary to determine whether based on the technical merit tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and ii measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition we recognize potential liability for anticipated tax audit issue in the united state and other tax jurisdiction based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether and the extent to which additional tax will be due although we believe the estimate are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matter will not be different from what is reflected in the historical income tax provision and accrual part of our financial process we must ass the likelihood that our deferred tax asset can be recovered if recovery is not likely the provision for tax must be increased by recording reserve in the form of valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable our judgment regarding future recoverability of our deferred tax asset may change due to various factor including change in or international tax law and change in market condition and their impact on our assessment of taxable income in future period these change if any may require adjustment to the deferred tax asset and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period when such determination are made inventory valuation allowancesinventory is valued net of allowance for unsalable or obsolete raw material work in process and finished good statistical allowance are determined quarterly for raw material and work in process based on historical disposal of inventory for salability and obsolescence reason for finished good quarterly statistical allowance are determined by comparing inventory level of individual part to historical shipment current backlog and estimated future sale in order to identify inventory considered unlikely to be sold specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is significant event not captured by the statistical allowance such an end of life part or demand with imminent risk of cancellation allowance are also calculated quarterly for instance where inventoried cost for individual product are in excess of the net realizable value for those product actual future write offs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reason may differ from estimate and calculation used to determine valuation allowance due to change in customer demand customer negotiation technology shift and other factor change in accounting standardssee note to the financial statement for information regarding the status of new accounting and reporting standard off balance sheet arrangementsas of december we had no significant off balance sheet arrangement defined in item ii of sec regulation commitment and contingenciessee note to the financial statement for discussion of our commitment and contingency quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskforeign exchange riskthe dollar is our functional currency for financial reporting our non entity own asset or liability denominated in dollar or other currency exchange rate fluctuation impact taxable income in those jurisdiction and consequently impact our effective tax rate our balance sheet also reflects amount remeasured from non dollar currency because most of the aggregate non dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contract which are based on year end balance and currency exchange rate hypothetical plus or minus fluctuation in non currency exchange rate relative to the dollar would result in pretax currency exchange gain or loss of approximately million we use these forward currency exchange contract to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuation may have on our non dollar net balance sheet exposure of december we had forward currency exchange contract outstanding with notional value of million to hedge net balance sheet exposure including million to sell japanese yen million to sell euro and million to sell british pound similar hedging activity existed at year end interest rate riskwe have the following potential exposure to change in interest rate the effect of change in interest rate on the fair value of our investment in cash equivalent and short term investment which could produce gain or loss and ii the effect of change in interest rate on the fair value of our debt of december hypothetical basis point increase in interest rate would decrease the fair value of our investment in cash equivalent and short term investment by about million and decrease the fair value of our long term debt by million because interest rate on our long term debt are fixed change in interest rate would not affect the cash flow associated with long term debt equity risklong term investment at year end include the following investment in mutual fund includes mutual fund that were selected to generate return that offset change in certain liability related to deferred compensation arrangement the mutual fund hold variety of debt and equity investment investment in venture capital fund includes investment in limited partnership accounted for under either the equity method or at cost non marketable equity security equity investment includes non marketable non publicly traded equity security investment in mutual fund are stated at fair value change in price of the mutual fund investment are expected to offset

qualifying observable price change investment in the remaining venture capital fund are stated using the equity method see note to the financial statement for detail of equity and other long term investment we also utilize total return swap to economically hedge exposure to change in liability related to the equity market risk of certain deferred compensation arrangement with employee gain or

development requirement product characteristic manufacturing process and distribution channel analog semiconductor change real world signal such sound temperature pressure or image by conditioning them amplifying them and often converting them to stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductor such embedded processor analog semiconductor are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by converting distributing storing discharging isolating and measuring electrical energy whether the equipment is plugged into wall or using battery our analog segment consists of two major product line power and signal chain embedded processing product are the digital brain of many type of electronic equipment they are designed to handle specific task and can be optimized for various combination of performance power and cost depending on the application during we reorganized the product line within our analog segment to simplify our business structure into our power and signal chain product line these change had no effect on either our previously reported consolidated financial statement or our reportable segment result we report the result of our remaining business activity in other other includes operating segment that do not meet the quantitative threshold for individually reportable segment and can not be aggregated with other operating segment other includes

million of dollar unless otherwise indicated we have reclassified certain amount in the prior period financial statement to conform to the presentation the preparation of financial statement requires the use of estimate from which final result may vary significant accounting policy and practicesrevenue recognitionwe generate revenue primarily from the sale of semiconductor product either directly to customer or to distributor we have variety of type of contract with our customer and distributor in determining whether contract exists we evaluate the term of the arrangement the relationship with the customer or distributor and their ability to pay we recognize revenue from sale of our product including sale to our distributor when control is transferred control is considered transferred when title and risk of loss pas when the customer becomes obligated to pay and where required when the customer ha accepted the product this transfer generally occurs at point in time upon shipment or delivery to the customer or distributor depending upon the term of the sale order payment for sale to customer and distributor is generally due on our standard commercial term for sale to distributor payment is not contingent upon resale of the product revenue from sale of our product that are subject to inventory consignment agreement is recognized at point in time when the customer or distributor pull product from consignment inventory that we store at designated location delivery and transfer of control occur at that point when title and risk of loss transfer and the customer or distributor becomes obligated to pay for the product pulled from inventory until the product are pulled for use or sale by the customer or distributor we retain control over the product disposition including the right to pull back or relocate the product the revenue recognized is adjusted based on allowance which are prepared on portfolio basis using most likely amount methodology based on analysis of historical data and contractual term these allowance which are not material generally include adjustment for pricing arrangement product return and incentive the length of time between invoicing and payment is not significant under any of our payment term in instance where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing we have determined our contract generally do not include significant financing component in addition we record an allowance for credit loss on account receivable that we estimate may not be collected we monitor collectability of account receivable primarily through review of account receivable aging when collection is at risk we ass the impact on amount recorded for credit loss and if necessary record charge in the period such determination is made we recognize shipping fee if any received from customer in revenue we include the related shipping and handling cost in cost of revenue the majority of our customer pay these fee directly to third party advertising costswe expense advertising and other promotional cost incurred this expense wa million million and million in and respectively income taxeswe account for income tax using an asset and liability approach we record the amount of tax payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax asset and liability for future tax consequence related to

consolidated balance sheet lease asset represent our right to use underlying asset for the lease term and lease liability represent our obligation to make lease payment over the lease term on the commencement date lease are evaluated for classification and asset and liability are recognized based on the present value of lease payment over the lease term we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement in determining the present value of lease payment operating lease expense is generally recognized on straight line basis over the lease term our lease value include option to extend or not to terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such option we have agreement with lease and non lease component which are accounted for single lease component lease with an initial lease term of month or le are not recorded on the balance sheet we recognize lease expense for these lease on straight line basis over the lease term earnings per share eps we use the two class method for calculating eps because the restricted stock unit rsus we grant are participating security containing non forfeitable right to receive dividend equivalent under the two class method portion of net income is allocated to rsus and excluded from the calculation of income allocated to common stock computation and reconciliation of

consist of mutual fund venture capital fund and non marketable equity security inventoriesinventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value cost is generally computed on currently adjusted standard cost basis which approximates cost on first in first out basis standard cost is based on the normal utilization of installed factory capacity cost associated with underutilization of capacity is expensed incurred inventory held at consignment location is included in our finished good inventory we review inventory quarterly for salability and obsolescence statistical allowance is provided for inventory considered unlikely to be sold the statistical allowance is based on an analysis of historical disposal activity historical customer shipment well estimated future sale specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is significant event not captured by the statistical allowance we write off inventory in the period in which disposal occurs property plant and equipment acquisition related intangible and other capitalized costsproperty plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful life using the straight line method our cost basis includes certain asset acquired in business combination that were initially recorded at fair value of the date of acquisition leasehold improvement are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvement we amortize acquisition related intangible on straight line basis over the estimated economic life of the asset capitalized software license generally are amortized on straight line basis over the term of the license fully depreciated or amortized asset are written off against accumulated depreciation or amortization impairment of long lived assetswe regularly review whether fact or circumstance exist that indicate the carrying value of property plant and equipment or other long lived asset including intangible asset are impaired we ass the recoverability of asset by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flow associated with those asset to their respective carrying amount any impairment charge is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those asset fair value is determined by available market valuation if applicable or by discounted cash flow goodwillgoodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicator arise we perform our annual goodwill impairment test of october for our reporting unit which compare the fair value for each reporting unit to it associated carrying value including goodwill see note for additional information foreign currencythe functional currency for our non subsidiary is the dollar account recorded in currency other than the dollar are remeasured into the functional currency current asset except inventory deferred tax other asset current liability and long term liability are remeasured at exchange rate in effect at the end of each reporting period property plant and equipment with associated depreciation and inventory are valued at historical exchange rate revenue and expense account other than depreciation for each month are remeasured at the appropriate daily rate of exchange currency exchange gain and loss from remeasurement are credited or charged to oi derivative and hedgingwe use derivative financial instrument to manage exposure to foreign exchange risk these instrument are primarily forward foreign currency exchange contract which are used economic hedge to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuation may have on our non dollar net balance sheet exposure gain and loss from change in the fair value of these forward foreign currency exchange contract are credited or charged to oi we do not apply hedge accounting to our foreign currency derivative instrument we are exposed to variability in compensation charge related to certain deferred compensation obligation to employee we use total return swap to economically hedge this exposure and offset the related compensation

weighted average assumption used expected expected life in year free interest expected dividend we determine expected volatility on all option granted using available implied volatility rate we believe that market based measure of implied volatility are currently the best available indicator of the expected volatility used in these estimate we determine expected life of option based on the historical option exercise experience of our optionees using rolling year average we believe the historical experience method is the best estimate of future exercise pattern currently available risk free interest rate are determined using the implied yield currently available for zero coupon government issue with remaining term equal to the expected life of the option expected dividend yield are based on the annualized approved quarterly dividend rate and the current market price of our common stock at the time of grant no assumption for future dividend rate change is included unless there is an approved plan to change the dividend in the near term the fair value per share of rsus is determined based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant our espp is discount

is designed to better match the interest rate sensitivity of the plan asset and liability the appropriate mix of equity and bond investment is determined primarily through the use of detailed asset liability modeling study that look to balance the impact of change in the discount rate against the need to provide asset growth to cover future service cost most of our plan around the world have greater proportion of fixed income security with return characteristic that are more closely aligned with change in the liability caused by discount rate volatility assumption and investment policiesu defined benefitu retiree health carenon defined average assumption used to determine benefit obligation discount long term pay an weighted average assumption used to determine net periodic benefit cost discount long term rate of return on plan long term pay an we utilize variety of method to select an appropriate discount rate depending on the depth of the corporate bond market in the country in which the benefit plan operates in the united state we use settlement approach whereby portfolio of bond is selected from the universe of actively traded high quality corporate bond the selected portfolio is designed to provide cash flow sufficient to pay the plan expected benefit payment when due the resulting discount rate reflects the rate of return of the selected portfolio of bond for our non location with sufficient number of actively traded high quality bond an analysis is performed in which the projected cash flow from the defined benefit plan are discounted against yield curve constructed with an appropriate universe of high quality corporate bond available in each country in this manner present value is developed the discount rate selected is the single equivalent rate that produce the same present value for country that lack sufficient corporate bond market government bond index is used to establish the discount rate for the expected long term rate of return on plan asset are based on future expectation for return for each asset class and the effect of periodic target asset allocation rebalancing we adjust the result for the payment of reasonable expense of the plan from plan asset we believe our assumption are appropriate based on the investment mix and long term nature of the plan investment assumption used for the non defined benefit plan reflect the
