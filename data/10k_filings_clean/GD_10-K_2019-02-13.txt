agreement without any significant disruption to operating activity raw material supplier and seasonalitywe depend on supplier and subcontractor for raw material component and subsystem our government customer is supplier on some of our program these supply network can experience price fluctuation and capacity constraint which can put pressure on our cost effective management and oversight of supplier and subcontractor is an important element of our successful performance we sometimes rely on one or two source of supply that if disrupted could impact our ability to meet our customer commitment we attempt to mitigate risk with our supplier by entering into long term agreement and leveraging company wide agreement to achieve economy of scale and by negotiating flexible pricing term in our customer contract we have not experienced and not foresee significant difficulty in obtaining the material component or supply necessary for our business operation our business is not seasonal in nature the receipt of contract award the availability of funding from the customer the incurrence of contract cost and unit delivery are all factor that influence the timing of our revenue in the

investment risk can be market wide well unique to specific industry or company the market risk faced by an investor in our stock are similar to the uncertainty faced by investor in broad range of industry there are some risk that apply more specifically to our business our revenue is concentrated with the government this customer relationship involves some specific risk in addition our sale to non customer expose to different financial and legal risk despite the varying nature of our and non defense and business aviation operation and the market they serve each segment share some common risk such the ongoing development of high technology product and the price availability and quality of commodity and subsystem the government provides significant portion of our revenue in approximately of our consolidated revenue wa from the government level of defense spending are driven by threat to national security competing demand for federal fund can pressure various area of spending decrease in government defense spending or change in spending allocation or priority could result in one or more of our program reduced delayed or terminated which could impact our financial performance the budget control act of bca establishes cap for defense spending over year period through including sequester mechanism that would impose additional defense cut in february the congress approved increase to the bca spending cap through fiscal year fy however the bca spending limit for fy and fy have not been increased or otherwise modified the president defense budget estimate for fy and beyond exceed the spending limit established by the bca result continued budget uncertainty and the risk of future sequestration cut remain unless the bca is repealed or significantly modified while it is impossible to predict the exact impact on our program or financial outlook in light of the inherent uncertainty attendant to the sequestration process the magnitude of potential funding reduction by the sequester mechanism written could in the aggregate have material adverse operational and financial consequence depending on the cut are allocated across the budget for additional information relating to the defense budget see the business environment section of management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation in item government contract are not always fully funded at inception and any funding is subject to disruption or delay our government revenue is funded by agency budget that operate on an october to september fiscal year early each calendar year the president of the united state present to the congress the budget for the upcoming fiscal year this budget proposes funding level for every federal agency and is the result of month of policy and program review throughout the executive branch for the remainder of the year the appropriation and authorization committee of the congress review the president budget proposal and establish the funding level for the upcoming fiscal year these level are enacted into law the executive office of the president administers the fund to the agency there are two primary risk associated with the government budget cycle first the annual process may be delayed or disrupted if the annual budget is not approved by the beginning of the government fiscal year portion of the government can shut or operate under continuing resolution that maintains spending at prior year level which can impact funding for our program and timing of new award second the congress typically appropriates fund on fiscal year basis even though contract performance may extend over many year future revenue under existing multi year contract is conditioned on the continuing availability of congressional appropriation change in appropriation in subsequent year may impact the funding available for these program delay or change in funding can impact the timing of available fund or lead to change in program content our government contract are subject to termination right by the customer government contract generally permit the government to terminate contract in whole or in part for convenience if contract is terminated for convenience contractor usually is entitled to receive payment for it allowable cost incurred and the proportionate share of fee or earnings for the work performed the government may also terminate contract for default in the event of breach by the contractor if contract is terminated for default the government in most case pay only for the work it ha accepted the termination of multiple or large program could have material adverse effect on our future revenue and earnings government contractor operate in highly regulated environment and are subject to audit by the government numerous government agency routinely audit and review government contractor these agency review contractor performance under it contract and compliance with applicable law regulation and standard the government also review the adequacy of and compliance with internal control system and policy including the contractor purchasing property estimating material earned value management and accounting system in some case audit may result in delayed payment or contractor cost not being reimbursed or subject to repayment if an audit or investigation were to result in allegation against contractor of improper or illegal activity civil or criminal penalty and administrative sanction could result including termination of contract forfeiture of profit suspension of payment fine and suspension or prohibition from business with the government in addition reputational harm could result if allegation of impropriety were made in some case audit may result in dispute with the respective government agency that can result in negotiated settlement arbitration or litigation moreover new law regulation or standard or change to existing one can increase our performance and compliance cost and reduce our profitability our aerospace segment is subject to changing customer demand for business aircraft the business jet market is driven by the demand for business aviation product and service by corporate and government customer in the united state and around the world the aerospace segment result also depend on other factor including general economic condition the availability of credit pricing pressure and trend in capital good market in addition if customer default on existing contract and the contract are not replaced the segment anticipated revenue and profitability could be reduced materially earnings and margin depend on our ability to perform on our contract when agreeing to contractual term our management team make assumption and projection about future condition and event the accounting for our contract and program requires assumption and estimate about these condition and event these projection and estimate ass the productivity and availability of labor the complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of material and component and schedule requirement if there is significant change in one or more of these circumstance estimate or assumption or if the risk under our contract are not managed adequately the profitability of contract could be adversely affected this could affect earnings and margin materially earnings and margin depend in part on subcontractor and vendor performance we rely on other company to provide material component and subsystem for our product subcontractor also perform some of the service that we provide to our customer we depend on these subcontractor and vendor to meet our contractual obligation in full compliance with customer requirement and applicable law misconduct by subcontractor such failure to comply with procurement regulation or engaging in unauthorized activity may harm our future revenue and earnings we manage our supplier base carefully to avoid customer issue we sometimes rely on only one or two source of supply that if disrupted could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our customer commitment our ability to perform our obligation may be materially adversely affected if one or more of these supplier is unable to provide the agreed upon material perform the agreed upon service in timely and cost effective manner or engages in misconduct or other improper activity sale and operation outside the united state are subject to different risk that may be associated with doing business in foreign country in some country there is increased chance for economic legal or political change and procurement procedure may be le robust or mature which may complicate the contracting process our non operation may be sensitive to and impacted by change in foreign government national policy and priority political leadership and budget which may be influenced by change in threat environment geopolitical uncertainty volatility in economic condition and other economic and political factor change and development in any of these matter or factor may occur suddenly and could impact funding for program or delay purchasing decision or customer payment non transaction can involve increased financial and legal risk arising from foreign exchange rate variability and differing legal system our non operation are subject to and foreign law and regulation including law and regulation relating to import export control technology transfer the foreign corrupt practice act and other anti corruption law and the international traffic in arm regulation itar an unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factor or failure to comply with or foreign law could result in administrative civil or criminal liability including suspension or debarment from government contract or suspension of our export privilege and could materially adversely affect revenue and earnings associated with our non operation addition some non government customer require contractor to enter into letter of credit performance or surety bond bank guarantee and other similar financial arrangement we may also be required to agree to specific in country purchase manufacturing agreement or financial support arrangement known offset that require to satisfy investment or other requirement or face penalty offset requirement may extend over several year and could require to team with local company to fulfill these requirement if we do not satisfy these financial or offset requirement our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected our future success depends in part on our ability to develop new product and technology and maintain qualified workforce to meet the need of our customer many of the product and service we provide involve sophisticated technology and engineering with related complex manufacturing and system integration process our customer requirement change and evolve regularly accordingly our future performance depends in part on our ability to continue to develop manufacture and provide innovative product and service and bring those offering to market quickly at cost effective price some new product particularly in our aerospace segment must meet extensive and time consuming regulatory requirement that are often outside our control additionally due to the highly specialized nature of our business we must hire and retain the skilled and qualified personnel necessary to perform the service required by our customer to the extent that the demand for skilled personnel exceeds supply we could experience higher labor recruiting or training cost in order to attract and retain such employee if we were unable to develop new product that meet customer changing need and satisfy regulatory requirement in timely manner or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected we have made and expect to continue to make investment including acquisition and joint venture that involve risk and uncertainty when evaluating potential acquisition and joint venture we make judgment regarding the value of business opportunity technology and other asset and the risk and cost of potential liability based on information available to at the time of the transaction whether we realize the anticipated benefit from these transaction depends on multiple factor including our integration of the business involved the performance of the underlying product capability or technology market condition following the acquisition and acquired liability including some that may not have been identified prior to the acquisition these factor could materially adversely affect our financial result change in business condition may cause goodwill and other intangible asset to become impaired goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible asset acquired in business combination goodwill is not amortized and remains on our balance sheet indefinitely unless there is an impairment or sale of portion of the business goodwill is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis or when circumstance indicate that the likelihood of an impairment is greater than such circumstance include significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting unit or decision to dispose of reporting unit or significant portion of reporting unit we face some uncertainty in our business environment due to variety of challenge including change in defense spending we may experience unforeseen circumstance that adversely affect the value of our goodwill or intangible asset and trigger an evaluation of the amount of the recorded goodwill and intangible asset future write offs of goodwill or other intangible asset result of an impairment in the business could materially adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition our business could be negatively impacted by cyber security event and other disruption we face various cyber security threat including threat to our information technology it infrastructure and attempt to gain access to our proprietary or classified information denial of service attack well to the physical security of our facility and employee and threat from terrorist act we also design and manage it system and product that contain it system for various customer we generally face the security threat for these system for our own internal system in addition we face cyber threat from entity that may seek to target through our customer vendor subcontractor and other third party with whom we do business accordingly we maintain information security staff policy and procedure for managing risk to our

including discussion of our major product and service see the business discussion contained in item the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statement included in item business environmentwith approximately of our revenue from the government government spending level particularly defense spending influence our financial performance over the past several year defense spending ha been mandated by the budget control act of bca the bca establishes spending cap over year period through including sequester mechanism that would impose additional defense cut if an annual defense appropriation bill is enacted the spending cap on february the congress approved increase to the bca spending cap and budget for fiscal year fy on september the fy defense appropriation bill wa signed into law it totaled billion and included billion in the base budget in compliance with the modified bca spending cap and billion for overseas contingency operation however of the filing of this form on february seven other appropriation bill funding multiple federal civilian agency have not been enacted these federal agency had been operating since the beginning of the government fiscal year under series of continuing resolution cr which funded the agency at fy spending level the last in this series of cr expired on december resulting in partial government shutdown for these agency on january new cr wa approved providing funding for these federal agency through february our greatest concentration of work for the impacted agency is in our information technology segment where this work represents le than of the segment revenue additionally our aerospace segment wa affected by the shutdown of the federal aviation administration faa which impacted the type certification process for the new aircraft the partial government shutdown did not have material impact on our result of operation financial condition or cash flow and we do not anticipate that the current cr or subsequent extension will have material impact however if another partial government shutdown occurred the longer the shutdown continued the risk of material impact would increase the long term outlook for our defense business is influenced by the military funding priority the diversity of our program and customer our insight into customer requirement stemming from our incumbency on core program our ability to evolve our product to address fast changing threat environment and our proven track record of successful contract execution international demand for military equipment and information technology present opportunity for our non operation and export from our north american business while the revenue potential can be significant there are risk to doing business in foreign country including changing budget priority and overall spending pressure unique to each country in our aerospace segment we continue to experience strong demand across our product portfolio we expect our continued investment in the development of new aircraft product and technology to support the aerospace segment long term growth similarly we believe the aircraft service business will be strong source of revenue the global business jet fleet continues to grow of operationsintroductionan understanding of our accounting practice is necessary in the evaluation of our financial statement and operating result the following paragraph explain how we recognize revenue and operating cost in our operating segment we account for revenue in accordance with accounting standard codification asc topic revenue from contract with customer in the aerospace segment we record revenue on contract for new aircraft when the customer obtains control of the asset which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the fully outfitted aircraft revenue associated with the segment custom completion of narrow body and wide body aircraft and the segment service business is recognized work progress or upon delivery of service fluctuation in revenue from period to period result from the number and mix of new aircraft delivery progress on aircraft completion and the level and type of aircraft service performed during the period the majority of the aerospace segment operating cost relates to new aircraft production on firm order and consists of labor material subcontractor and overhead cost the cost are accumulated in production lot recorded in inventory and recognized operating cost at aircraft delivery based on the estimated average unit cost in production lot while change in the estimated average unit cost for production lot impact the level of operating cost the amount of operating cost reported in given period is based largely on the number and type of aircraft delivered operating cost in the aerospace segment completion and service business are recognized generally incurred for new aircraft operating earnings and margin are function of the price of our aircraft our operational efficiency in manufacturing and outfitting the aircraft and the mix of ultra large cabin large cabin and mid cabin aircraft delivery additional factor affecting the segment earnings and margin include the volume mix and profitability of completion and service work performed the volume of and market for pre owned aircraft and the level of general and administrative and net research and development cost incurred by the segment in the defense segment revenue on long term government contract is recognized generally over time the work progress either product are produced or service are rendered typically revenue is recognized over time using cost incurred to date relative to total estimated cost at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligation incurred cost represents work performed which corresponds with and thereby best depicts the transfer of control to the customer contract cost include labor material overhead and when appropriate expense variance in cost recognized from period to period reflect primarily increase and decrease in production or activity level on individual contract cost are used measure of progress year over year variance in cost result in corresponding variance in revenue which we generally refer to volume operating earnings and margin in the defense segment are driven by change in volume performance or contract mix performance refers to change in profitability based on adjustment to estimate at completion on individual contract these adjustment result from increase or decrease to the estimated value of the contract the estimated cost to complete the contract or both therefore change in cost incurred in the period compared with prior period do not necessarily impact profitability it is only when total estimated cost at completion on given contract change without corresponding change in the contract value that the profitability of that contract may be impacted contract mix refers to change in the volume of higher versus lower margin work higher or lower margin can result from number of factor contract type fixed price cost reimbursable and type of work development production consolidated overview in review outstanding operating performance record high revenue of billion with growth in all of our segment operating earnings of billion increased from record high earnings from continuing operation per diluted share of an increase of from million outstanding share repurchased for billion and billion paid in cash dividend returning over of our free cash flow from operation to shareholder robust backlog of billion increased billion or from supporting our long term growth expectation several significant contract award received in in our defense segment review of ended december variancerevenue operating cost and expense operating operating our consolidated revenue increased in the largest driver of the increase wa the acquisition of csra in our information technology segment excluding csra revenue increased by driven by growth in all of our segment operating cost and expense increased in due primarily to the csra acquisition including the impact of intangible asset amortization expense and one time transaction related charge associated with cost to complete the acquisition resulting in lower margin compared with the operating margin wa also impacted by le favorable aircraft delivery mix in our aerospace segment consistent with our expectation we transition to the new and aircraft review of ended december variancerevenue operating cost and expense operating operating realized top line growth in driven by higher volume across our combat system segment and increased revenue from aircraft delivery and aircraft service in our aerospace segment these increase were offset partially by lower revenue in our mission system segment driven by funding delay caused by the extended fy cr while revenue increased operating cost and expense decreased resulting in increase in operating earnings and margin growth of basis point operating earnings and margin grew at each of our segment in review of operating segmentsyear ended december revenue operating earnings revenue operating earnings revenue operating earningsaerospace total is discussion of operating result and outlook for each of our operating segment for the aerospace segment result are analyzed by specific type of product and service consistent with how the segment is managed for the defense segment the discussion is based on the line of product and service offered with supplemental discussion of specific contract and program when significant to the result additional information regarding our segment can be found in note to the consolidated financial statement in item aerospacereview of ended december variancerevenue operating operating gulfstream aircraft delivery in unit the increase in the aerospace segment revenue in consisted of the following aircraft service manufacturing and completion pre owned increase service revenue increased due to higher demand for maintenance work and the acquisition in the second quarter of of hawker pacific leading provider of integrated aviation solution across asia pacific and the middle east additionally we had seven pre owned aircraft sale in compared five in these increase were offset partially by lower volume of custom completion of narrow body and wide body aircraft the change in the segment operating earnings in consisted of the following aircraft manufacturing and completion aircraft owned other decrease aircraft manufacturing and completion operating earnings were down due to shift in the mix of gulfstream aircraft delivery and the typical lower margin associated with the initial unit of new aircraft model well performance challenge in the wide body aircraft custom completion business aircraft service operating earnings were particularly strong due to favorable cost performance and the mix of service provided in addition operating earnings were impacted favorably by lower other expense including reduced expense we completed the development and certification program overall the aerospace segment operating margin decreased basis point to review of ended december variancerevenue operating operating gulfstream aircraft delivery in unit the aerospace segment revenue increased in due primarily to additional delivery of the ultra large cabin and mid cabin aircraft offset partially by decrease in the number of and large cabin aircraft delivery aircraft service revenue increased driven by higher demand for maintenance work and the acquisition of fixed base operation fbo in operating earnings increased in due to favorable cost performance and the mix of ultra large and large cabin aircraft delivery other expense were higher in due primarily to increased expense associated with product development effort the segment progressed with the certification of the and aircraft overall the aerospace segment operating margin increased basis point to outlookwe expect the aerospace segment revenue to be around billion operating margin is expected to be approximately down from result of mix shift the segment continues it transition to the new and aircraft well higher anticipated pre owned aircraft sale which

cash flow from operation and return on invested capital roic to measure our performance in these area while we believe these metric provide useful information they are not defined operating measure under gaap and there are limitation associated with their use our calculation of these metric may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measure of other company due to potential difference in the method of calculation result the use of these metric should not be considered in isolation from or substitute for other gaap measure free cash flow we define free cash flow from operation net cash provided by operating activity le capital expenditure we believe free cash flow from operation is useful measure for investor because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our business for purpose such repaying maturing debt funding business acquisition repurchasing our common stock and paying dividend we use free cash flow from operation to ass the quality of our earnings and key performance measure in evaluating management the following table reconciles the free cash flow from operation with net cash provided by operating activity classified on the consolidated statement of

product and service to be delivered under firm government contract under which we would expect full recourse under normal contract termination clause represents other long term liability on our consolidated balance sheet including the current portion of these liability the projected timing of cash flow associated with these obligation is based on management estimate which are based largely on historical experience this amount also includes all liability under our defined benefit retirement plan see note to the consolidated financial statement in item for information regarding these

guarantee trade in option see note to the consolidated financial statement in item for discussion of letter of credit and aircraft trade in option of critical accounting policiesmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation is based on our consolidated financial statement which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statement in accordance with gaap requires that we make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset and liability and the disclosure of contingent asset and liability at the date of the financial statement well the reported amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimate including most pervasively those related to various assumption and projection for our long term contract and program other significant estimate include those related to goodwill and intangible asset income tax pension and other post retirement benefit worker compensation warranty obligation and litigation contingency we employ judgment in making our estimate but they are based on historical experience currently available information and various other assumption that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance these estimate form the basis for making judgment about the carrying value of asset and liability that are not readily available from other source actual result may differ from these estimate we believe our judgment is applied consistently and produce financial information that fairly depicts the result of operation for all period presented in our opinion the following policy are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application revenue the majority of our revenue is derived from long term contract and program that can span several year we account for revenue in accordance with asc topic revenue from contract with customer the unit of account in asc topic is performance obligation contract transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation within that contract and recognized revenue when or the performance obligation is satisfied our performance obligation are satisfied over time work progress or at point in time substantially all of our revenue in the defense segment is recognized over time because control is transferred continuously to our customer typically revenue is recognized over time using cost incurred to date relative to total estimated cost at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligation incurred cost represents work performed which corresponds with and thereby best depicts the transfer of control to the customer contract cost include labor material overhead and when appropriate expense the majority of our revenue recognized at point in time is for the manufacture of business jet aircraft in our aerospace segment revenue on these contract is recognized when the customer obtains control of the asset which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the fully outfitted aircraft accounting for long term contract and program involves the use of various technique to estimate total contract revenue and cost for long term contract we estimate the profit on contract the difference between the total estimated revenue and expected cost to complete contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract contract estimate are based on various assumption to project the outcome of future event that often span several year these assumption include labor productivity and availability the complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of material the performance of subcontractor and the availability and timing of funding from the customer the nature of our contract give rise to several type of variable consideration including claim and award and incentive fee we include in our contract estimate additional revenue for submitted contract or claim against the customer when we believe we have an enforceable right to the modification or claim the amount can be estimated reliably and it realization is probable in evaluating these criterion we consider the contractual legal basis for the claim the cause of any additional cost incurred the reasonableness of those cost and the objective evidence available to support the claim we include award or incentive fee in the estimated transaction price when there is basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee these estimate are based on historical award experience anticipated performance and our best judgment at the time because of our certainty in estimating these amount they are included in the transaction price of our contract and the associated remaining performance obligation significant change in one or more of these estimate could affect the profitability of our contract we review and update our contract related estimate regularly we recognize adjustment in estimated profit on contract under the cumulative catch up method under this method the impact of the adjustment on profit recorded to date on contract is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified revenue and profit in future period of contract performance are recognized using the adjusted estimate the aggregate impact of adjustment in contract estimate increased our operating earnings and diluted earnings per share by in in and in while no adjustment on any one contract wa material to our consolidated financial statement in or the amount in wa negatively impacted by loss on the design and development phase of the ajax program in our combat system segment and cost growth associated with the restart of the navy ddg program in our marine system segment consistent with industry practice we classify asset and liability related to long term contract current even though some of these amount may not be realized within one year the timing of revenue recognition billing and cash collection result in billed account receivable unbilled receivables contract asset and customer advance and deposit contract liability on the consolidated balance sheet these asset and liability are reported on the consolidated balance sheet on contract by contract basis at the end of each reporting period csra acquisition we are required to estimate the fair value of the asset acquired and liability assumed in business combination of the acquisition date including identified intangible asset the amount of purchase price paid in excess of the net asset acquired is recorded goodwill the fair value are estimated in accordance with the principle of asc fair value measurement which defines fair value the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant the fair value of the net asset acquired are determined primarily using level input input that are unobservable to the marketplace participant the most significant of the fair value estimate is related to long lived asset specifically intangible asset subject to amortization we have valued billion of acquired intangible asset in connection with the csra acquisition this amount wa determined based primarily on csra projected cash flow the projected cash flow include various assumption including the timing of work embedded in backlog success in securing future business profitability of work and the appropriate risk adjusted interest rate used to discount the projected cash flow we are in various phase of valuing the asset acquired and liability assumed and our estimate of these value wa still preliminary on december therefore these provisional amount are subject to change we continue to evaluate information required to complete the valuation throughout the measurement period which will extend into the second quarter of reorganization of operating segment and composition of reporting unit concurrent with the acquisition of csra in april we reorganized our information system and technology operating in accordance with the nature of the segment product and service into the information technology and mission system segment this reorganization similarly changed the composition of our reporting unit accordingly goodwill of the information system and technology reporting unit wa reassigned to the information technology and mission system reporting unit using relative fair value allocation approach of the date of the reorganization long lived asset and goodwill we review long lived asset including intangible asset subject to amortization for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable we ass the recoverability of the carrying value of asset held for use based on review of undiscounted projected cash flow impairment loss where identified are measured the excess of the carrying value of the long lived asset over it estimated fair value determined by discounted projected cash flow goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible asset acquired in business combination we review goodwill for impairment annually or when circumstance indicate that the likelihood of an impairment is greater than such circumstance include significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting unit or decision to dispose of reporting unit or significant portion of reporting unit the test for goodwill impairment is two step process to first identify potential goodwill impairment for each reporting unit by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting unit to it respective carrying value and if necessary measure the amount of the impairment loss the process requires significant level of estimation and use of judgment by management particularly the estimate of the fair value of our reporting unit our reporting unit are consistent with our operating segment in note to the consolidated financial statement in item we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit based primarily on the discounted projected cash flow of the underlying operation this requires numerous assumption including the timing of work embedded in our backlog our performance and profitability under our contract our success in securing future business the appropriate risk adjusted interest rate used to discount the projected cash flow and terminal value growth rate applied to the final year of projected cash flow due to the variable inherent in our estimate of fair value difference in assumption may have material effect on the result of our impairment analysis to ass the reasonableness of our discounted projected cash flow we compare the sum of our reporting unit fair value to our market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium the excess of the market capitalization over the sum of the reporting unit fair value additionally we evaluate the reasonableness of each reporting unit fair value by comparing the fair value to comparable peer company and recent comparable market transaction we completed the required annual goodwill impairment test of december the first step of the goodwill impairment test compare the fair value of each of our reporting unit to it carrying value the result of the first step test indicated that for each of our reporting unit no impairment existed the estimated fair value of each of our reporting unit wa substantially in excess of it respective carrying value of december with the exception of our information technology reporting unit for which the excess wa slightly more than this is due to the significant size of the csra acquisition relative to the newly formed information technology reporting unit and it recent acquisition date given that the net book value of this business wa recorded at it fair value during the current reporting period the reporting unit carrying value by default closely approximates it fair value at year end the carrying value and fair value of the information technology reporting unit are closely aligned material change in the fair value or carrying value would put the reporting unit at risk of goodwill impairment for example our ability to realize synergy from the acquisition of csra and the level of funding in the government budget contract in our portfolio are key assumption in our projection of revenue earnings and cash flow if our actual experience in future year fall significantly below our current projection the fair value of the reporting unit could be negatively impacted similarly an increase in interest rate would lower our discounted cash flow and negatively impact the fair value of the reporting unit we believe our projection and assumption are reasonable but it is possible they could change impacting our fair value estimate or the carrying value could change commitment and contingency we are subject to litigation and other legal proceeding arising either from the normal course of business or under provision relating to the protection of the environment estimating liability and cost associated with these matter requires the use of judgment we record charge against earnings when liability associated with claim or pending or threatened litigation is probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable the ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matter may change further fact and circumstance become known other contract cost other contract cost represent amount that are not currently allocable to government contract such portion of our estimated worker compensation obligation other insurance related assessment pension and other post retirement benefit and environmental expense these cost will become allocable to contract generally after they are paid we have elected to defer these cost in other current asset on the consolidated balance sheet they can be allocated to contract we expect to recover these cost through ongoing business including existing backlog and probable follow on contract we regularly ass the probability of recovery of these cost this assessment requires that we make assumption about future contract cost the extent of cost recovery under our contract and the amount of future contract activity these estimate are based on our best judgment if the backlog in the future doe not support the continued deferral of these cost the profitability of our remaining contract could be adversely affected retirement plan our defined benefit pension and other post retirement benefit cost and obligation depend on several assumption and estimate the key assumption include interest rate used to discount estimated future liability and projected long term rate of return on plan asset we base the discount rate on current yield curve developed from portfolio of high quality fixed income investment with maturity consistent with the projected benefit payout period we use the spot rate approach to identify individual spot rate along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each projected service cost and discounted benefit obligation payment we determine the long term rate of return on asset based on consideration of historical and forward looking return and the current and expected asset allocation strategy in we decreased the expected long term rate of return on asset in our primary government and commercial pension plan by basis point following an assessment of the historical and expected long term return of our various asset class beginning in we will decrease the expected long term rate of return on asset in our primary other post retirement benefit plan by basis point following an assessment of the historical and expected long term return of our various asset class this decrease is not expected to have material impact on our benefit cost these retirement plan assumption are based on our best judgment including consideration of current and future market condition in the event any of the assumption change pension and other post retirement benefit cost could increase or decrease for further discussion including the impact of hypothetical change in the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan asset see note to the consolidated financial statement in item discussed under other contract cost our contractual arrangement with the government provide for the recovery of benefit cost for our government retirement plan we have elected to defer recognition of the benefit cost until such cost can be allocated to contract therefore the impact of annual change in financial reporting assumption on the retirement benefit cost for these plan doe not immediately affect our operating result accounting standard update see note to the consolidated financial statement in item for information regarding accounting standard we adopted in and other new accounting standard that have been issued by the financial accounting standard board fasb but are not effective until after december item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskwe are exposed to market risk primarily from foreign currency exchange rate interest rate commodity price and investment see note to the consolidated financial statement in item for discussion of these risk the following quantifies the market risk exposure arising from hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate we had notional forward exchange and interest rate swap contract outstanding of billion and billion on december and respectively unfavorable rate movement in our portfolio of forward exchange and interest rate swap contract would have resulted in the following hypothetical incremental pretax gain loss dollar in million unrecognized currency risk our exchange rate sensitivity relates primarily to change in the canadian dollar euro swiss franc and british pound exchange rate these loss and gain would be offset by corresponding gain and loss in the remeasurement of the underlying transaction being hedged we believe these foreign currency forward exchange contract and the offsetting underlying commitment when taken together do not create material market risk interest rate risk our financial instrument subject to interest rate risk include variable rate commercial paper and fixed and floating rate long term debt obligation on december we had billion par value of fixed rate debt billion of floating rate note and of commercial paper outstanding our fixed rate debt obligation are not putable and we do not trade these security in the market unfavorable interest rate movement would not have material impact on the fair value of our fixed rate debt described in

aerospace and defense company that offer broad portfolio of product and service in business aviation combat vehicle weapon system and munition information technology it service command control communication computer intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance solution and shipbuilding and ship repair on april we completed our acquisition of csra inc csra see note for further discussion of the acquisition concurrent with the acquisition for segment reporting purpose we reorganized our information system and technology operating segment into two separate segment information technology and mission system our company now ha five operating segment aerospace combat system information technology mission system and marine system the latter four segment we collectively refer to our defense segment prior period segment information ha been restated for this change basis of consolidation and classification the consolidated financial statement include the account of general dynamic corporation and our wholly owned and majority owned subsidiary we eliminate all inter company balance and transaction in the consolidated financial statement some prior year amount have been reclassified among financial statement account or disclosure to conform to the current year presentation consistent with industry practice we classify asset and liability related to long term contract current even though some of these amount may not be realized within one year further discussion of our significant accounting policy is contained in the other note to these financial statement use of estimate the nature of our business requires that we make estimate and assumption in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle gaap these estimate and assumption affect the reported amount of asset and liability and the disclosure of contingent asset and liability at the date of the financial statement well the reported amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period we base our estimate on historical experience currently available information and various other assumption that we believe are reasonable under the circumstance actual result could differ from these estimate discontinued operation net of tax concurrent with the acquisition of csra we were required by government customer to dispose of certain csra operation to address an organizational conflict of interest with respect to service provided to the customer in we sold these operation in accordance with gaap the sale did not result in gain for financial reporting purpose however the sale generated taxable gain resulting in tax expense of in we settled litigation with the navy related to the terminated aircraft contract in the company former tactical military aircraft business in connection with the settlement we released some right to reimbursement of cost on ship under contract at our bath maine shipyard we progressed through the shipbuilding process we determined that the cost associated with this settlement wa greater than anticipated therefore in we recognized an loss net of tax to adjust the previously recognized value in addition we recognized of loss net of tax in related to other former operation of the company research and development expense company sponsored research and development expense including product development cost were in in and in the expense in and reflected ongoing product development effort in the aerospace segment we progressed with the certification of our two newest gulfstream aircraft model the and expense are included in operating cost and expense in the consolidated statement of earnings in the period in which they are incurred customer sponsored expense are charged directly to the related contract the aerospace segment ha cost sharing arrangement with some of it supplier that enhance the segment internal development capability and offset portion of the financial cost associated with the segment product development effort these arrangement explicitly state that supplier contribution are for reimbursement of cost we incur in the development of new aircraft model and technology and we retain substantial right in the product developed under these arrangement we record amount received from these cost sharing arrangement reduction of expense we have no obligation to refund any amount received under the agreement regardless of the outcome of the development effort under the typical term of an agreement payment received from supplier for their share of the cost are based on milestone and are recognized received our policy is to defer payment in excess of the cost we have incurred interest net net interest expense consisted of the following year ended december expense income interest expense net increase in is due primarily to the impact of financing the csra acquisition including the issuance of billion of fixed and floating rate note in the second quarter of see note for additional information regarding our debt obligation including interest rate cash and equivalent and investment in debt and equity security we consider security with maturity of three month or le to be cash equivalent our cash balance are invested primarily in time deposit rated or higher our investment in other security are included in other current and noncurrent asset on the consolidated balance sheet see note we report our equity security at fair value with subsequent change in fair value recognized in net earnings we report our available for sale debt security at fair value with unrealized gain and loss recognized component of other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income we had no trading or held to maturity debt security on december or other contract cost other contract cost represent amount that are not currently allocable to government contract such portion of our estimated worker compensation obligation other insurance related assessment pension and other post retirement benefit and environmental expense these cost will become allocable to contract generally after they are paid we expect to recover these cost through ongoing business including existing backlog and probable follow on contract if the backlog in the future doe not support the continued deferral of these cost the profitability of our remaining contract could be adversely affected other contract cost on december and were and respectively and are included in other current asset on the consolidated balance sheet lived asset and goodwill we review long lived asset including intangible asset subject to amortization for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable we ass the recoverability of the carrying value of asset held for use based on review of undiscounted projected cash flow impairment loss where identified are measured the excess of the carrying value of the long lived asset over it estimated fair value determined by discounted projected cash flow concurrent with the acquisition of csra in april we reorganized our information system and technology operating segment in accordance with the nature of the segment product and service into the information technology and mission system segment this reorganization similarly changed the composition of our reporting unit accordingly goodwill of the information system and technology reporting unit wa reassigned to the information technology and mission system reporting unit using relative fair value allocation approach of the date of the reorganization we review goodwill for impairment annually or when circumstance indicate that the likelihood of an impairment is greater than goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible asset acquired in business combination the test for goodwill impairment is two step process to first identify potential goodwill impairment for each reporting unit by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting unit to it respective carrying value and then if necessary measure the amount of the impairment loss our reporting unit are consistent with our operating segment in note we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit based primarily on the discounted projected cash flow of the underlying operation we completed the required annual goodwill impairment test of december the result of the first step test indicated that for each of our reporting unit no impairment existed the estimated fair value of each of our reporting unit wa substantially in excess of it respective carrying value of december with the exception of our information technology reporting unit the estimated fair value of the information technology reporting unit exceeded it carrying value of december by slightly more than this is due to the significant size of the csra acquisition relative to the newly formed information technology reporting unit and it recent acquisition date given that the net book value of this business wa recorded at it fair value during the current reporting period the reporting unit carrying value by default closely approximates it fair value at year end the carrying value and fair value of the information technology reporting unit are closely aligned material change in the fair value or carrying value would put the reporting unit at risk of goodwill impairment for example our ability to realize synergy from the acquisition of csra and the level of funding in the government budget for contract in our portfolio are key assumption in our projection of revenue earnings and cash flow if our actual experience in future year fall significantly below our current projection the fair value of the reporting unit could be negatively impacted similarly an increase in interest rate would lower our discounted cash flow and negatively impact the fair value of the reporting unit we believe the projection and assumption we used in estimating fair value are reasonable but it is possible they could change impacting our fair value estimate or the carrying value could change for summary of our goodwill by reporting unit see note accounting standard update on january we adopted the following accounting standard issued by the financial accounting standard board fasb asu financial instrument overall subtopic recognition and measurement of financial asset and financial liability asu address certain aspect of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instrument specific to our business asu requires equity investment to be measured at fair value with change in fair value recognized in net income the asu eliminates the available for sale classification for equity investment that recognized change in fair value component of other comprehensive income we adopted the standard on modified retrospective basis on january and recognized the cumulative effect increase to retained earnings on the date of adoption asu statement of cash flow topic classification of certain cash receipt and cash payment asu is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain cash receipt and cash payment are presented and classified in the consolidated statement of cash flow by providing guidance on eight specific cash flow issue we adopted the standard retrospectively on january the adoption of the asu did not have material effect on our cash flow in and asu compensation retirement benefit topic improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost asu requires the service cost component of net retirement benefit cost to be reported separately from the other component of net retirement benefit cost in the consolidated statement of earnings we adopted the standard retrospectively on january our restated operating earnings increased and in and respectively due to the reclassification of the non service cost component of net benefit cost other income decreased by the same amount with no impact to net earnings asu income statement reporting comprehensive income topic reclassification of certain tax effect from accumulated other comprehensive income asu allows the reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings of stranded tax effect resulting from the implementation of the tax cut and job act tax reform enacted on december we adopted the standard on january and recognized increase to retained earnings on the date of adoption there are several other accounting standard that have been issued by the fasb but are not effective until after december including the following asu lease topic asu requires the recognition of lease right and obligation asset and liability on the balance sheet previously lessee were not required to recognize on the balance sheet asset and liability arising from operating lease the asu also requires disclosure of key information about leasing arrangement asu is effective on january using modified retrospective method of adoption of january in july the fasb issued asu lease topic targeted improvement which provides an alternative transition method of adoption permitting the recognition of cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings on the date of adoption in lieu of retrospective adoption we are adopting the standard effective january using the alternative transition method provided by asu in order to adopt the new standard we developed comprehensive project plan and established cross functional project team to guide the implementation the project plan included implementing third party software solution to facilitate the consolidation of our lease for reporting purpose reviewing all form of lease performing completeness assessment of our lease population analyzing the optional practical expedient available in the new standard and updating our business process system and control to meet the requirement of the new standard the new standard provides several optional practical expedient for use in transition we have elected to use what the fasb ha deemed the package of practical expedient which allows not to reassess our previous conclusion about lease identification lease classification and the accounting treatment for initial direct cost we have not elected the practical expedient pertaining to the use of hindsight and easement the asu also provides several optional practical expedient for the ongoing accounting for lease we have elected the short term lease recognition exemption for all lease that qualify meaning that for these lease we will not recognize right of use rou asset or lease liability on our consolidated balance sheet additionally we have elected to use the practical expedient to not separate lease and non lease component for lease of real estate meaning that for these lease the non lease component are included in the associated rou asset and lease liability balance on our consolidated balance sheet the most significant effect of the standard on our consolidated financial statement are the recognition of new rou asset and lease liability on our consolidated balance sheet for our operating lease and significant new disclosure about our leasing activity we expect to recognize operating lease liability ranging from to billion with corresponding rou asset of the same amount based on the present value of the remaining lease payment over the lease term the new standard is not expected to have material impact on our result of operation or cash flow asu derivative and hedging topic targeted improvement to accounting for hedging activity asu is intended to simplify hedge accounting by better aligning an entity financial reporting for hedging relationship with it risk management activity through the expansion of the type of financial and nonfinancial hedging strategy that are eligible for hedge accounting the asu also simplifies the application of the hedge accounting guidance including eliminating the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness for cash flow hedge existing at the adoption date the standard requires adoption on modified retrospective basis with cumulative effect adjustment to the consolidated balance sheet of the beginning of the year of adoption the amendment to presentation guidance and disclosure requirement are required to be adopted prospectively we adopted the standard on january the adoption of the asu did not have material effect on our result of operation financial condition or cash flow acquisition and divestiture goodwill and intangible assetscsra acquisition on april we acquired of the outstanding share of csra for per share in cash plus the assumption of outstanding net debt csra ha been combined with general dynamic information technology gdit to create premier provider of it solution to the defense intelligence and federal civilian market except where otherwise noted in the note to the consolidated financial statement change in balance and activity were generally driven by the csra acquisition purchase price and fair value of net asset acquired the cash purchase price totaled billion and consisted of the following csra share outstanding in million consideration per csra share paid to purchase outstanding csra share paid to extinguish csra settlement of outstanding csra stock option and restricted stock purchase price following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the estimated fair value of the asset acquired and liability assumed on the acquisition date with the excess recorded goodwill cash and equivalent current plant and equipment asset noncurrent asset payable customer advance and deposit current capital lease obligation other current liability noncurrent capital lease obligation noncurrent deferred tax liability other noncurrent liability total liability net asset acquired have continued to obtain information to refine the estimated fair value the additional information obtained during the quarter did not result in any material adjustment however these provisional amount are subject to change we continue to evaluate information required to complete the valuation throughout the measurement period which will extend into the second quarter of we have valued billion of acquired intangible asset which consist of acquired backlog and probable follow on work and associated customer relationship contract and program intangible asset with weighted average life of year the intangible asset will be amortized using an accelerated method which approximates the pattern of how the economic benefit is expected to be used under this method approximately of the aggregate value of the intangible asset will be amortized within six year goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible asset acquired and is attributable primarily to expected synergy economy of scale and the assembled workforce of csra approximately of this goodwill is pre acquisition goodwill deductible for income tax purpose over it remaining tax life csra operating result have been included with our reported result since the acquisition date we immediately began integrating csra with gdit following the acquisition it is becoming increasingly difficult to separate the result of legacy csra from those of the combined entity approximately billion of revenue of operating earnings and of pretax earnings from legacy csra were included in our consolidated statement of earnings in these amount exclude amortization of intangible asset and acquisition financing in addition we have recognized approximately of one time acquisition related cost reported in operating cost and expense and other income expense in the consolidated statement of earnings forma information unaudited the following pro forma information present our consolidated revenue and earnings from continuing operation if the acquisition of csra and the related financing transaction had occurred on january year ended december from continuing earnings per share from continuing operation pro forma information wa prepared by combining our reported historical result with the historical result of csra for the pre acquisition period in addition the reported historical amount were adjusted for the following item net of associated tax effect the impact of acquisition financing the removal of certain csra operation we were required by government customer to dispose of to address an organizational conflict of interest with respect to service provided to the customer we completed the sale of these operation in the removal of csra historical pre acquisition intangible asset amortization expense and debt related interest expense the impact of intangible asset amortization expense assuming our current estimate of fair value wa applied on january the payment of acquisition related cost assuming they were incurred on january the pro forma information is based on the preliminary amount allocated to the estimated fair value of net asset acquired and may be revised the provisional amount change the pro forma information doe not reflect the realization of expected cost saving or synergy from the acquisition and doe not reflect what our combined result of operation would have been had the acquisition occurred on january other acquisition and divestituresin addition to the acquisition of csra we acquired five business in for an aggregate of approximately hawker pacific leading provider of integrated aviation solution across asia pacific and the middle east and two fixed

for an aggregate of approximately an aircraft management and charter service provider in our aerospace segment and manufacturer of unmanned underwater vehicle in our mission system segment operating result of these acquisition have been included with our reported result since the respective closing date the purchase price of the acquisition have been allocated to the estimated fair value of net tangible and intangible asset acquired with any excess purchase price recorded goodwill in we completed the sale of three business in our information technology segment commercial health product

respectively discussed above consists primarily of adjustment for foreign currency translation activity in the nine month period ended december also includes an allocation of goodwill in our information technology reporting unit associated with certain operation classified held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet on december concurrent with the acquisition of csra we reorganized our information system and technology operating segment into the information technology and mission system segment see note for further discussion of the segment reorganization this reorganization similarly changed the composition of our reporting unit accordingly goodwill of the information system and technology reporting unit wa reassigned to the information technology and mission system

intangible asset expense is included in operating cost and expense in the consolidated statement of earnings amortization expense wa in in and in we expect to record annual amortization expense over the next five year follows year ended december revenuethe majority of our revenue is derived from long term contract and program that can span several year we account for revenue in accordance with accounting standard codification asc topic revenue from contract with customer performance obligation performance obligation is promise in contract to transfer distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account in asc topic contract transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation within that contract and recognized revenue when or the performance obligation is satisfied the majority of our contract have single performance obligation the promise to transfer the individual good or service is not separately identifiable from other promise in the contract and is therefore not distinct some of our contract have multiple obligation most commonly due to the contract covering multiple phase of the product lifecycle development production maintenance and support for contract with multiple performance obligation we allocate the contract transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract the primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus margin approach under which we forecast our expected cost of satisfying performance obligation and then add an appropriate margin for that distinct good or service contract modification are routine in the performance of our contract contract are often modified to account for change in contract specification or requirement in most instance contract modification are for good or service that are not distinct and therefore are accounted for part of the existing contract our performance obligation are satisfied over time work progress or at point in time revenue from product and service transferred to customer over time accounted for of our revenue in in and in substantially all of our revenue in the defense segment is recognized over time because control is transferred continuously to our customer typically revenue is recognized over time using cost incurred to date relative to total estimated cost at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligation incurred cost represents work performed which corresponds with and thereby best depicts the transfer of control to the customer contract cost include labor material overhead and when appropriate expense revenue from good and service transferred to customer at point in time accounted for of our revenue in in and in the majority of our revenue recognized at point in time is for the manufacture of business jet aircraft in our aerospace segment revenue on these contract is recognized when the customer obtains control of the asset which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the fully outfitted aircraft on december we had billion of remaining performance obligation which we also refer to total backlog we expect to recognize approximately of our remaining performance obligation revenue in an additional by and the balance thereafter on december we had billion of remaining performance obligation at which time we expected to recognize approximately of these remaining performance obligation revenue in an additional by year end and the balance thereafter contract estimate accounting for long term contract and program involves the use of various technique to estimate total contract revenue and cost for long term contract we estimate the profit on contract the difference between the total estimated revenue and expected cost to complete contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract contract estimate are based on various assumption to project the outcome of future event that often span several year these assumption include labor productivity and availability the complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of material the performance of subcontractor and the availability and timing of funding from the customer the nature of our contract give rise to several type of variable consideration including claim and award and incentive fee we include in our contract estimate additional revenue for submitted contract modification or claim against the customer when we believe we have an enforceable right to the modification or claim the amount can be estimated reliably and it realization is probable in evaluating these criterion we consider the contractual legal basis for the claim the cause of any additional cost incurred the reasonableness of those cost and the objective evidence available to support the claim we include or incentive fee in the estimated transaction price when there is basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee these estimate are based on historical award experience anticipated performance and our best judgment at the time because of our certainty in estimating these amount they are included in the transaction price of our contract and the associated remaining performance obligation significant change in one or more of these estimate could affect the profitability of our contract we review and update our contract related estimate regularly we recognize adjustment in estimated profit on contract under the cumulative catch up method under this method the impact of the adjustment on profit recorded to date on contract is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified revenue and profit in future period of contract performance are recognized using the adjusted estimate if at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on the contract we recognize the total loss in the period it is identified the impact of adjustment in contract estimate on our operating earnings can be reflected in either operating cost and expense or revenue the aggregate impact of adjustment in contract estimate increased our revenue operating earnings and diluted earnings per share follows year ended december earnings per share no adjustment on any one contract wa material to our consolidated financial statement in or the amount in wa negatively impacted by loss on the design and development phase of the ajax program in our combat system segment and cost growth associated with the restart of the navy ddg program in our marine system segment revenue by category our portfolio of product and service consists of approximately active contract the following series of table present our revenue disaggregated by several category by major product and service wa follows year ended december manufacturing and completion owned system armament and and other combat information mission powered and other marine revenue by contract type wa follows year ended december combat system information technology mission system marine system totalrevenuefixed price reimbursement and revenue ended december fixed price reimbursement and revenue ended december fixed price reimbursement and revenue segment operate under fixed price cost reimbursement and time and material contract our production contract are primarily fixed price under these contract we agree to perform specific scope of work for fixed amount contract for research engineering repair and maintenance and other service are typically cost reimbursement or time and material under cost reimbursement contract the customer reimburses contract cost incurred and pay fixed incentive or award based fee these fee are determined by our ability to achieve target set in the contract such cost quality schedule and performance under and material contract the customer pay fixed hourly rate for direct labor and generally reimburses for the cost of material each of these contract type present advantage and disadvantage typically we assume more risk with fixed price contract however these type of contract offer additional profit when we complete the work for le than originally estimated cost reimbursement contract generally subject to lower risk accordingly the associated base fee are usually lower than fee earned on fixed price contract under time and material contract our profit may vary if actual labor hour rate vary significantly from the negotiated rate also because these contract can provide little or no fee for managing material cost the content mix can impact profitability revenue by customer wa follows year ended december combat system information technology mission system marine system

recognition billing and cash collection result in billed account receivable unbilled receivables contract asset and customer advance and deposit contract liability on the consolidated balance sheet in our defense segment amount are billed work progress in accordance with agreed upon contractual term either at periodic interval biweekly or monthly or upon achievement of contractual milestone generally billing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition resulting in contract asset however we sometimes receive advance or deposit from our customer particularly on our international contract before revenue is recognized resulting in contract liability these asset and liability are reported on the consolidated balance sheet on contract by contract basis at the end of each reporting period in our aerospace segment we generally receive deposit from customer upon contract execution and upon achievement of contractual milestone these deposit are liquidated when revenue is recognized change in the contract asset and liability balance during the year ended december were not materially impacted by any other factor except for the acquisition of csra in our information technology segment further discussed in note and the delay in payment on an international wheeled armored vehicle contract in our combat system segment further discussed in note revenue recognized in and that wa included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of each year wa billion billion and billion respectively this revenue represented primarily the sale of business jet aircraft earnings per sharewe compute basic earnings per share eps using net earnings for the period and the weighted average number of common share outstanding during the period basic weighted average share outstanding

sell an asset or paid to transfer liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between marketplace participant various valuation approach can be used to determine

designated fair value or net investment hedge on december or foreign currency financial statement translation we translate foreign currency balance sheet from our international business functional currency generally the respective local currency to dollar at the end of period exchange rate and statement of earnings at the average exchange rate for each period the resulting foreign currency

official for the department of the navy issued show cause letter to electric boat requesting that electric boat respond to the official concern regarding electric boat oversight and management with respect to it quality assurance system for subcontractor and supplier electric boat responded to the show cause letter and ha been engaged in discussion with the government given the current status of these matter we are unable to express view regarding the ultimate outcome or if the outcome is adverse to estimate an amount or range of reasonably possible loss depending on the outcome of these matter there could be material impact on our result of operation financial condition and cash flow additionally various other claim and legal proceeding incidental to the normal course of business are pending or threatened against these other matter relate to such issue government investigation and claim the protection of the environment asbestos related claim and employee related matter the nature of litigation is such that we can not predict the outcome of these other matter however based on information currently available we believe any potential liability in these other proceeding individually or in the aggregate will not have material impact on our result of operation financial condition or cash flow environmentalwe are subject to and affected by variety of federal state local and foreign environmental law and regulation we are directly or indirectly involved in environmental investigation or remediation at some of our current and former facility and third party site that we do not own but where we have been designated potentially responsible party prp by the environmental protection agency or state environmental agency based on historical experience we expect that significant percentage of the total remediation and compliance cost associated with these facility will continue to be allowable contract cost and therefore recoverable under government contract required we provide financial assurance for certain site undergoing or subject to investigation or remediation we accrue environmental cost when it is probable that liability ha been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated where applicable we seek insurance recovery for cost related to environmental liability we do not record insurance recovery before collection is considered probable based on all known fact and analysis we do not believe that our liability at any individual site or in the aggregate arising from such environmental condition will be material to our result of operation financial condition or cash flow we also do not believe that the range of reasonably possible additional loss beyond what ha been recorded would be material to our result of operation

in the scope of work while we are entitled to recovery of these cost under our contract the administrative process with our customer may be protracted based on the circumstance we periodically file

expense related to stock option on straight line basis over the vesting period of the award net of estimated forfeiture estimated forfeiture are based on our historical forfeiture experience we estimate the fair value of stock option on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following assumption for each of the past three year year ended december weighted average expected expected term in month free interest expected dividend we determine the above assumption based on the following expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over period equal to the expected term of the option expected term is based on assumption used by set of comparable peer company risk free interest rate is the yield on treasury zero coupon issue with remaining term equal to the expected term of the option at the grant date expected dividend yield is based on our historical dividend yield the resulting weighted average fair value per

benefit pension and other post retirement benefit substantially all of our plan use december measurement date consistent with our fiscal year the following discussion reflects the inclusion of legacy csra plan assumed in connection with the acquisition of the acquisition date retirement plan summary informationdefined contribution benefit we provide eligible employee the opportunity to participate in defined contribution saving plan commonly known plan which permit contribution on before tax and after tax basis employee may contribute to various investment alternative in most of these plan we match portion of the employee contribution our contribution to these plan totaled in in and in the defined contribution plan held approximately million share of our common stock representing approximately of our outstanding share on december and pension benefit we have ten noncontributory and five contributory trusteed qualified defined benefit pension plan covering eligible government business employee and two noncontributory and four contributory plan covering eligible commercial business employee including some employee of our international operation the primary factor affecting the benefit earned by participant in our pension plan are employee year of service and compensation level our primary government pension plan which comprise the majority of our unfunded obligation were closed to new salaried participant on january additionally we made change to these plan for certain participant effective in that limit or cease the benefit that accrue for future service we made similar change to our primary commercial pension plan in we also sponsor one funded and several unfunded non qualified supplemental executive retirement plan which provide participant with additional benefit including excess benefit over limit imposed on qualified plan by federal tax law other post retirement benefit we maintain plan that provide post retirement healthcare and life insurance coverage for certain employee and retiree these benefit vary by employment status age service and salary level at retirement the coverage provided and the extent to which the retiree share in the cost of the program vary throughout the company the plan provide health and life insurance benefit to those employee who retire directly from our service and not to those who terminate service prior to eligibility for retirement contribution and benefit paymentsit is our policy to fund our defined benefit retirement plan in manner that optimizes the tax deductibility and contract recovery of contribution considered within our capital deployment framework therefore we may make discretionary contribution in addition to the required contribution determined in accordance with irs regulation in in addition to our required contribution of approximately we made discretionary contribution of resulting in total pension plan contribution of approximately in the additional contribution wa considered to be significant event in accordance with asc topic and therefore triggered remeasurement of the net periodic defined benefit pension cost in our required contribution are approximately we maintain several tax advantaged account primarily voluntary employee beneficiary association veba trust to fund the obligation for some of our other post retirement benefit plan for non funded plan claim are paid received contribution to our other post retirement benefit plan were not material in and are not expected to be material in we expect the following benefit to be paid from our retirement plan over the next year pensionbenefits other post contract considerationsour contractual arrangement with the government provide for the recovery of contribution to our pension and other post retirement benefit plan covering employee working in our defense segment for non funded plan our government contract allow to recover claim paid following payment these recoverable amount are allocated to contract and billed to the customer in accordance with the cost accounting standard ca and specific contractual term for some of these plan the cumulative pension and other post retirement benefit cost exceeds the amount currently allocable to contract to the extent we consider recovery of the cost to be probable based on our backlog and probable follow on contract we defer the excess in other contract cost in other current asset on the consolidated balance sheet until the cost is allocable to contract see note for discussion of our other contract cost for other plan the amount allocated to contract and included in revenue ha exceeded the plan cumulative benefit cost we have similarly deferred recognition of these excess earnings on the consolidated balance sheet defined benefit retirement plan summary financial informationestimating retirement plan asset liability and cost requires the extensive use of actuarial assumption these include the long term rate of return on plan asset the interest rate used to discount projected benefit payment healthcare cost trend rate and future salary increase given the long term nature of the assumption being made actual outcome can and often do differ from these estimate annual benefit cost consists of three primary element the cost of benefit earned by employee for service rendered during the year an interest charge on our plan liability and an assumed return on our plan asset for the year the annual cost also includes gain and loss resulting from change in actuarial assumption difference between the actual and assumed long term rate of return on asset and gain and loss resulting from change we make to plan benefit term we recognize an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheet equal to the funded status of each of our defined benefit retirement plan the funded status is the difference between the fair value of the plan asset and it benefit obligation change in plan asset and liability due to difference between actuarial assumption and the actual result of the plan are deferred in aocl rather than charged to earnings these difference are then amortized over future year component of our annual benefit cost we amortize actuarial difference under qualified plan on straight line basis over the average remaining service period of eligible employee if all of plan participant are inactive or are not accruing additional benefit we amortize these difference over the average remaining life expectancy of the plan participant we recognize the difference between the actual and expected return on plan asset for qualified plan over five year the deferral of these difference reduces the volatility of our annual benefit cost that can result either from year to year change in the assumption or from actual result that are not necessarily representative of the long term financial position of these plan we recognize difference under nonqualified plan immediately net annual

about future compensation level the abo for all defined benefit pension plan wa billion and billion on december and respectively on december and some of our pension plan had an abo that exceeded the plan asset summary information for those plan follows december abo fair value of plan plan assumptionswe calculate the plan asset and liability for given year and the net annual benefit cost for the subsequent year using assumption determined of december of the year in question following table summarizes the weighted average assumption used to determine our benefit obligation assumption on december benefit benefit obligation discount rate of increase in compensation other post retirement benefit benefit obligation discount healthcare cost trend rate trend rate for next ultimate trend year rate reach ultimate trend following table summarizes the weighted average assumption used to determine our net annual benefit cost assumption for year ended december benefit discount rate benefit service interest expected long term rate of return on rate of increase in compensation other post retirement benefit discount rate benefit service interest expected long term rate of return on we base the discount rate on current yield curve developed from portfolio of high quality fixed income investment with maturity consistent with the projected benefit payout period we use the spot rate approach to identify individual spot rate along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each projected service cost and discounted benefit obligation payment we determine the long term rate of return on asset based on consideration of historical and forward looking return and the current and expected asset allocation strategy in we decreased the expected long term rate of return on asset in our primary government and commercial pension plan by basis point following an assessment of the historical and expected long term return of our various asset class beginning in we will decrease the expected long term rate of return on asset in our primary other post retirement benefit plan by basis point following an assessment of the historical and expected long term return of our various asset class this decrease is not expected to have material impact on our benefit cost retirement plan assumption are based on our best judgment including consideration of current and future market
