incur higher than anticipated credit loss result of dispute with counterparties over the valuation of collateral or ii action taken by other lender that may negatively impact the valuation of collateral in case where we foreclose on collateral sudden decline in the value or liquidity of collateral may result in significant loss to despite our credit monitoring ii over collateralization iii ability to call for additional collateral or iv ability to force repayment of the underlying obligation especially where there is single type of collateral supporting the obligation in addition in the longer term climate change may have negative impact on the financial condition of our client which may decrease revenue from those client and increase the credit risk associated with loan and other credit exposure to those client certain of our credit exposure may be concentrated by counterparty product industry or country although our model and estimate account for correlation among related

and complexity significantly affect the way and cost of business and can restrict the scope of our existing business and limit our ability to expand our product offering and pursue certain investment the firm and it employee are subject to wide ranging regulation and supervision which among other thing subject to intensive scrutiny of our business and any plan for expansion of those business

greater risk of loss for our security holder and subject to other restriction we are required to submit once every two year to the federal reserve and the fdic resolution plan that describes our strategy for rapid and orderly resolution under the bankruptcy code in the event of material financial distress or failure if the federal reserve and the fdic were to jointly determine that our resolution plan submission wa not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution and if december form of content we were unsuccessful in addressing any deficiency identified by the regulator we or any of our subsidiary may be subject to more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirement or restriction on our growth activity or operation or after two year period we may be required to divest asset or operation in addition provided that certain procedure are met we can be subject to resolution proceeding under the orderly liquidation authority under title ii of the dodd frank act with the fdic being appointed receiver instead of being resolved under the bankruptcy code the fdic power under the orderly liquidation authority to disregard the priority of creditor claim and treat similarly situated creditor differently in certain circumstance subject to certain limitation could adversely impact holder of our unsecured debt see business supervision and regulation and management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation liquidity and capital resource regulatory requirement further because both our resolution plan contemplates an spoe strategy under the bankruptcy code and the fdic ha proposed an spoe strategy through which it may apply it orderly liquidation authority power we believe that the application of an spoe strategy is the reasonably likely outcome if either our resolution plan were implemented or resolution proceeding were commenced under the orderly liquidation authority an spoe strategy generally contemplates the provision of adequate capital and liquidity by the parent company to certain of it subsidiary so that such subsidiary have the resource necessary to implement the resolution strategy and the parent company ha entered into secured amended and restated support agreement with such entity pursuant to which it would provide such capital and liquidity to such entity in addition wholly owned direct subsidiary of the parent company morgan stanley holding llc funding ihc serf resolution funding vehicle the parent company ha transferred and ha agreed to transfer on an ongoing basis certain asset to the funding ihc in the event of resolution scenario the parent company would be obligated to contribute all of it material asset that can be contributed under the term of the amended and restated support agreement other than share in subsidiary of the parent company and certain other asset to the funding ihc the funding ihc would be obligated to provide capital and liquidity applicable to certain supported subsidiary pursuant to the term of the secured amended and restated support agreement the obligation of the parent company and of the funding ihc respectively under the amended and restated support agreement are in most case secured on senior basis by the asset of the parent company other than share in subsidiary of the parent company and certain other asset and the asset of the funding ihc applicable result claim of certain supported subsidiary including the funding ihc against the asset of the parent company with respect to such secured asset are effectively senior to unsecured obligation of the parent company although an spoe strategy whether applied pursuant to our resolution plan or in resolution proceeding under the orderly liquidation authority is intended to result in better outcome for creditor overall there is no guarantee that the application of an spoe strategy including the provision of support to the parent company supported subsidiary pursuant to the secured amended and restated support agreement will not result in greater loss for holder of our security compared with different resolution strategy for regulator have taken and proposed various action to facilitate an spoe strategy under the bankruptcy code the orderly liquidation authority and other resolution regime for example the federal reserve requires top tier bhcs of sib including the firm to maintain adequate tlac including equity and eligible long term debt in order to ensure that such institution have enough loss absorbing resource at the point of failure to be recapitalized through the conversion of debt to equity or otherwise by imposing loss on eligible tlac where the spoe strategy is used the combined implication of the spoe resolution strategy and the tlac requirement is that our loss will be imposed on the holder of eligible long term debt and other form of eligible tlac issued by the parent company before any loss are imposed on the creditor of our supported subsidiary without requiring taxpayer or government financial support in addition certain jurisdiction including the and jurisdiction have implemented or are in the process of implementing change to resolution regime to provide resolution authority with the ability to recapitalize failing entity organized in such jurisdiction by writing certain unsecured liability or converting certain unsecured liability into equity such bail in power are intended to enable the recapitalization of failing institution by allocating loss to it shareholder and unsecured creditor this may increase the overall level of capital and liquidity required by on consolidated basis and may result in limitation on our ability to efficiently distribute capital and liquidity among our affiliated entity including in time of stress non regulator are also considering requirement that certain subsidiary of large financial institution maintain minimum amount of tlac that would pas loss up from the subsidiary to the parent company and ultimately to security holder of the parent company in the event of failure we may be prevented from paying dividend or taking other capital action because of regulatory constraint or revised regulatory capital requirement we are subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision regulation and examination by the federal reserve including with respect to regulatory capital requirement stress testing and capital planning we submit on at least an annual basis capital plan to the federal reserve describing proposed form ktable of content dividend payment to shareholder proposed repurchase of our outstanding security and other proposed capital action that we intend to take our ability to take capital action described in the capital plan is dependent on among other factor the result of supervisory stress test conducted by the federal reserve and our compliance with regulatory capital requirement imposed by the federal reserve in addition the federal reserve may change regulatory capital requirement to impose higher requirement that restrict our ability to take capital action or may modify or impose other regulatory standard or restriction that increase our operating expense or constrain our ability to take capital action for additional information see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation

note to the financial statement failure to address conflict of interest appropriately could adversely affect our business and reputation global financial service firm that provides product and service to large and diversified group of client including corporation government financial institution and individual we face potential conflict of interest in the normal course of business for example potential conflict can occur when there is divergence of interest between and client among client between an employee on the one hand and or client on the other or situation in which we may be creditor of client moreover we utilize multiple brand and business channel including those resulting from our acquisition and continue to enhance the collaboration across business segment which may heighten the potential conflict of interest or the risk of improper sharing of information we have policy procedure and control that are designed to identify and address potential conflict of interest and we utilize various measure such the use of disclosure to manage these potential conflict however identifying and mitigating potential conflict of interest can be complex and challenging and can become the focus of medium and regulatory scrutiny indeed action that merely appear to december form of content create conflict can put our reputation at risk even if the likelihood of an actual conflict ha been mitigated it is possible that potential conflict could give rise to litigation or enforcement action which may lead to our client being le willing to enter into transaction in which conflict may occur and could adversely affect our business and reputation our regulator also have the ability to scrutinize our activity for potential conflict of interest including through detailed examination of specific transaction for example our status bhc supervised by the federal reserve subject to direct federal reserve scrutiny with respect to transaction between our bank subsidiary and their affiliate further the volcker rule subject to regulatory scrutiny regarding certain transaction between and our client risk managementour risk management strategy model and process may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environment or against all type of risk which could result in unexpected loss we have devoted significant resource to develop our risk management capability and expect to continue to do so in the future nonetheless our risk management strategy model and process including our use of various risk model for assessing market credit liquidity and operational exposure and hedging strategy stress testing and other analysis may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environment or against all type of risk including risk that are unidentified or unanticipated our business change and grow including through acquisition and the market in which we operate evolve our risk management strategy model and process may not always adapt with those change some of our method of managing risk are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior and management judgment result these method may not predict future risk exposure which could be significantly greater than the historical measure indicate in addition many model we use are based on assumption or input regarding correlation among price of various asset class or other market indicator and therefore can not anticipate sudden unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movement such the impact of pandemic or sudden geopolitical conflict which could cause to incur loss management of market credit liquidity operational model legal regulatory and compliance risk requires among other thing policy and procedure to record properly and verify large number of transaction and event and these policy and procedure may not be fully effective our trading risk management strategy and technique also seek to balance our ability to profit from trading position with our exposure to potential loss while we employ broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation technique those technique and the judgment that accompany their application can not anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the timing of such outcome for example to the extent that our trading or investing activity involve le liquid trading market or are otherwise subject to restriction on sale or hedging we may not be able to reduce our position and therefore reduce our risk associated with such position we may therefore incur loss in the course of our trading or investing activity for more information on how we monitor and manage market and certain other risk and related strategy model and process see quantitative and qualitative disclosure about risk market risk climate change manifesting physical or transition risk could result in increased cost and risk and adversely affect our operation business and client there continues to be increasing concern over the risk of climate change and related environmental sustainability matter the physical risk of climate change include harm to people and property arising from acute climate related event such flood hurricane heatwaves wildfire and chronic longer term shift in climate pattern such higher global average temperature rising sea level and drought such event could disrupt our operation or those of our client or third party on which we rely including through direct damage to physical asset and indirect impact from supply chain disruption and market volatility over the longer term these event could impact the ability of certain of our client or customer to repay their obligation reduce the value of collateral limit insurance coverage and result in other effect additionally transitioning to low carbon economy will likely require extensive policy legal technology and market change transition risk including change in consumer and business sentiment related technology shareholder preference and any additional regulatory and legislative requirement including carbon tax could increase our expense and adversely impact our strategy including by limiting our ability to pursue certain business activity or offer certain product and service over the longer term negative impact to certain of our client such decreased profitability and stranded asset could also lead to increased credit and counterparty risk to in addition our reputation and client relationship may be adversely impacted result of our practice related to climate change including our involvement or our client involvement in certain industry project or initiative associated with causing or potentially slowing solution to climate change well any decision we make to continue to conduct or change our activity in response to consideration relating to climate change legislative or form ktable of content regulatory uncertainty and change regarding climate related risk including inconsistent perspective or requirement are likely to result in higher regulatory compliance credit reputational and other risk and cost our ability to achieve our long term climate related goal and commitment could also result in reputational harm result of public sentiment regulatory scrutiny litigation and reduced investor and stakeholder confidence if we are unable to achieve our objective relating to climate change or our current response to climate change is perceived to be ineffective or insufficient our business and reputation may suffer the risk associated with and the perspective of regulator government shareholder employee and other stakeholder regarding climate change are continuing to evolve rapidly which can make it difficult to ass the ultimate impact on of climate change related risk and uncertainty climate risk is interconnected with other risk type including geopolitical risk we have developed and continue to enhance process to embed climate risk consideration into our risk management strategy for risk such market credit and operational risk well our governance structure despite our risk management strategy the unpredictability surrounding the timing and severity of climate change event and societal or political change in reaction to them make it difficult to predict identify monitor and effectively mitigate climate risk exposure in addition the methodology and data used to manage and monitor climate risk are still in early stage and continue to evolve current approach utilize information and estimate that have been derived from information or factor released by third party source which may not reflect the latest or most accurate data climate related data particularly greenhouse gas emission for client and counterparties remains limited in availability and variable in quality certain third party information may also change over time methodology evolve and are refined while we believe this information is the best available at the time we may only be able to complete limited validation furthermore modeling capability and methodology to analyze climate related risk although improving remain nascent and emerging these and other factor could cause result to differ materially from those expressed in the estimate and belief made by third party and by which could also impact our management of risk in this area replacement of london interbank offered rate and replacement or reform of other interest rate benchmark could adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation central bank around the world including the federal reserve have sponsored initiative in recent year to replace libor and replace or reform certain other interest rate benchmark collectively the ibors transition away from use of the ibors to alternative rate and other potential interest rate benchmark reform is underway and is multi year initiative these reform have caused and may in the future cause such rate to perform differently than in the past or to cease entirely or have other consequence that are contrary to market expectation the ongoing market transition away from ibors and other interest rate benchmark to alternative reference rate is complex and could have range of adverse impact on our business financial condition and result of operation in particular such transition or reform could

financing receivables measured at amortized cost we adopted this update on prospective basis and noted no impact on our financial condition or result of operation upon adoption we are currently evaluating the following accounting update however we do not expect material impact on our financial condition or result of operation upon adoption fair value measurement this accounting update clarifies that contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and therefore is not considered in measuring fair value the update also requires additional disclosure including the fair value of equity security subject to contractual sale restriction the nature and remaining duration of the restriction and circumstance that could cause the restriction to lapse the asu is effective january with early adoption permitted critical accounting estimatesour financial statement are prepared in accordance with gaap which requires to make estimate and assumption see note to the financial statement we believe that of our significant accounting policy see note to the financial statement the following policy involve higher degree of judgment and complexity fair valuefinancial instrument measured at fair valuea significant number of our financial instrument are carried at fair value the use of fair value to measure financial instrument is fundamental to our risk management practice and is our most critical accounting estimate we make estimate regarding the valuation of asset and liability measured at fair value in preparing the financial statement these asset and liability include but are not limited to december form of content management discussion and analysis trading asset and trading liability investment security afs certain security purchased under agreement to resell loan held for sale measured at the lower of amortized cost or fair value certain deposit primarily certificate of deposit certain security sold under agreement to repurchase certain other secured financing and certain borrowing fair value is defined the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer liability the exit price in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date in determining fair value we use various valuation approach hierarchy for input is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable price and input and minimizes the use of unobservable price and input by requiring that the relevant observable input be used when available the hierarchy is broken down into three level wherein level represents quoted price in active market level represents valuation based on quoted price in market that are not active or for which all significant input are observable and level consists of valuation technique that incorporate significant unobservable input and therefore require the greatest use of judgment the fair value for the substantial majority of our financial asset and liability carried at fair value are based on observable price and input and are classified in level or of the fair value hierarchy level financial asset represented and of our total asset of december and december respectively in period of market disruption the observability of price and input well market liquidity may be reduced for many instrument which could cause an instrument to be recategorized from level to level or from level to level in addition downturn in market condition could lead to decline in the valuation of many instrument carried at fair value imprecision in estimating unobservable market input or other factor can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for particular position the firm us various methodology and assumption in the determination of fair value the use of methodology or assumption different than those used by the firm could result in different estimate of fair value at the reporting date for further information on the definition of fair value level level level and related valuation technique and quantitative information about and sensitivity of significant unobservable input used in level fair value measurement see note and to the financial statement where appropriate valuation adjustment are made to account for various factor such liquidity risk bid ask adjustment credit quality model uncertainty concentration risk and funding in order to arrive at fair value for further discussion of valuation adjustment that we apply see note to the financial statement goodwill and intangible assetsgoodwillwe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis of july and on an interim basis when certain event or circumstance exist evaluating goodwill for impairment requires management to make significant judgment including in part the use of unobservable input that are subject to uncertainty goodwill impairment test are performed at the reporting unit level which is generally at the level of or one level below our business segment goodwill no longer retains it association with particular acquisition once it ha been assigned to reporting unit such all the activity of reporting unit whether acquired or organically developed are available to support the value of the goodwill for both the annual and interim test we have the option to either perform quantitative impairment test or ii first perform qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount in which case the quantitative test would be performed when performing quantitative impairment test we compare the fair value of reporting unit with it carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit is le than it carrying amount the goodwill impairment loss is equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value limited by the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit the carrying value of each reporting unit is determined based on the capital allocated to the reporting unit the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is derived based on valuation technique we believe market participant would use for each of the reporting unit the estimated fair value is generally determined by utilizing discounted cash flow methodology in certain instance we may also utilize methodology that incorporate price to book and price to earnings multiple of certain comparable company the discounted cash flow methodology us projected future cash flow based on the reporting unit earnings forecast the discount rate used represents an estimate of the cost of equity for that reporting unit based on the capital asset pricing model at each annual goodwill impairment testing date each of our reporting unit with goodwill had fair value that wa substantially in excess of it carrying value intangible assetsintangible asset are initially recorded at cost or in the situation where acquired

where amortization is recognized over their estimated useful life form ktable of content management discussion and analysisindefinite lived intangible asset are not amortized but are tested for impairment on an annual basis of july and on an interim basis when certain event or circumstance exist on quarterly basis all intangible asset are assessed for the presence of impairment indicator where such indicator are present an evaluation for impairment is conducted for amortizable intangible asset an impairment loss exists if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds it fair value the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flow for indefinite lived intangible asset an impairment exists if the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds it fair value amortizable intangible asset are assessed for any indication that the remaining useful life or the finite life classification should be revised in such case the remaining carrying amount is amortized prospectively over the revised useful life unless it is determined that the life of the intangible asset is indefinite in which case the intangible asset is not amortized indefinite lived intangible asset are assessed for any indication that the life of the intangible asset is no longer indefinite in such case the carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over it remaining useful life the initial valuation of an intangible asset part of the acquisition method of accounting and the subsequent valuation of intangible asset part of an impairment assessment are subjective and based in part on input that are unobservable and can be subject to uncertainty these input include but are not limited to forecasted cash flow revenue growth rate customer attrition rate and discount rate for both goodwill and intangible asset to the extent an impairment loss is recognized the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset subsequent reversal of impairment loss is not permitted for amortizable intangible asset the new cost basis is amortized over the remaining useful life of

estimated loss by charge to income in many proceeding and investigation however it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible or to estimate the amount of any loss in addition even where loss is possible or an exposure to loss exists in excess of the liability already accrued with respect to previously recognized loss contingency it is not always possible to reasonably estimate the size of the possible loss or range of loss particularly for proceeding and investigation where the factual record is being developed or contested or where plaintiff or

management framework is to ensure that we have access to adequate funding across wide range of market condition and time horizon the framework is designed to enable to fulfill our financial obligation and support the execution of our business strategy the following principle guide our liquidity risk management framework sufficient liquidity resource should be maintained to cover maturing liability and other planned and contingent outflow maturity profile of asset and liability should be aligned with limited reliance on short term funding source counterparty currency region and term of funding should be diversified and liquidity stress test should anticipate and account for period of limited access to funding the core component of our liquidity risk management framework are the required liquidity framework liquidity stress test and liquidity resource which support our target liquidity profile required liquidity frameworkour required liquidity framework establishes the amount of liquidity we must hold in both normal and stressed environment to ensure that our financial condition and overall soundness are not adversely affected by an inability or perceived inability to meet our financial obligation in timely manner the required liquidity framework considers the most constraining liquidity requirement to satisfy all regulatory and internal limit at consolidated and legal entity level liquidity stress testswe use liquidity stress test to model external and intercompany liquidity flow across multiple scenario and range of time horizon these scenario contain various combination of idiosyncratic and systemic stress event of different severity and duration the methodology implementation production and analysis of our liquidity stress test are important component of the required liquidity framework the assumption used in our various liquidity stress test scenario include but are not limited to the following no government support no access to equity and limited access to unsecured debt market repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within the stress horizon higher haircut for and significantly lower availability of secured funding additional collateral that would be required by trading counterparties certain exchange and clearing organization related to credit rating downgrade additional collateral that would be required due to collateral substitution collateral dispute and uncalled collateral discretionary unsecured debt buyback drawdowns on lending commitment provided to third party and client cash withdrawal and reduction in customer short position that fund long position liquidity stress test are produced and result are reported at different level including major operating subsidiary and major currency to capture specific cash requirement and cash availability across the firm including limited number of asset sale in stressed environment the liquidity stress test assume that subsidiary will use their liquidity first to fund their obligation before drawing liquidity from the parent company and that the parent company will support it subsidiary and will not have access to subsidiary liquidity reserve in addition to the assumption underpinning the liquidity stress test we take into consideration settlement risk related to intraday settlement and clearing of security and financing activity at december and december we maintained sufficient liquidity resource to meet current and contingent funding obligation modeled in our liquidity stress test december form of content management discussion and analysisliquidity resourceswe maintain sufficient liquidity resource which consist of hqla and cash deposit with bank liquidity resource to cover daily funding need and to meet strategic liquidity target sized by the

and composition funding need in stressed environment inclusive of contingent cash outflow legal entity regional and segment liquidity requirement regulatory requirement and collateral requirement the

our risk limit support linkage between the overall risk appetite which is reviewed by the board and more granular risk taking decision and activity risk limit once established are reviewed and updated on at least an annual basis with more frequent update necessary board level risk limit address the most important firmwide aggregation of risk additional risk limit approved by the frc address more specific type of risk and are bound by the higher level board risk limit risk management processin subsequent section we discus our risk management policy and procedure for our primary risk involved in the activity of our institutional security wealth management and investment management business segment these section and the estimated amount of our risk exposure generated by our statistical analysis are forward looking statement however the analysis used to ass such risk are not prediction of future event and actual result may vary significantly from such analysis due to event in the market in which we operate and certain other factor described in the following paragraph market riskmarket risk refers to the risk that change in the level of one or more market price rate spread index volatility correlation or other market factor such market liquidity will result in loss for position or portfolio generally we incur market risk result of trading investing and client facilitation activity principally within the institutional security business segment where the substantial majority of our var for market risk exposure is generated in addition we incur non trading market risk principally within the wealth management and investment management business segment the wealth management business segment primarily incurs non trading market risk including interest rate risk from lending and deposit taking activity the investment management business segment primarily incurs non trading market risk from capital investment in it fund market risk also includes non trading interest rate risk non trading interest rate risk in the banking book amount classified for regulatory capital purpose under the banking book regime refers to the exposure that change in interest rate will result in prospective earnings change for asset and liability in the banking book sound market risk management is an integral part of our culture the various business unit and trading desk are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposure are well managed and prudent the control group help ensure that these risk are measured and closely monitored and are made transparent to senior management the market risk department is responsible for ensuring the transparency of material market risk monitoring compliance with established limit and escalating risk concentration to appropriate senior management to execute these responsibility the market risk department monitor our risk against limit on aggregate risk exposure performs variety of risk analysis routinely report risk summary and maintains our var and scenario analysis system market risk is also monitored through various measure by use of statistic including var and related analytical measure by measure of position size and sensitivity and through routine stress testing which measure the impact on the value of existing portfolio of specified change in market factor and scenario designed by the market risk department in collaboration with the business unit the material risk identified by these process are summarized in report produced by the market risk department that are circulated to and discussed with senior management the frc the brc and the board trading risksprimary market risk exposure and market risk managementwe have exposure to wide range of risk related to interest rate and credit spread equity price foreign exchange rate and commodity price well the associated implied volatility correlation and spread of the global market in which we conduct our trading activity we are exposed to interest rate and credit spread risk result of our market making activity and other trading in interest rate sensitive financial instrument risk arising from change in the level or implied volatility of interest rate the timing of mortgage prepayment the shape of the yield curve and or credit spread the activity from which those exposure arise and the market in which we are active include but are not limited to the following derivative corporate and government debt across both developed and december form of content risk disclosuresemerging market and asset backed debt including mortgage related security we are exposed to equity price correlation and implied volatility risk result of making market in equity security and derivative and maintaining other position including position in non public entity position in non public entity may include but are not limited to exposure to private equity venture capital private partnership real estate fund and other fund such position are le liquid have longer investment horizon and are more difficult to hedge than listed equity we are exposed to foreign exchange rate correlation and implied volatility risk result of making market in foreign currency and foreign currency derivative from maintaining foreign exchange position and from holding non dollar denominated financial instrument we are exposed to commodity price and implied volatility risk result of market making activity in commodity product related primarily to electricity natural gas oil and precious metal commodity exposure are subject to period of high price volatility result of change in supply and demand these change can be caused by weather condition physical production and transportation or geopolitical and other event that affect the available supply and level of demand for these commodity we manage our trading position by employing variety of risk mitigation strategy these strategy include diversification of risk exposure and hedging hedging activity consist of the purchase or sale of position in related security and financial instrument including variety of derivative product future forward swap and option hedging activity may not always provide effective mitigation against trading loss due to difference in the term specific characteristic or other basis risk that may exist between the hedge instrument and the risk exposure that is being hedged we manage the market risk associated with our trading activity on firmwide basis on worldwide trading division level and on an individual product basis we manage and monitor our market risk exposure in such way to maintain portfolio that we believe is well diversified in the aggregate with respect to market risk factor and that reflects our aggregate risk tolerance established by our senior management aggregate market risk limit have been approved for the firm across all division worldwide additional market risk limit are assigned to trading desk and appropriate product and region trading division risk manager desk risk manager trader and the market risk department monitor market risk measure against limit in accordance with policy set by our senior management value at riskthe statistical technique known var is one of the tool we use to measure monitor and review the market risk exposure of our trading portfolio the market risk department calculates and distributes daily var based risk measure to various level of management we estimate var using model based on one year equal weighted historical simulation for general market risk factor and name specific risk in corporate equity and related derivative and monte carlo simulation for name specific risk in bond loan and related derivative the model construct distribution of hypothetical daily change in the value of trading portfolio based on historical observation of daily change in key market index or other market risk factor and information on the sensitivity of the portfolio value to these market risk factor change var for risk management purpose management var is computed at level of confidence over one day time horizon which is useful indicator of possible trading loss resulting from adverse daily market move the one day var corresponds to the unrealized loss in portfolio value that based on historically observed market risk factor movement would have been exceeded with frequency of or five time in every trading day if the portfolio were held constant for one day our var model generally take into account linear and non linear exposure to equity and commodity price risk interest rate risk credit spread risk and foreign exchange rate the model also take into account linear exposure to implied volatility risk for all asset class and non linear exposure to implied volatility risk for equity commodity and foreign exchange referenced product the var model also capture certain implied correlation risk associated with portfolio credit derivative well certain basis risk corporate debt and related credit derivative we use var one of range of risk management tool among their benefit var model permit estimation of portfolio aggregate market risk exposure incorporating range of varied market risk and portfolio asset one key element of the var model is that it reflects risk reduction due to portfolio diversification or hedging activity however var ha various limitation which include but are not limited to use of historical change in market risk factor which may not be accurate predictor of future market condition and may not fully incorporate the risk of extreme market event that are outsized relative to observed historical market behavior or reflect the historical distribution of result beyond the confidence interval and reporting of loss in single day which doe not reflect the risk of position that can not be liquidated or hedged in one day small proportion of market risk generated by trading position is not included in var form ktable of content risk disclosuresthe modeling of the risk characteristic of some position relies on approximation that under certain circumstance could produce significantly different result from those produced using more precise measure var is most appropriate risk measure for trading position in liquid financial market and will understate the risk associated with severe event such period of extreme illiquidity we are aware of these and other limitation and therefore use var only one component in our risk management oversight process this process also incorporates stress testing and scenario analysis and extensive risk monitoring analysis and control at the trading desk division and firm level we update our var model in response to change in the composition of trading portfolio and to improvement in modeling technique and system capability we are committed to continuous review and enhancement of var methodology and assumption in order to capture evolving risk associated with change in market structure and dynamic part of our regular process improvement additional systematic and name specific risk factor may be added to improve the var model ability to more accurately estimate risk to specific asset class or industry sector since the reported var statistic are estimate based on historical data var should not be viewed predictive of our future revenue or financial performance or of our ability to monitor and manage risk there can be no assurance that our actual loss on particular day will not exceed the var amount indicated in the following table or that such loss will not occur more than five time in trading day for one day var var doe not predict the magnitude of loss that should they occur may be significantly greater than the var amount var statistic are not readily comparable across firm because of difference in the firm portfolio modeling assumption and methodology these difference can result in materially different var estimate across firm for similar portfolio the impact of such difference varies depending on the factor history assumption the frequency with which the factor history is updated and the confidence level result var statistic are more useful when interpreted indicator of trend in firm risk profile rather than an absolute measure of risk to be compared across firm our regulator have approved the same var model we use for risk management purpose for use in regulatory calculation the portfolio of position used for management var differs from that used for regulatory var management var contains certain position that are excluded from regulatory var one day management var in rate and credit spread equity foreign exchange commodity le diversification an aprimary risk category credit le diversification an

value for the total management var and each of the component var might have occurred on different day during the quarter and therefore the diversification benefit is not an applicable measure diversification benefit equal the difference between the total var and the sum of the component var this benefit arises because the simulated one day loss for each of the component occur on different day similar diversification benefit also are taken into account within each component average total management var and average management var for the primary risk category increased in from primarily due to increased market volatility in the interest rate and credit spread category well the commodity price category which wa partially offset by increased diversification benefit distribution of var

accordingly we presented net interest income sensitivity for our bank subsidiary however over time the wealth management business segment ha grown it asset that generate net interest income outside of the bank subsidiary such margin and other lending on non bank entity and this growth ha been further accelerated by the acquisition of trade net interest income in the wealth management business

expectation of interest rate and our forecasted business activity we do not manage to any single rate scenario but rather manage net interest income in our wealth management business segment to optimize across range of possible outcome including non parallel rate change scenario the sensitivity analysis assumes that we take no action in response to these scenario assumes there are no change in other macroeconomic variable normally correlated with change in interest rate and includes subjective assumption regarding customer and market re pricing behavior and other factor net interest

to measure certain eligible instrument at fair value including security purchased under agreement to resell loan and lending commitment equity method investment and certain other asset deposit security sold under agreement to repurchase other secured financing and borrowing fair value measurement definition and hierarchyfair value is defined the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer liability the exit price in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date fair value is market based measure considered from the perspective of market participant rather than an entity specific measure therefore even when market assumption are not readily available assumption are set to reflect those that the firm belief market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date where the firm manages group of financial asset financial liability and nonfinancial item accounted for derivative on the basis of it net exposure to either market risk or credit risk the firm measure the fair value of that group of financial instrument consistently with how market participant would price the net risk exposure at the measurement date in determining fair value the firm us various valuation approach and establishes hierarchy for input used in measuring fair value that requires the most observable input be used when available observable input are input that market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability that were developed based on market data obtained from source independent of the form ktable of content note to consolidated financial statementsfirm unobservable input are input that reflect assumption the firm belief other market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability that are developed based on the best information available in the circumstance the fair value hierarchy is broken down into three level based on the observability of input follows with level being the highest and level being the lowest level level valuation based on quoted price in active market that the firm ha the ability to access for identical asset or liability valuation adjustment block discount and discount for entity specific restriction that would not transfer to market participant are not applied to level instrument since valuation are based on quoted price that are readily and regularly available in an active market valuation of these product doe not entail significant degree of judgment level valuation based on one or more quoted price in market that are not active or for which all significant input are observable either directly or indirectly level valuation based on input that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement the availability of observable input can vary from product to product and is affected by wide variety of factor including the type of product whether the product is new and not yet established in the marketplace the liquidity of market and other characteristic particular to the product to the extent that valuation is based on model or input that are le observable or unobservable in the market the determination of fair value requires more judgment accordingly the degree of judgment exercised by the firm in determining fair value is greatest for instrument categorized in level of the fair value hierarchy the firm considers price and input that are current of the measurement date including during period of market dislocation in period of market dislocation the observability of price and input may be reduced for many instrument this condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified from level to level or from level to level of the fair value hierarchy in certain case the input used to measure fair value may fall into different level of the fair value hierarchy in such case the total fair value amount is disclosed in the level appropriate for the lowest level input that is significant to the total fair value of the asset or liability valuation techniquesmany cash instrument and otc derivative contract have bid and ask price that can be observed in the marketplace bid price reflect the highest price that party is willing to pay for an asset ask price represent the lowest price that party is willing to accept for an asset the firm carry position at the point within the bid ask range that meet it best estimate of fair value for offsetting position in the same financial instrument the same price within the bid ask spread is used to measure both the long and short position fair value for many cash instrument and otc derivative contract is derived using pricing model pricing model take into account the contract term well multiple input including where applicable commodity price equity price interest rate yield curve credit curve correlation creditworthiness of the counterparty creditworthiness of the firm option volatility and currency rate where appropriate valuation adjustment are made to account for various factor such liquidity risk bid ask adjustment credit quality model uncertainty and concentration risk and funding in order to arrive at fair value adjustment for liquidity risk adjust model derived mid market amount of level and level financial instrument for the bid mid or mid ask spread required to properly reflect the exit price of risk position bid mid and mid ask spread are marked to level observed in trade activity broker quote or other external third party data where these spread are unobservable for the particular position in question spread are derived from observable level of similar position the firm applies credit related valuation adjustment to it borrowing for which the fair value option wa elected and to otc derivative the firm considers the impact of change in it own credit spread based upon observation of the secondary bond market spread when measuring the fair value for borrowing for otc derivative the impact of change in both the firm and the counterparty credit rating is considered when measuring fair value in determining the expected exposure the firm simulates the distribution of the future exposure to counterparty then applies market based default probability to the future exposure leveraging external third party cd spread data where cd spread data are unavailable for specific counterparty bond market spread cd spread data based on the counterparty credit rating or cd spread data that reference comparable counterparty may be utilized the firm also considers collateral held and legally enforceable master netting agreement that mitigate it exposure to each counterparty adjustment for model uncertainty are taken for position whose underlying model are reliant on significant input that are neither directly indirectly observable hence requiring reliance on established theoretical concept in their derivation these adjustment are derived by making assessment of the possible degree of variability using statistical approach and market based information where possible the firm may apply concentration adjustment to certain of it otc derivative portfolio to reflect the additional cost of closing out particularly large risk exposure where possible these adjustment are based on observable market information but in many instance significant judgment is required to estimate the cost of closing december form of content note to consolidated financial statementsout concentrated risk exposure due to the lack of liquidity in the marketplace the firm applies an fva in the fair value measurement of otc uncollateralized or partially collateralized derivative and in collateralized derivative where the term of the agreement do not permit the reuse of the collateral received in general fva reflects market funding risk premium inherent in the noted derivative instrument the methodology for measuring fva leverage the firm existing credit related valuation adjustment calculation methodology which apply to both asset and liability see note for description of valuation technique applied to the major category of financial instrument measured at fair value asset and liability measured at fair value on non recurring basiscertain of the firm asset and liability are measured at fair value on non recurring basis the firm incurs loss or gain for any adjustment of these asset or liability to fair value for asset and liability measured at fair value on non recurring basis fair value is determined by using various valuation approach the same hierarchy for input described above which requires that observable input be used when available is used in measuring fair value for these item for further information on financial asset and liability that are measured at fair value on recurring and non recurring basis see note offsetting of derivative instrumentsin connection with it derivative activity the firm generally enters into master netting agreement and collateral agreement with it counterparties these agreement provide the firm with the right in the event of default by the counterparty to net counterparty right and obligation under the agreement and to liquidate and set off cash collateral against any net amount owed by the counterparty derivative with enforceable master netting agreement are reported net of cash collateral received and posted however in certain circumstance the firm may not have such an agreement in place the relevant insolvency regime may not support the enforceability of the master netting agreement or collateral agreement or the firm may not have sought legal advice to support the enforceability of the agreement in case where the firm ha not determined an agreement to be enforceable the related amount are not offset see note the firm policy is generally to receive cash and or security posted collateral with right of rehypothecation irrespective of the enforceability determination regarding the master netting and collateral agreement in certain case the firm may agree for such collateral to be posted to third party custodian under control agreement that enables it to take control of such collateral in the event of counterparty default the enforceability of the master netting agreement is taken into account in the firm risk management practice and application of counterparty credit limit for information related to offsetting of derivative see note hedge accountingthe firm applies hedge accounting using various derivative financial instrument for the following type of hedge hedge of change in the fair value of asset and liability due to the risk being hedged fair value hedge hedge of variability in forecasted cash flow from floating rate asset due to contractually specified interest rate cash flow hedge and hedge of net investment in foreign operation whose functional currency is different from the reporting currency of the parent company net investment hedge these financial instrument are included within trading asset derivative and other contract or trading liability derivative and other contract in the balance sheet for hedge where hedge accounting is being applied the firm performs effectiveness testing and other procedure the change in the fair value of the designated portion of the hedging instrument should be highly correlated between and percent of the change in the fair value cash flow or carrying value due to translation gain or loss of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged the firm considers the impact of valuation adjustment related to counterparty credit spread and it own credit spread to determine whether they would cause the hedging relationship to be ineffective fair value hedge interest rate riskthe firm designated fair value hedge consist of interest rate swap designated hedge of change in the benchmark interest rate of certain fixed rate afs security and senior borrowing the firm also designates interest rate swap fair

regression analysis to perform an ongoing prospective and retrospective assessment of the effectiveness of these hedging relationship for qualifying fair value hedge of benchmark interest rate the change in the fair value of the derivative offset by the change in the fair value attributable to the change in the benchmark interest rate risk of the hedged asset liability is recognized in earnings each period component of interest income expense for afs security the change in fair value of the hedged item due to change other than the risk being hedged will continue to be reported in oci when

relating to it net investment in foreign operation to the extent that the notional amount of the hedging instrument equal the portion of the investment being hedged and the underlying exchange rate of the derivative hedging instrument is the same the exchange rate between the functional currency of the investee and the intermediate parent entity functional currency it is considered to be perfectly effective with no income statement recognition the gain or loss from revaluing hedge of net investment in foreign operation at the spot rate is reported within aoci the forward point on the hedging instrument are excluded from hedge effectiveness testing and change in the fair value of this excluded component are recorded currently in interest income cash flow hedge interest rate riskthe firm designated cash flow hedge consist of interest rate derivative designated hedge of variability in forecasted cash flow from floating rate asset due to change in the contractually specified interest

characteristic exist for multiple instrument considering all available information relevant to assessing the collectability of cash flow generally the firm applies probability of default loss given default model for instrument that are collectively assessed under which the acl is calculated the product of probability of default loss given default and exposure at default these parameter are forecast for each collective group of asset using scenario based statistical model if the instrument doe not share similar risk characteristic with other instrument including when it is probable that the firm will be unable to collect the full payment of principal and interest on the instrument when due the acl is measured on an individual basis the firm generally applies discounted cash flow method for instrument that are individually assessed the firm may also elect to use an approach that considers the fair value of the collateral when measuring the acl if the loan is collateral dependent repayment of the loan is expected to be provided substantially by the sale or operation of the underlying collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty additionally the firm can elect to use an approach to measure the acl that considers the fair value of collateral where the borrower is required to and reasonably expected to continually adjust and replenish the amount of collateral securing the instrument to reflect change in the fair value of such collateral the firm ha elected to use this approach for certain security based loan margin loan security purchased under agreement to resell and security borrowed credit quality indicator considered in developing the acl include corporate loan secured lending facility commercial real estate loan and
