ha agreed on replacement for mr buffett replacement be needed currently the board continually monitor this risk and could alter it current view regarding replacement for mr buffett in the future we believe that the board succession plan together with the outstanding manager running our numerous and highly diversified operating unit help to mitigate this risk in berkshire board of director appointed mr gregory abel vice chairman of berkshire non insurance operation and mr ajit jain vice chairman of berkshire insurance operation mr abel and mr jain each report directly to mr buffett and

business model we need qualified and competent management to direct day to day business activity of our operating subsidiary and to manage change in future business operation due to changing business or regulatory environment our operating subsidiary also need qualified and competent personnel in executing their business plan and serving their customer supplier and other stakeholder our inability to recruit and retain qualified and competent manager and personnel could negatively affect the operating result financial condition and liquidity of our subsidiary and berkshire whole investment are unusually concentrated and fair value are subject to loss in value we concentrate high percentage of the investment of our insurance subsidiary in relatively small number of equity security and diversify our investment portfolio far le than is conventional in the insurance industry significant decline in the fair value of our larger investment in equity security may produce material decline in our consolidated shareholder equity and our consolidated statement of earnings since large percentage of our equity security are held by our insurance subsidiary significant decrease in the fair value of these investment will produce significant decline in their statutory surplus our large statutory surplus is competitive advantage and long term material decline could have an adverse effect on our claim paying ability rating and our ability to write new insurance business thus potentially reducing our future underwriting profit competition and technology may erode our business franchise and result in lower earnings each of our operating business face intense competition within market in which they operate while we manage our business with the objective of achieving long term sustainable growth by developing and strengthening competitive advantage many factor including technological change may erode or prevent the strengthening of competitive advantage accordingly our future operating result will depend to some degree on our operating unit successfully protecting and enhancing their competitive advantage if our operating business are unsuccessful in these effort our periodic operating result in the future may decline deterioration of general economic condition may significantly reduce our operating earnings and impair our ability to access capital market at reasonable cost our operating business are subject to normal economic cycle which affect the general economy or the specific industry in which they operate significant deterioration of economic condition over prolonged period could produce material adverse effect on one or more of our significant operation in addition our utility and energy business and our railroad business regularly utilize debt component of their capital structure and depend on having access to borrowed fund through the capital market at reasonable rate to the extent that access to the capital market is restricted or the cost of funding increase these operation could be adversely affected terrorist act could hurt our operating business successful defined by the aggressor cyber biological nuclear or chemical attack could produce significant loss to our worldwide operation our business operation could be adversely affected from such act through the loss of human resource or destruction of production facility and information system we share the risk with all business regulatory change may adversely impact our future operating result over time in response to financial market crisis global economic recession and social and environmental issue regulatory initiative were adopted in the united state and elsewhere such initiative addressed for example the regulation of bank and other major financial institution and environmental and global warming matter these initiative impact all of our business albeit in varying way increased regulatory compliance cost could have significant negative impact on our operating business well on the business in which we have significant but not controlling economic interest we can not predict whether such initiative will have material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position result of operation or cash flow data privacy regulation have recently been enacted in various jurisdiction in the and throughout the world these regulation address numerous aspect related to the security of personal information that is stored in our information system network and facility failure to comply with these regulation could result in reputational damage and significant penalty table of content cyber security risk we rely on technology in virtually all aspect of our business like those of many large business certain of our information system have been subject to computer virus malicious code unauthorized access phishing effort denial of service attack and other cyber attack and we expect to be subject to similar attack in the future such attack become more sophisticated and frequent significant disruption or failure of our technology system could result in service interruption safety failure security event regulatory compliance failure an inability to protect information and asset against unauthorized user and other operational difficulty attack perpetrated against our system could result in loss of asset and critical information and expose to remediation cost and reputational damage although we have taken step intended to mitigate these risk including business continuity planning disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis significant disruption or cyber intrusion could adversely affect our result of operation financial condition and liquidity additionally if we are unable to acquire develop implement adopt or protect right around new technology we may suffer competitive disadvantage which could also have an adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and liquidity cyber attack could further adversely affect our ability to operate facility information technology and business system or compromise confidential customer and employee information political economic social or financial market instability or damage to or interference with our operating asset customer or supplier from cyber attack may result in business interruption lost revenue higher commodity price disruption in fuel supply lower energy consumption unstable market increased security repair or other cost or may materially adversely affect in way that can not be predicted at this time any of these risk could materially affect our consolidated financial result furthermore instability in the financial market resulting from terrorism sustained or significant cyber attack or war could also have material adverse effect on our ability to raise capital we share these risk with all business derivative contract may require significant cash settlement payment and result in significant loss in the future over ten year ago we assumed the risk of potentially significant loss under number of equity index put option contract the contract remaining at year end will expire from through risk of loss under these contract are based on decline in equity price of stock comprising certain major and international stock index we received considerable cash premium compensation for accepting these risk absent major reduction in future equity security price our ultimate payment obligation are not likely to be significant nevertheless there can be no assurance that equity security price will not decline significantly resulting in settlement payment that significantly exceed the year end intrinsic value of the contract billion recorded fair value billion or the premium we received at inception billion risk unique to our regulated business our tolerance for risk in our insurance business may result in significant underwriting loss when properly paid for the risk assumed we have been and will continue to be willing to assume more risk from single event than any other insurer ha knowingly assumed accordingly we could incur significant loss from single event we may also write coverage for loss arising from act of terrorism we attempt to take into account all possible correlation and avoid writing group of policy from which pre tax loss from single event might aggregate above billion currently we estimate that our aggregate exposure from single event under outstanding policy is significantly below billion however despite our effort loss may aggregate in unanticipated way our tolerance for significant insurance loss may result in lower reported earnings in future period the degree of estimation error inherent in the process of estimating property and casualty insurance loss reserve may result in significant underwriting loss the principal cost associated with the property and casualty insurance business is claim in writing property and casualty insurance policy we receive premium today and promise to pay covered loss in the future however it will take decade before all claim that have occurred of any given balance sheet date will be reported and settled although we believe that liability for unpaid loss are adequate we will not know whether these liability or the premium charged for the coverage provided were sufficient until well after the balance sheet date estimating insurance claim cost is inherently imprecise our estimated unpaid loss arising under contract covering property and casualty insurance risk are large billion at december and small percentage increase to those liability can result in materially lower reported earnings change in regulation and regulatory action can adversely affect our operating result and our ability to allocate capital our insurance business are subject to regulation in the jurisdiction in which we operate such regulation may relate to among other thing the type of business that can be written the rate that can be charged for coverage the level of capital that must be maintained and restriction on the type and size of investment that can be made regulation may also

ptc mandate requiring all railroad that run on our track to be compliant before we can be deemed compliant the fra ha confirmed an extension of the deadline for the company to december complying with legislative and regulatory change may pose significant operating and implementation risk and require significant capital expenditure bnsf derives significant amount of revenue from the transportation of energy related commodity particularly coal to the extent that change in government policy limit or restrict the usage of coal source of fuel in generating electricity or alternate fuel such natural gas displace coal on competitive basis revenue and earnings could be adversely affected common carrier bnsf is also required to transport tih chemical and other hazardous material release of hazardous material could expose bnsf to significant claim loss penalty and environmental remediation obligation change in the regulation of the rail industry could negatively impact bnsf ability to determine price for rail service and to make capital improvement to it rail network resulting in an adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition or liquidity our utility and energy business operated under bhe are highly regulated by numerous federal state local and foreign governmental authority in the jurisdiction in which they operate these law and regulation are complex dynamic and

between the loss occurrence date and loss settlement date is the claim tail property claim usually have relatively short claim tail absent litigation casualty claim usually have longer claim tail

liability estimate include projection of ultimate claim count frequency and average loss per claim severity we utilize combination of several actuarial estimation method including bornhuetter ferguson and chain ladder methodology claim liability estimate for automobile liability coverage such bodily injury bi uninsured motorist and personal injury protection are more uncertain due to the longer claim tail so we establish additional case development estimate of december case development liability averaged approximately of the case reserve we select case development factor through analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case liability for incurred but not reported ibnr claim liability are based on projection of the ultimate number of claim expected reported and unreported for each significant coverage we use historical claim count data to develop age to age projection of the ultimate count by quarterly accident period from which we deduct reported claim to produce the number of unreported claim we estimate the average cost per unreported claim and apply such estimate to the unreported claim count producing an ibnr liability estimate we may record additional ibnr estimate when actuarial technique are difficult to apply we test the adequacy of the aggregate claim liability using one or more actuarial projection based on claim closure model and paid and incurred loss triangle each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claim occurring in given period and project the ultimate cost our claim liability estimate recorded at the end of decreased million during which produced corresponding increase to pre tax earnings we modified the assumption used to estimate liability at december to reflect the most recent frequency and severity result future development of recorded liability will depend on whether actual frequency and severity are more or le than anticipated with respect to liability for bi claim our most significant claim category we believe it is reasonably possible that average severity will change by at least one percentage point from the severity used in establishing the recorded liability at december we estimate that one percentage point increase or decrease in bi severity would produce million increase or decrease in recorded liability with corresponding decrease or increase in pre tax earnings many of the economic force that would likely cause bi severity to differ from expectation would likely also cause severity for other injury coverage to differ in the same direction table of content management discussion

contract issued through nico and general re in connection with reinsurance contract the nature extent timing and perceived reliability of premium and loss information received from ceding company varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting term contract term condition and coverage also tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly than primary insurance policy the nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative individual risk per occurrence excess or retroactive reinsurance contract may not differ significantly from the information received under primary insurance contract if reinsurer personnel either work closely with the ceding company in settling individual claim or manage the claim themselves however loss information is often le detailed with respect to aggregate excess of loss and quota share contract additionally loss information we receive through periodic report is often in summary format rather than on an individual claim basis loss data includes recoverable paid loss well case loss estimate ceding company infrequently provide reliable ibnr estimate to reinsurers loss reporting to reinsurers is typically slower in comparison to primary insurer periodic premium and claim report are required from ceding company in the such report are generally required at quarterly interval ranging from to day after the end of the quarterly period outside of the reinsurance reporting practice may vary further in certain country client report annually often to day after the end of the annual period in some instance reinsurers assume and cede underlying risk thereby creating multiple contractual party between and the primary insured potentially compounding the claim reporting delay the relative impact of reporting delay on the reinsurer may vary depending on the type of coverage contractual reporting term the magnitude of the claim relative to the attachment point of the reinsurance coverage and for other reason reinsurers the premium and loss data we receive is at least one level removed from the underlying claimant so there is risk that the loss data reported is incomplete inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage term when received we review the information for completeness and compliance with the contract term generally our reinsurance contract permit to access the ceding company book and record with respect to the subject business thus providing the ability to audit the reported information in the normal course of business dispute occasionally arise concerning whether claim are covered by our reinsurance policy we resolve most coverage dispute through negotiation with the client if dispute can not be resolved our contract generally provide arbitration or

paid and incurred loss development technique incurred and paid loss bornhuetter ferguson technique and frequency and severity technique are utilized well ground up technique when appropriate the critical process involved in estimating unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense include the establishment of case liability estimate the determination of expected loss ratio and loss reporting pattern which drive ibnr liability estimate and the comparison of reported activity to the expected loss reporting pattern general re process for estimating unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense start with case loss estimate reported by ceding company we independently evaluate certain reported case loss and if appropriate we use our own case liability estimate of december our case loss estimate exceeded ceding company estimate by approximately billion which were concentrated in legacy worker compensation claim occurring over year ago we also periodically conduct detailed review of individual client claim which may cause to adjust our case estimate in estimating ibnr liability general re considers expected case loss emergence and development pattern together with expected loss ratio by year in this process we classify all loss and premium data into group or portfolio of policy based primarily on product type treaty facultative and program line of business auto liability property and worker compensation and or geographic jurisdiction and in some case contractual feature or market segment for each portfolio we aggregate premium and loss by accident year or coverage period and analyze the paid and incurred loss data over time we estimate the expected development of reported claim which together with the expected loss ratio are used to calculate ibnr liability estimate factor affecting our loss development analysis include but are not limited to change in the following client claim reporting and settlement practice the frequency of client company claim review policy term and coverage such loss retention level and occurrence and aggregate policy limit loss trend and legal trend that result in unanticipated loss collectively these factor influence our selection of expected case loss emergence pattern nico generally establishes reinsurance claim liability on contract by contract basis determined from case loss estimate reported by ceding company and ibnr liability that are primarily function of an anticipated loss ratio for the contract and the reported case loss estimate liability are adjusted upward or downward over time to reflect case loss reported versus expected case loss which we use to form revised judgment on the adequacy of the expected loss ratio and the level of ibnr liability required for unreported claim anticipated loss ratio are also revised to include estimate of known major catastrophe event certain catastrophe individual risk and aviation excess of loss contract tend to generate low frequency high severity loss our process and

for such claim excluding amount assumed under retroactive reinsurance contract were approximately billion at december we may use industry wide loss experience data and informed judgment when internal loss data is of limited reliability in making estimate for such loss loss estimation for these exposure are difficult to determine due to the changing legal environment and increase may be required in the future if new exposure or claimant are identified new claim are reported or new theory of liability emerge in addition to the previously described methodology we consider survival ratio which is the average net claim payment in recent year in relation to net unpaid loss rough guide to reserve adequacy our survival ratio wa approximately year of december retroactive reinsurance our retroactive reinsurance contract cover loss event occurring before the contract inception date claim liability relating to our retroactive reinsurance contract are predominately related to casualty or liability exposure we expect the claim tail to be very long our gross unpaid loss deferred charge asset and net liability at december were follows in million gross unpaid loss deferred charge liability net ofdeferred charge december our contract are generally subject to maximum limit of indemnification we currently expect that maximum remaining gross loss payable under our retroactive policy will not exceed billion due to the applicable aggregate contract limit absent significant judicial or legislative change affecting asbestos environmental or latent injury exposure we also currently believe it unlikely that loss will develop upward to the maximum loss payable or downward by more than of our billion estimated liability at december we establish liability estimate by individual contract considering exposure and development trend in establishing our liability estimate we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment pattern and project expected ultimate loss under various scenario we assign judgmental probability factor to these scenario and an expected outcome is determined we then monitor subsequent loss payment activity and review ceding company report and other available information concerning the underlying loss we re estimate the expected ultimate loss when significant event or significant deviation from expected result are revealed certain of our retroactive reinsurance contract include asbestos environmental and other latent injury claim our estimated liability for such claim were approximately billion at december we do not consistently receive reliable detailed data regarding asbestos environmental and latent injury claim from all ceding company particularly with respect to multi line or aggregate excess of loss policy when possible we conduct detailed analysis of the underlying loss data to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured loss when detailed loss information is unavailable we develop estimate by applying recent industry trend and projection to aggregate client data judgment in these area necessarily consider the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which we expect these claim will be adjudicated legal reform and legislation could also have significant impact on our ultimate liability we reduced estimated ultimate liability for prior year retroactive reinsurance contract by million in which after the change in related deferred charge asset resulted in pre tax earnings of million in we paid loss and loss adjustment expense of approximately billion with respect to these contract in connection with our retroactive reinsurance contract we also record deferred charge asset which at contract inception represents the excess if any of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid loss over premium we amortize deferred charge asset which produce charge to pre tax earnings in future period based on the expected timing and amount of loss payment we also adjust deferred charge balance due to change in the expected timing and ultimate amount of claim payment significant change in such estimate may have significant effect on unamortized deferred charge balance and the amount of periodic amortization based on the contract in effect of december we currently estimate that amortization expense in will approximate billion table of content management discussion and analysis continued other critical accounting policy our consolidated balance sheet at december included goodwill of acquired business of billion we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of our review includes determining the estimated fair value of our reporting unit there are several method of estimating reporting unit fair value including market quotation underlying asset and liability fair value determination and other valuation technique such discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flow and multiple of earnings we primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow method the key assumption and input used in such method may include forecasting revenue and expense operating cash flow and capital expenditure well an appropriate discount rate and other input significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of reporting unit and in performing goodwill impairment test due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting cash flow and earnings actual result may vary significantly from the forecast if the carrying amount of reporting unit including goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value then required by gaap we estimate the fair value of the identifiable asset and liability of the reporting unit the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of it net asset establishes the implied value of goodwill the excess of the recorded amount of goodwill over the implied goodwill value is charged to earnings an impairment loss market risk disclosure our consolidated balance sheet include substantial amount of asset and liability whose fair value are subject to market risk our significant market risk are primarily associated with equity price interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price the fair value of our investment portfolio and equity index put option contract remain subject to considerable volatility the following section address the significant market risk associated with our business activity equity price risk equity security represent significant portion of our investment portfolio strategically we strive to invest in business that posse excellent economics and able and honest management and we prefer to invest meaningful amount in each investee consequently equity investment are concentrated in relatively few issuer at december approximately of the total fair value of equity security wa concentrated in five issuer we often hold our equity investment for long period and short term price volatility ha occurred in the past and will occur in the future we also strive to maintain significant level of shareholder capital and ample liquidity to provide margin of safety against short term price volatility we are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contract while our ultimate liability with respect to these contract is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between the contract inception date and expiration date fair value of these contract are also affected by change in other factor such interest rate expected dividend rate and the remaining duration of the contract the following table summarizes our equity security and derivative contract liability with significant equity price risk of december and and the estimated effect of hypothetical increase and decrease in market price of those date the selected hypothetical increase and decrease doe not reflect the best or worst case

we may also invest in bond loan or other interest rate sensitive instrument our strategy is to acquire or originate such instrument at price considered appropriate relative to the perceived credit risk we also issue debt in the ordinary course of business to fund business operation business acquisition and for other general purpose we attempt to maintain high credit rating in order to minimize the cost of our debt we infrequently utilize derivative product such interest rate swap to manage interest rate risk the fair value of our fixed maturity investment loan and finance receivables and note payable and other borrowing will fluctuate in response to change in market interest rate in addition change in interest rate assumption used in our equity index put option contract model cause change in reported liability with respect to those contract increase and decrease in interest rate generally translate into decrease and increase in fair value of these instrument additionally fair

amortized cost is recovered or do not expect to ultimately recover the amortized cost basis even if we do not intend to sell the security under scenario we recognize the loss in earnings and under

security we carry substantially all of our investment in equity security at fair value and record the subsequent change in fair value in the consolidated statement of earnings component of investment gain loss prior to january substantially all of our equity security investment were classified available for sale and were also carried at fair value however we recorded the periodic change in fair value of these security component of other comprehensive income and we recorded gain and loss in the consolidated statement of earnings when equity security were sold on specific identification basis or were other than temporarily impaired investment under the equity method we utilize the equity method to account for investment when we posse the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over the operating and financial policy of the investee the ability to exercise significant influence is presumed when the investor posse more than of the voting interest of the investee this presumption may be overcome based on specific fact and circumstance that demonstrate that the ability to exercise significant influence is restricted we apply the equity method to investment in common stock and to other investment when such other investment posse substantially identical subordinated interest to common stock in applying the equity method we record the investment at cost and subsequently increase or decrease the carrying amount of the investment by our proportionate share of the net earnings or loss and other comprehensive income of the investee we record dividend or other equity distribution reduction in the carrying value of the investment in the event that net loss of the investee reduce the carrying amount to zero additional net loss may be recorded if other investment in the investee are at risk even if we have not committed to provide financial support to the investee such additional equity method loss if any are based upon the change in our claim on

interstate natural gas pipeline asset to year and independent power plant and other asset to year we evaluate property plant and equipment for impairment when event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of such asset may not be recoverable or when the asset are held for sale upon the occurrence of triggering event we ass whether the estimated undiscounted cash flow expected from the use of the asset and the residual value from the ultimate disposal of the asset exceeds the carrying value if the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amount we reduce the carrying value to fair value and record an impairment loss in earnings except with respect to impairment of asset of our regulated utility and energy subsidiary where the impact of regulation are considered in evaluating the carrying value equipment held for lease we record addition to equipment held for lease at cost we depreciate equipment held for lease to estimated salvage value primarily using the straight line method over estimated useful life ranging from to year we also evaluate equipment held for lease for impairment consistent with policy for property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangible asset goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition price of business over the fair value of identified net asset of that business we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually when evaluating goodwill for impairment we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit there are several method that may be used to estimate reporting unit fair value including market quotation asset and liability fair value and other valuation technique including but not limited to discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flow and multiple of earnings if the carrying amount of reporting unit including goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value then the identifiable asset and liability of the reporting unit are estimated at fair value of the current testing date the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the current estimated fair value of net asset establishes the implied value of goodwill the excess of the recorded goodwill over the implied goodwill value is charged to earnings an impairment loss significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and performing goodwill impairment test we amortize intangible asset with finite life in pattern that reflects the expected consumption of related economic benefit or on straight line basis over the estimated economic life intangible asset with finite life are reviewed for impairment when event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable intangible asset with indefinite life are tested for impairment at least annually and when event or change in circumstance indicate that more likely than not the asset is impaired revenue recognition we earn insurance premium on prospective property casualty insurance and
