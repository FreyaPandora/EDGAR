reduction in the income from the property should such event occur our operation may be adversely affected if property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from such property is insufficient to pay that indebtedness the property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in loss of income and decline in our total asset value disruption in the credit market or downgrade in our credit rating may adversely affect our ability to access external financing for our growth and ongoing debt service requirement we depend on external financing principally debt financing to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturity of our outstanding debt our access to financing depends on our credit rating the willingness of bank to lend to and condition in the capital market we can not assure you that we will be able to obtain the financing we need for future growth or to meet our debt service obligation mature or that the

in which our net investment in the foreign operation is held we may pursue additional expansion and development opportunity outside the united state international development and ownership activity carry risk that are different from those we face with our domestic property and operation these risk include adverse effect of change in exchange rate for foreign currency change in foreign political and economic environment regionally nationally and locally challenge of complying with wide variety of foreign law including corporate governance operation tax and litigation differing lending practice difference in culture change in applicable law and regulation in the united state that affect foreign operation difficulty in managing international operation and obstacle to the repatriation

estimable the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may also adversely affect our ability to sell lease or redevelop property or to borrow using property collateral our effort to identify environmental liability may not be successful although we believe that our portfolio is in substantial compliance with federal state and local environmental law ordinance and regulation regarding hazardous or toxic substance this belief is based on limited testing nearly all of our property have been subjected to phase or similar environmental audit these environmental audit have not revealed are we aware of any environmental liability that we believe will have material adverse effect on our result of operation or financial condition however we can not assure you

renew lease and relet space at existing property we may not be able to lease new property to an appropriate mix of tenant or for rent that are consistent with our projection also when lease for our existing property expire the premise may not be relet or the term of reletting including the cost of allowance and concession to tenant may be le favorable than the current lease term to the extent that our leasing plan are not achieved our cash generated debt repayment and capital expenditure could be adversely affected change in economic and operating condition that occur subsequent to our review of recoverability of investment property and other asset could impact the assumption used in that assessment and could result in future charge to earnings if assumption regarding those investment differ from actual result some of our property depend on anchor store or major tenant to attract shopper and could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more of these anchor store or

maintain their store meet their obligation both to and to their external lender and supplier withstand takeover attempt by investor or rival or avoid bankruptcy and or liquidation may be impaired and result in closure of their store other tenant may be entitled to modify the economic or other term of their existing lease in the event of such closure the modification could be unfavorable to the lessor and could decrease rent or expense recovery charge additionally department store or major tenant closure may result in decreased customer traffic which could lead to decreased sale at our property if the sale of store operating in our property were to decline significantly due to the closing of anchor store or other national retailer adverse economic condition or other reason tenant may be unable to pay their minimum rent or expense recovery charge in the event of any default by tenant we may not be able to fully recover and or may experience delay and cost in enforcing our right landlord to recover amount due to under the term of our agreement with such party we face potential adverse effect from tenant bankruptcy bankruptcy filing by retailer occur regularly in the course of our operation we continually seek to lease vacant space resulting from tenant termination the bankruptcy of tenant particularly an anchor tenant may make it more difficult to lease the remainder of the affected property future tenant bankruptcy could adversely affect our property or impact our ability to successfully execute our re leasing strategy we face wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably our property compete with other retail property and other form of retailing such catalog and commerce website competition may come from mall outlet center community lifestyle center and other shopping center both existing well future development project well catalog and commerce the presence of competitive alternative affect our ability to lease space
