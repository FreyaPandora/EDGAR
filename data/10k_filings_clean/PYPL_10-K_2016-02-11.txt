conditionsubstantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payment industry may harm our business the global payment industry is highly competitive we compete against business in varied industry many of which are larger than we are have dominant and secure position in other industry or offer other good and service to consumer and merchant which we do not offer online and offline commerce are increasingly converging the pace of change innovation and disruption is also increasing the global payment industry is rapidly changing highly innovative and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny which may negatively affect the competitive landscape we compete against wide range of business with varying role in all form of payment including paper based transaction principally cash and check provider of traditional payment method particularly credit and debit card and automated clearing house transaction in particular well established bank payment network which facilitate payment for credit card user provider of digital wallet which offer customer the ability to pay online and or on mobile device through variety of payment method including with mobile

association providing proprietary payment network to facilitate payment within their own retail network such wal mart money remitters such moneygram western union global payment inc and euronet and provider of card reader for mobile device and of other point of sale and multi channel technology we often partner with many of these business we also face competition and potential competition from service that provide online merchant the ability to offer their customer the option of paying for purchase from their bank account or paying on credit in the united state and abroad issuer of stored value targeted at online payment other international online payment service provider other provider of online account based payment payment service targeting user of social network and online gaming

send and receive payment through their bank account online shopping service that provide special offer linked to specific payment provider and service that help merchant accept and manage virtual currency of content some of these payment provider have greater customer base volume scale resource and market share than we do which may provide significant competitive advantage some of our competitor may also be subject to le burdensome licensing anti money laundering counter terrorist financing and other regulatory requirement they may devote greater resource to the development promotion and sale of product and service and they may offer lower price or more effectively introduce their own innovative program and service that adversely impact our growth we also expect new entrant well established bank and other financial institution that do not currently offer online payment to offer competitive product and service in the future in addition some merchant provide such service for competing service tied to established bank and other financial institution may engender greater consumer confidence in the safety and efficacy of their service in certain country such germany netherlands and australia electronic fund transfer is leading method of payment for both online and offline transaction with which our product compete we compete primarily on the basis of the following ability to attract retain and engage both merchant and consumer ability to show that merchant will achieve incremental sale by offering our paypal service security of transaction and the ability for consumer to use our paypal product and service without sharing their financial information with the merchant or the party they are paying simplicity of our fee structure ability to develop service across multiple commerce channel including mobile payment and payment at the retail point of sale trust in our dispute resolution and buyer and seller protection program customer service brand recognition website mobile platform and application onboarding ease of use and accessibility system reliability and data security ease and quality of integration into third party mobile application and operating system and quality of developer tool such our application programming interface and software development kit if we are not able to differentiate our business from those of our competitor drive value for our customer or effectively align our resource with our goal and objective we may not be able to compete effectively against our competitor our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threat could materially and adversely harm our business our operating and financial result come primarily from transaction involving payment made in reporting period and are therefore subject to fluctuation that could adversely affect our business financial condition result of operation and cash flow well the trading price of our common stock our operating and financial result have varied on quarterly basis during our operating history and may continue to fluctuate significantly result of variety of factor including result of the risk set forth in this risk factor section it is difficult for to forecast the level or source of our revenue or earnings loss accurately in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business period to period comparison of our operating result may not be meaningful and you should not rely upon them an indication of future performance we do not have backlog and substantially all of our net revenue each quarter come primarily from transaction involving payment during that quarter due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenue it is also difficult to forecast expense percentage of net revenue quarterly and annual expense percentage of net revenue reflected in our financial statement may be significantly different from historical or projected rate our operating result in one or more future quarter may fall below the expectation of security analyst and investor the trading price of our common stock could decline perhaps substantially result of the factor described in this paragraph global and regional economic condition could harm our business our operation and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic condition adverse economic condition and event have negatively impacted regional and global financial market in the past and will likely continue to do so from time to time in the future these event and condition could have negative and adverse impact on the company and customer with which we do business in addition financial turmoil affecting the banking system or financial market could cause additional consolidation of the financial service industry significant financial service institution failure new or incremental tightening in the credit market low liquidity and extreme volatility or distress in the fixed income credit currency and equity market adverse impact to the company and customer with which we do business the banking system or financial market could have material adverse effect on our business including reduction in the volume and price of transaction on our payment platform of contentsif we can not keep pace with rapid technological development particularly development with respect to mobile payment to provide new and innovative program product and service the use of our product and our revenue could decline rapid significant and disruptive technological change continue to impact the industry in which we operate including development in payment card tokenization ecommerce social commerce mobile virtual currency and near field communication and other proximity payment device such contactless payment we can not predict the effect of technological change on our business in addition to our own initiative and innovation we rely in part on third party including some of our competitor for the development of and access to new technology we expect that new service and technology applicable to the industry in which we operate will continue to emerge which may be superior to or render obsolete the technology we currently use in our product and service developing and incorporating new technology into our product and service may require substantial expenditure take considerable time and ultimately may not be successful in addition our ability to adopt new service and develop new technology may be inhibited by industry wide standard payment network new law and regulation resistance to change from consumer or merchant or third party intellectual property right our success will depend on our ability to develop and incorporate new technology and adapt to technological change and evolving industry standard if we are unable to do so in timely or cost effective manner our business could be harmed for example mobile device are increasingly used for ecommerce transaction and payment and significant and growing portion of our customer access our payment platform through mobile device we may lose customer if we are not able to continue to meet our customer mobile and multi screen experience expectation the variety of technical and other configuration across different mobile device and platform increase the challenge associated with this environment in addition number of other company with significant resource and number of innovative startup have introduced product and service focusing on mobile market our ability to successfully address the challenge posed by the rapidly evolving market for mobile transaction is crucial to our continued success and any failure to continue to increase the volume of mobile transaction effected through our payment platform could harm our business change in how consumer fund their paypal transaction could harm our business we pay significant transaction fee when consumer fund payment transaction using credit card lower fee when consumer fund payment with debit card nominal fee when consumer fund payment transaction by electronic transfer of fund from bank account and nominal fee when consumer fund payment transaction from an existing paypal account balance or through our paypal credit product our financial success is highly sensitive to change in the rate at which our consumer fund payment using credit and debit card collectively payment card which can significantly increase our cost some of our consumer may prefer to use payment card especially if these payment card offer functionality and benefit not associated with the use of their bank account some of our offering including the ability of consumer to make limited number of guest payment without opening paypal account have higher rate of payment card funding than our basic product offering an increase in the portion of our payment volume funded using payment card or in fee associated with our funding mix or other event or development that make it more difficult or costly for to fund transaction by electronic transfer of fund from bank account or existing paypal account balance could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business some of our plan to lower our funding cost including our paypal credit product and enabling consumer to defer payment for short period of time on some transaction may increase the risk to of nonpayment by consumer our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breach our business involves the collection storage processing and transmission of customer personal data including financial information in addition significant number of our customer authorize to bill their payment card or bank account directly for all transaction and other fee charged by we have built our reputation on the premise that our payment platform offer customer secure way to make payment an increasing number of organization including large on line and line merchant and business other large internet company financial institution and government institution have disclosed breach of their information security system some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attack including on portion of their website or infrastructure for example in may ebay inc publicly announced that criminal were able to penetrate and steal certain data including user name encrypted user password and other non financial user data from certain of ebay marketplace business unit database which led to ebay marketplace requiring password reset and fewer ebay marketplace transaction using our paypal service the technique used to obtain unauthorized improper or illegal access to our system our data or customer data disable or degrade service or sabotage system are constantly evolving may be difficult to detect quickly and often are not recognized launched against target unauthorized party may attempt to gain access to our system or facility through various mean including among others hacking into the system or facility of or our partner or customer or attempting to fraudulently of contentsinduce our employee partner customer or others into disclosing user name password payment card information or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access our information technology system certain effort may be state sponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resource making them even more difficult to detect result of our prominence we believe that we are particularly attractive target for such breach and attack although we have developed system and process that are designed to protect our data and customer data and to prevent data loss and other security breach and expect to expend significant additional resource to bolster these protection these security measure can not provide absolute security our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security breach and third party may be able to access our customer personal or proprietary information and payment card data that are stored on or accessible through those system our security measure may also be breached due to employee error malfeasance system error or vulnerability or other irregularity any actual or perceived breach of our security could interrupt our operation result in our system or service being unavailable result in improper disclosure of data materially harm our reputation and brand result in significant legal and financial exposure lead to loss of customer confidence in or decreased use of our product and service and adversely affect our business and result of operation any breach of network or data security at our partner or customer could have similar effect in addition our customer could have vulnerability on their own computer system that are entirely unrelated to our system but could mistakenly attribute their own vulnerability to paypal in addition under payment card rule and our contract with our card processor if there is breach of payment card information that we store or that is stored by our direct payment card processing customer we could be liable to the payment card issuing bank for their cost of issuing new card and related expense we also expect to expend significant additional resource to protect against security or privacy breach and may be required to redress problem caused by breach among other reason financial service regulator in various jurisdiction including the united state and the european union have implemented or are considering proposal to impose new authentication requirement on bank and payment processor intended to reduce online fraud which could impose significant cost require to change our business practice make it more difficult for new customer to join paypal and reduce the ease of use of our product which could harm our business additionally our insurance policy carry low coverage limit which may not be adequate to reimburse for loss caused by security breach and we may not be able to collect fully if at all under these insurance policy system failure and resulting interruption in the availability of our website application product or service could harm our business our system may experience service interruption or degradation because of hardware and software defect or malfunction computer denial of service and other cyberattacks human error earthquake hurricane flood fire natural disaster power loss disruption in telecommunication service fraud military or political conflict terrorist attack computer virus or other malware or other event our system also may be subject to break in sabotage and intentional act of vandalism some of our system are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventuality in addition provider of payment solution we are subject to increased scrutiny by regulator that may require specific business continuity resiliency and disaster recovery plan and more rigorous testing of such plan this increased scrutiny may be costly and time consuming and may divert our resource from other business priority we have experienced and will likely continue to experience system failure denial of service attack and other event or condition from time to time that interrupt the availability or reduce or affect the speed or functionality of our product and service these event have resulted and likely will result in loss of revenue prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability speed or other functionality of our product and service could materially harm our business frequent or persistent interruption in our service could cause current or potential customer to believe that our system are unreliable leading them to switch to our competitor or to avoid our product and service and could permanently harm our reputation and brand moreover to the extent that any system failure or similar event result in damage to our customer or their business these customer could seek significant compensation or contractual penalty from for their loss and those claim even if unsuccessful would likely be time consuming and costly for to address and could have other consequence described in this risk factor section under the caption our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breach our payment platform ha suffered significant intermittent unavailability reliability is particularly critical for because the full time availability of our paypal product and service is critical to our goal of gaining widespread acceptance among consumer and merchant for digital and mobile payment we have undertaken certain system upgrade and platforming effort designed to improve our reliability and speed these effort are costly and time consuming involve significant technical risk and may divert our resource from new feature and product and there can be no guarantee that these effort will succeed because we are regulated financial institution in certain jurisdiction frequent or persistent site interruption could lead to regulatory scrutiny significant fine and penalty and mandatory and costly change to our business practice and ultimately could cause to lose of contentsexisting license that we need to operate or prevent or delay from obtaining additional license that we need to expand our business we also rely on facility component and service supplied by third party including ebay and our business may be materially adversely affected to the extent these component or service do not meet our expectation or these third party cease to provide the service or facility we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate for all loss that may result from interruption in our service result of system failure and similar event change to payment card network or bank fee rule or practice could harm our business we do not directly access the payment card network such visa and mastercard that enable our acceptance of credit card and debit card including some type of prepaid card accordingly we must rely on bank or other payment processor to process transaction and must pay fee for the service from time to time payment card network have increased and may increase in the future the interchange fee and assessment that they charge for each transaction which access their network our payment card processor may have the right to pas any increase in interchange fee and assessment on to well increase their own fee for processing any change in interchange fee and assessment could increase our operating cost and reduce our operating income in addition in some jurisdiction government have required visa and mastercard to reduce interchange fee or have opened investigation to whether visa or mastercard interchange fee and practice violate antitrust law in the united state the federal reserve board issued final rule capping debit card interchange fee at significantly lower rate than visa or mastercard previously charged in the european union the multilateral interchange fee mif regulation limit credit and debit interchange fee for payment and imposes business rule on card processing service any material reduction in credit or debit card interchange rate in the united state or other market could adversely affect our competitive position against traditional credit and debit card service provider and may subject to pricing pressure although it would also lower our cost future change to those regulation could potentially adversely affect our business we are required by our processor to comply with payment card network operating rule including special operating rule for payment service provider to merchant and we have agreed to reimburse our processor for any fine they are assessed by payment card network result of any rule violation by or our merchant the payment card network set and interpret the card operating rule from time to time the network have alleged that various aspect of our business model violate these operating rule if such allegation are not resolved they may result in material fine and penalty or require change in our business practice that may be costly the payment card network could adopt new operating rule or interpret or re interpret existing rule that we or our processor might find difficult or even impossible to follow or costly to implement result we could lose our ability to give consumer the option of using payment card to fund their payment or the choice of currency in which they would like their payment card to be charged if we are unable to accept payment card or are meaningfully limited in our ability to do so our business would be adversely affected we and our payment card processor have implemented specific business process for merchant to comply with payment card network operating rule for providing service to merchant any failure to comply with these rule could result in fine we are also subject to fine from payment card network if we fail to detect that merchant are engaging in activity that are illegal or that are considered high risk primarily the sale of certain type of digital content for high risk merchant we must either prevent such merchant from using our paypal service or register such merchant with the payment card network and conduct additional monitoring with respect to such merchant although the amount of these fine ha not been material to date additional fine in the future could become material and could result in termination of our ability to accept payment card or require change in our process for registering new customer which would materially harm our business payment card network rule may also increase the cost of impose restriction on or otherwise negatively impact the development of our retail point of sale solution which may negatively impact their deployment and adoption failure to deal effectively with fraud fictitious transaction bad transaction and negative customer experience would increase our loss rate and harm our business and could severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our service we incur substantial loss due to claim from consumer that merchant have not performed or that their good or service do not match the merchant description we seek to recover such loss from the merchant but may not be able to recover in full if the merchant is unwilling or unable to pay we also incur loss from claim that the consumer not authorize the purchase from consumer fraud from erroneous transmission and from customer who have closed bank account or have insufficient fund in them to satisfy payment in addition if loss incurred by related to payment card transaction become excessive they could of contentspotentially result in our losing the right to accept payment card for payment which would harm our business our paypal credit product are similarly subject to the risk of fraudulent activity we have taken measure to detect and reduce the risk of fraud but these measure need to be continually improved and may not be effective against new and continually evolving form of fraud or in connection with new product offering if these measure do not succeed our business could be harmed we are exposed to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate we have significant operation internationally that are denominated in foreign currency primarily the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar subjecting to foreign currency risk the strengthening or weakening of the dollar versus the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar impact the translation of our net revenue generated in these foreign currency into the dollar additionally in connection with providing our service in multiple currency we set our foreign exchange rate twice per day we may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign exchange rate or result of fluctuation in foreign exchange rate between the time that we set them given that we also hold some corporate and customer fund in non currency our financial result are affected by the translation of these non currency into dollar we also have foreign exchange risk on our asset and liability denominated in currency other than the functional currency of our subsidiary while we regularly enter into transaction to hedge portion of our foreign currency translation and balance sheet exposure it is impossible to predict or eliminate the effect of this exposure fluctuation in foreign exchange rate could significantly impact our financial result any factor that reduce cross border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business cross border trade transaction where the merchant or consumer were in different country is an important source of our revenue and profit cross border transaction generally provide higher revenue and operating income than similar transaction that take place within single country or market cross border trade also represents our primary and in some case our only presence in certain important market cross border trade is subject to and may be impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuation in addition the potential interpretation and application of law of multiple jurisdiction the jurisdiction of the merchant and of the consumer are often extremely complicated in the context of cross border trade the interpretation and or application of such law could impose additional requirement which may impose conflicting obligation and restriction on cross border trade any factor that increase the cost of cross border trade or restrict delay or make cross border trade more difficult or impractical would lower our revenue and profit and could harm our business our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight well extensive complex overlapping and frequently changing rule

and increasing in number and may impose overlapping and or conflicting requirement or obligation financial and political event have increased the level of regulatory scrutiny on the payment industry and regulatory agency may view matter or interpret law and regulation differently than they have in the past and in manner adverse to our business our success and increased visibility may result in increased regulatory oversight and tighter enforcement of rule and regulation that may apply to our business we expand and localize our international activity we are increasingly becoming obligated to comply with the law of the country or market in which we operate in addition because our service are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sale of good and provide service to customer worldwide one or more jurisdiction may claim that we or our customer are required to comply with their law law regulating the internet mobile and related technology outside of the united state often impose different more specific or even conflicting obligation on well broader liability for example certain transaction that may be permissible in local jurisdiction may be prohibited by regulation of department of treasury office of foreign asset control ofac or anti money laundering or counter terrorist financing regulation of contentsany failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new law and regulation including change to or expansion of the interpretation of those law and regulation including those discussed in this risk factor may subject to significant fine penalty criminal and civil lawsuit forfeiture of significant asset and other enforcement action in one or more jurisdiction result in additional compliance and licensure requirement increase regulatory scrutiny of our business restrict our operation force to change our business practice make product or operational change or delay planned product launch or improvement the foregoing could individually or in the

and service le attractive result in the loss of customer limit our ability to grow the business adversely affect our result of operation and harm our reputation the complexity of federal and state regulatory and enforcement regime coupled with the global scope of our operation and the evolving global regulatory environment could result in single event giving rise to large number of overlapping investigation and legal and regulatory proceeding by multiple government authority in different jurisdiction we have implemented policy and procedure designed to help ensure compliance with applicable law and regulation but there can be no assurance that our employee contractor or agent will not violate such law and regulation payment regulationin the united state paypal inc ha obtained license to

protection law and could also seek to persuade the luxembourg regulator to order paypal europe to conduct it activity in the local country through branch office these or similar action by these regulator could increase the cost of or delay our plan for expanding our business in european union country in addition the country that are member of the european union may each have different and potentially inconsistent interpretation of regulation implementing the european union payment service directive which could make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage the european commission ha proposed revision to the payment service and anti money laundering directive which could make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage finally if the asset of paypal europe exceed certain threshold or if the european central bank ecb determines that paypal europe is significant supervised entity or that some activity of paypal europe is subject to oversight by the ecb paypal europe or certain of it activity could become directly regulated by the ecb in addition to the luxembourg regulator the commission de surveillance du secteur financier our

rule and directive which we refer to privacy law relating to the collection use retention security processing and transfer which we refer to process of personally identifiable information about our customer and employee sometimes called personal data in the country where we operate much of the personal information that we process especially financial information is regulated by multiple privacy law and in some case the privacy law of multiple jurisdiction in many case these law apply not only to third party transaction but also to transfer of information between or among our subsidiary and other party with which we have commercial relationship the european court of justice in the schrems case ha ruled that the safe harbor framework clause one compliance method by which company could transfer personal data regarding citizen of the european union to the united state could no longer be relied upon the potential impact of this ruling is subject to further determination and additional development including the potential development of new form of safe harbor framework or requirement to find alternative base for the compliant transfer of personal data from the to the paypal inc ha not relied on the safe harbor framework for the transfer of personal data to the united state rather when our company wa subsidiary of ebay inc we relied on binding corporate rule that permitted such transfer upon separation from ebay we have continued to operate under these same binding corporate rule pending the approval of our application for our own independent binding corporate rule while paypal inc ha not relied on the safe harbor framework some of our data processing subsidiary service provider customer or other business partner do in addition because paypal europe is headquartered in luxembourg and subject to regulation bank in that jurisdiction we have relied on the one stop shop concept under which luxembourg ha been our lead data protection regulator in the however recent european court of justice ruling weltimmo affecting company that do business in the potentially could make subject to the local data protection law or regulatory enforcement activity of the various member state in which we have established legal entity regulatory scrutiny of privacy data protection collection use and sharing of data is increasing on global basis there is uncertainty associated with the legal and regulatory environment around privacy and data protection law which continue to develop in way we can not predict privacy and data protection law may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and impose inconsistent or conflicting requirement complying with varying jurisdictional requirement could increase the cost and complexity of compliance or require to change our business practice in manner adverse to our business and violation of privacy and data protection related law can result in significant penalty and damage to our brand and business in addition compliance with inconsistent privacy law may restrict our ability to provide service to our customer determination that there have been violation of law of privacy or data

working capital product in the united state both of these chartered financial institution are industrial bank chartered by the state of utah in the event of termination or interruption in the ability of the chartered financial institution that currently issue the paypal credit consumer product in the united state to lend under the paypal credit consumer product our chartered financial institution that issue the paypal working capital product in the ha agreed to take ownership of and originate loan with respect to all consumer account nevertheless any termination or interruption of either bank ability to lend could result in the inability to originate any new paypal credit or paypal working capital loan in the event of either bank inability to lend we would either need to reach similar agreement with another chartered financial institution or obtain our own bank charter or license we may be unable to reach similar agreement with another partner on favorable term or at all and obtaining bank charter or lending license would be time consuming and costly process and would subject to additional law and regulatory requirement which could be burdensome and increase our cost in

obtain paypal working capital advance among other indicator the lender applies proprietary risk model to help predict the merchant ability to repay the working capital advance these risk model may not accurately predict the creditworthiness of consumer or merchant due to inaccurate assumption about the particular consumer or merchant or the economic environment or limited product history among other factor the accuracy of these risk model and the ability of the lender and our ability to manage credit risk related to our paypal credit and paypal working capital product may also be affected by legal or regulatory change bankruptcy law and minimum payment regulation competitor action change in consumer behavior change in the economic environment and other factor like other business with significant exposure to loss from consumer credit we face the risk that paypal credit consumer account holder will default on their payment obligation making the receivables uncollectible and creating the risk of potential charge offs the non payment rate among account holder may increase due to among other thing change to underwriting standard worsening economic condition such recession or greater austerity in various country and high unemployment of contentsrates account holder who miss payment often fail to repay their loan and account holder who file for protection under the bankruptcy law generally do not repay their loan we purchase receivables related to paypal credit and paypal working capital product if we are unable to fund our purchase of these receivables adequately or in cost

adversely impact our customer spending level and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amount owed to higher interest rate often lead to higher payment obligation by customer to and other lender under mortgage credit card and other consumer loan which may reduce our customer ability to remain current on their obligation to and therefore lead to increased delinquency charge offs and allowance for loan and interest receivable which could have an adverse effect on our net income in july we entered into revolving credit facility result we will be exposed to fluctuation in interest rate to the extent of our borrowing under the facility which bear interest at floating rate change to our buyer and seller protection program could increase our loss rate our buyer and seller protection program protect merchant and consumer from fraudulent transaction in we increased the scope of our buyer protection program to cover digital good and intangible good and service in addition consumer who pay

to individual buyer seller and transaction and may also be impacted by regional variation to these program modification to these program resulting from change in regulatory requirement or change that we decide to implement such expanding the scope of transaction covered by one or more of these program upon paypal becoming an independent publicly traded company on july through the distribution of percent of the outstanding capital stock of paypal to ebay stockholder which we refer to the distribution we extended our protection program in several country to cover certain customer purchase on ebay and our cost associated with these program have therefore increased increase in our loss rate including result of changing our buyer and seller protection program could harm our business our international operation are subject to increased risk which could harm our business our international operation especially in european union country in particular united kingdom and germany and china have generated approximately one half of our net revenue in recent year in addition to uncertainty about our ability to generate revenue from our foreign operation and expand into international market and the foreign currency risk discussed earlier in this risk factor section under the caption we are exposed to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate there are risk inherent in doing business internationally including expense associated with localizing our product and service and customer data including offering customer the ability to transact business in the local currency and adapting our product and service to local preference payment method with which we may have limited or no experience trade barrier and change in trade regulation difficulty in developing staffing and

our business our failure to manage the asset underlying our customer fund properly could harm our business our ability to manage and account accurately for the asset underlying our customer fund requires high level of internal control our business continues to grow and we expand our product offering we must continue to strengthen our associated internal control our success requires significant public confidence in our ability to handle large and growing transaction volume and amount of customer fund any failure to maintain the necessary control or to manage the asset underlying our customer fund accurately could result in reputational harm lead customer to discontinue or reduce their use of our product and result in significant penalty and fine which could harm our business we are subject to regulatory activity and antitrust litigation under competition law we are subject to scrutiny by various government agency under and foreign law and regulation including antitrust and competition law an increasing number of jurisdiction also provide private right of action for competitor or consumer to assert claim of anti competitive conduct other company and government agency have in the past and may in the future allege that our action violate the antitrust or competition law of the united state individual state other country or the european commission or otherwise constitute unfair competition an increasing number of government are regulating competition law activity including increased scrutiny in large market such china our business agreement or arrangement with customer or other company could give rise to regulatory action or antitrust litigation some regulator particularly those outside of the of contentsunited state may perceive our business to be used so broadly that otherwise uncontroversial business practice could be deemed anticompetitive any claim or investigation even if without foundation may be very expensive to defend or respond to involve negative publicity and substantial diversion of management time and effort and could result in significant judgment against or require to change our business practice we are subject to patent litigation we have repeatedly been sued for allegedly infringing other party patent at any given time we are typically defendant in number of patent lawsuit and have been notified of several other potential patent dispute we expect that we will increasingly be subject to patent infringement claim because among other reason our product and service continue to expand in scope and complexity we continue to expand into new business area including through acquisition and the number of patent owner who may claim that we any of the company that we have acquired or our customer infringe their patent and the aggregate number of patent controlled by such patent owner continues to increase such claim may be brought directly against and or against our customer whom we may indemnify either because we are contractually obligated to do so or we choose to do so business matter we believe that an increasing number of these claim against and other technology company have been and continue to be initiated by third party whose sole or primary business is to assert such claim in addition we have seen significant patent dispute between operating company in some technology industry patent claim whether meritorious or not are time consuming and costly to defend and resolve and could require to make expensive change in our method of doing business enter into costly royalty or licensing agreement make substantial payment to satisfy adverse judgment or settle claim or proceeding or cease conducting certain operation which would harm our business we may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property right or third party may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property right we believe the protection of our intellectual property including our trademark patent copyright domain name trade dress and trade secret is critical to our success we seek to protect our intellectual property right by relying on applicable law and regulation in the united state and internationally well variety of administrative procedure we also rely on contractual restriction to protect our proprietary right when offering or procuring product and service including confidentiality and invention assignment agreement entered into with our employee and contractor and confidentiality agreement with party with whom we conduct business effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our product and service are made available and contractual arrangement and other step that we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent third party from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property or deter independent development of equivalent or superior intellectual property right by others we must protect our intellectual property right including our trademark patent copyright domain name trade dress trade secret and other proprietary right in an increasing number of jurisdiction process that is expensive and time consuming we may not be successful in protecting or enforcing our right in every jurisdiction also we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary right we have licensed in the past and expect to license in the future certain of our proprietary right such trademark or copyrighted material to others these licensee may take action that diminish the value of our proprietary right or harm our reputation any failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property right or significant cost incurred in doing so could materially harm our business the number of product in the software industry increase and the functionality of these product further overlap and we acquire technology through acquisition or license we may become increasingly subject to intellectual property infringement and other claim litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the patent and other intellectual property right of others the ultimate outcome of any allegation is uncertain and regardless of the outcome any such claim with or without merit may be time consuming result in costly litigation divert management time and attention from our business and require to among other thing stop providing transaction processing and other payment related service or redesign stop selling our product or service pay substantial amount to satisfy judgment or settle claim or lawsuit pay substantial royalty or licensing fee or satisfy indemnification obligation that we have with certain party with whom we have commercial relationship our failure to obtain necessary license or other right or litigation or claim arising of intellectual property matter may harm our business of contentswe are regularly subject to general litigation regulatory dispute and government inquiry we are regularly subject to claim lawsuit including class action and individual lawsuit government and regulatory investigation and other proceeding involving competition and antitrust law intellectual property privacy data protection information security consumer protection accessibility claim security tax labor and employment commercial dispute service escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned property and other matter in particular our business face ongoing consumer protection and intellectual property litigation discussed above the number and significance of these dispute and inquiry have increased our company ha grown larger our business ha expanded in scope and geographic reach and our product and service have increased in complexity in addition the law rule and regulation affecting our business including those pertaining to internet and mobile commerce payment service and credit are subject to ongoing interpretation by the court and governmental authority and the resulting uncertainty in the scope and application of these law rule and regulation increase the risk that we will be subject to private claim and governmental action alleging violation of those law rule and regulation the scope outcome and impact of claim lawsuit government investigation and proceeding that we are subject to can not be predicted with certainty regardless of the outcome such investigation and proceeding can have an adverse impact on because of legal cost diversion of management resource and other factor determining reserve for our pending litigation is complex fact intensive process that is subject to management judgment resolving one or more such legal and regulatory proceeding could potentially require to make substantial payment to satisfy judgment fine or penalty or to settle claim or proceeding any of which could materially and adversely affect our business these proceeding could also result in reputational harm criminal sanction consent decree or order preventing from offering certain product or service requiring change in our business practice in costly way or development of non infringing or otherwise altered product or technology any of these consequence could materially and adversely affect our business certain of our customer agreement contain arbitration provision with class action waiver provision that may limit our exposure to consumer class action litigation but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing these arbitration provision or the class action waiver provision in them in the future or in any given case legislative administrative or regulatory development may directly or indirectly prohibit or limit the use of pre dispute arbitration clause and class action waiver provision any such prohibition or limitation on or discontinuation of the use of such arbitration or class action waiver provision could subject to additional lawsuit including additional consumer class action litigation or materially impact our ability to avoid exposure from consumer class action litigation we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liability the determination of our worldwide provision for income tax and other tax liability requires estimation and significant judgment and there are many transaction and calculation where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain like many other multinational corporation we are subject to tax in multiple and foreign tax jurisdiction our determination of our tax liability is always subject to audit and review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authority and we are currently undergoing number of investigation audit and review by taxing authority throughout the world including with respect to our tax structure any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have negative effect on our business and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amount recorded in our financial statement and may materially affect our financial result in the period for which such determination is made while we have established reserve based on assumption and estimate that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventuality these reserve may prove to be insufficient in addition our future income tax could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated or by the incurrence of loss in jurisdiction that have lower statutory tax rate and higher than anticipated in jurisdiction that have higher statutory tax rate by change in the valuation of our deferred tax asset and liability result of gain on our foreign exchange risk management program or change in tax law regulation or accounting principle well certain discrete item in light of continuing global fiscal challenge various level of government and international organization such the organization for economic co operation and development oecd and european union eu are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative or regulatory action to increase tax revenue these tax reform effort are designed to ensure that corporate entity are taxed on larger percentage of their earnings any such tax reform or other legislative or regulatory action to increase tax revenue could increase our effective tax rate we and our merchant may be subject to sale

hire of new employee diversion of management time and shift of focus from operating the business to the transaction and in the case of an acquisition integration and administration the need to integrate the operation system including accounting management information compliance human resource and other administrative system technology product and personnel of each acquired company which is an inherently risky and potentially lengthy and costly process the inefficiency and lack of control that may result if such integration is delayed or not implemented and unforeseen difficulty and expenditure that may arise result the need to implement or improve control procedure and policy appropriate for larger public company at company that prior to acquisition may have lacked such control procedure and policy or whose control procedure and policy did not meet applicable legal and other standard potential exposure to new or increased regulatory oversight associated with new line of

using the number of common share distributed on july for period prior to distribution in addition to the non gaap measure discussed above we also use free cash flow to ass our operating performance free cash flow represents cash flow from operating activity le purchase of property and equipment we consider free cash flow to be key performance measure that provides useful information to management and investor about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchase of property and equipment and including investment in our payment platform which can then be used to among other thing invest in our business make strategic acquisition and return cash to shareholder limitation of the utility of free cash flow measure of financial performance is that it doe not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period year ended december in million net cash provided by operating activity purchase of property and equipment free cash flow and capital resourceswe require liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operation including customer protection program our paypal credit product capital expenditure investment in our business

cash cash equivalent and available for sale investment of those date respectively during the first quarter of ebay changed it capital allocation strategy to reflect it objective of increasing it available cash preserving it credit rating and providing greater liquidity to meet it other cash need in the including potential merger and acquisition activity and funding opportunistic share repurchase on an accelerated basis result of the change in ebay capital allocation strategy we provided for income and applicable foreign withholding tax on billion of undistributed foreign earnings of certain of our non subsidiary for and prior year we recorded deferred tax liability of approximately million based on the estimated tax consequence of repatriating these earnings we did not provide for federal income and foreign withholding tax on billion of our non subsidiary undistributed earnings of december since we do not know the time or manner in which we may repatriate those fund we can not determine the impact of local tax withholding tax and foreign tax credit associated with the future repatriation of such earnings and therefore can not quantify the tax liability in the second quarter of we received contribution of approximately billion of cash from ebay well related estimated deferred tax liability of million associated with the foreign earnings that are not considered indefinitely reinvested in the fourth quarter of we reassessed the measurement of the deferred tax liability based on updated valuation information and reduced the deferred tax liability balance to million of december the adjustment to the deferred tax liability wa recorded contribution from ebay and resulted in an increase to net parent investment within stockholder equity this cash is being used for general corporate purpose in both our international and domestic operation in the third quarter of we entered into credit agreement credit agreement that provides for an unsecured billion five year revolving credit facility that includes million letter of credit sub facility and million swingline sub facility with available borrowing under the revolving credit facility reduced by the amount of any letter of credit and swingline borrowing outstanding from time to time borrowing and other amount payable under the credit agreement are guaranteed by paypal inc the guarantor we may also subject to the agreement of the applicable lender increase the commitment under the revolving credit facility by up to million subject to specified condition we may designate one or more of our subsidiary additional borrower under the credit agreement provided that we and the guarantor guarantee all borrowing and other obligation of any such subsidiary under the credit agreement of december no subsidiary were designated additional borrower fund borrowed under the credit agreement may be used for working capital capital expenditure acquisition and other general corporate purpose of december no borrowing or letter of credit were outstanding under the credit agreement accordingly at december billion of borrowing capacity wa available for the purpose permitted by the credit

agreement the credit agreement will terminate and all amount owing thereunder will be due and payable on july unless the commitment are terminated earlier either at our request or if an event of default occurs by the lender or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcy related event or the maturity date is extended upon our request subject to the agreement of the lender the credit agreement contains customary representation warranty affirmative and negative covenant including financial covenant event of default and indemnification provision in favor of the bank the negative covenant include restriction regarding the incurrence of lien subject to certain exception the financial covenant require to meet quarterly financial test with respect to minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and maximum consolidated leverage ratio based on our public debt rating we have cash pooling arrangement with financial institution for cash management purpose the arrangement allows for cash withdrawal from the financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balance held within the financial institution aggregate cash deposit the arrangement also allows to withdraw amount exceeding the aggregate cash deposit up to an agreed upon limit the net balance of the withdrawal and the aggregate cash deposit are used by the financial institution basis for calculating our net interest expense or income under these arrangement of december we had total of billion in cash withdrawal offsetting our billion in aggregate cash deposit held within the financial institution under the cash pooling arrangement of contentsas of december we were rated investment grade by standard and poor financial service llc and fitch rating inc we expect that these credit rating agency will continue to monitor our performance now that we have separated from ebay including our capital structure and result of operation our goal is to be rated investment grade but circumstance change there are factor that could drive the long term credit rating both down and up if that were to occur it could increase our borrowing cost including the interest rate on loan under our credit agreement the risk of loss from our customer protection program are specific to individual customer merchant and transaction and may also be impacted by regional variation in these program and modification to the program resulting from change to regulatory requirement for the period presented in these combined and consolidated financial statement included in this report payment under these customer protection program have ranged between and of tpv historical trend may not be an indication of future result in addition prior to the distribution we recovered certain amount from ebay related to customer protection program offered on eligible ebay purchase made with paypal these cost included the actual amount of protection loss associated with ebay customer protection program that we administered and funded on behalf of ebay which are included reduction of transaction and loan loss following the distribution we no longer administer ebay customer protection program or recover amount from ebay associated with transaction loss incurred on eligible ebay purchase instead we and ebay each independently administer our own customer protection program further our customer protection program extend to customer eligible purchase on ebay and therefore we have incurred and expect to continue to incur incremental cost associated with our customer protection program following the distribution we currently fund the purchase of the paypal credit consumer receivables with international and domestic cash resource to the extent that our paypal credit product become more widely available and we further promote paypal credit customer adoption and usage of such product may expand any resulting growth in the portfolio of loan receivables would increase our liquidity need and any failure to meet those liquidity need could adversely affect our business in the second quarter of we completed an arrangement with certain investor under which we sold participation interest in certain consumer loan and interest receivables related to our paypal credit product with gross book value of approximately million the sale resulted in cash proceeds of approximately million of which million related to the outstanding principal and million related to the interest receivable we will continue to evaluate partnership and third party source of funding of our credit portfolio including but not limited to commercial bank securitization market private equity firm and sovereign wealth fund and under certain specific circumstance the use of customer fund our objective is to expand the availability of our credit product with capital from external source although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving that goal we believe that our access to the capital market and fund that may be available from other third party source together with cash expected to be generated from operation will be sufficient to fund our paypal credit product for the foreseeable future in the second quarter of we agreed subject to certain condition that we one of our affiliate or designated third party would purchase portfolio of consumer loan receivables relating to the customer account arising out of our credit program agreement with synchrony financial formerly ge capital retail bank for price based on the book value of the consumer loan receivables portfolio at the time of the purchase expected to be october subject to certain adjustment and exclusion in the third quarter of we amended and extended the existing credit card program agreement on new term part of the amended agreement our obligation to purchase the portfolio of consumer loan receivables relating to the customer account arising out of the credit program agreement with synchrony financial wa terminated we retain an option to purchase the portfolio at the end of the new contract term in january our board of director authorized stock repurchase program that provides for the repurchase of up to billion of our common stock with no expiration from the date of authorization this stock repurchase program is intended to offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation program and subject to market condition and other factor may also be used to make opportunistic repurchase of our common stock to reduce outstanding share count any share repurchase under our stock repurchase program may be made through open market transaction block trade privately negotiated transaction or other mean at time and in such amount management deems appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternative however any stock repurchase are subject to market condition and other uncertainty and we can not predict if or when any stock repurchase will be made moreover we may terminate our stock repurchase program at any time without notice our liquidity access to capital and borrowing cost could be adversely impacted by decline in our credit rating our financial performance and global credit market condition well broad range of other factor in addition our liquidity access to capital and borrowing cost could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceeding to which we are party see risk factor risk factor that may affect our business result of operation and financial condition and note commitment and contingency to the combined and consolidated financial statement for additional discussion of these and other risk facing our business of contentswe believe that our existing cash cash equivalent available for sale investment cash expected to be generated from operation and our expected access to capital market together with potential external funding through

utilize under lease arrangement the amount presented are consistent with contractual term and are not expected to differ significantly from actual result under our existing lease unless substantial change in our headcount need requires to expand our occupied space or exit an office facility early we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of liability related to unrecognized tax benefit net the table doe not include million of such non current liability included in deferred and other tax liability recorded on our consolidated balance sheet of december seasonalitythe company doe not experience meaningful seasonality no individual quarter in or accounted for more than of net revenue critical accounting policy and estimatesthe application of gaap requires to make estimate and assumption about certain item and future event that directly affect our reported financial condition we have established detailed policy and control procedure to provide reasonable assurance that the method used to make estimate and assumption are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period the accounting estimate and assumption discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to our financial statement an accounting estimate is considered critical if both the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved and the impact within reasonable range of outcome of the estimate and assumption is material to our financial condition senior management ha discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimate with the audit committee of our board of director our significant accounting policy including recent accounting pronouncement are described in note overview and summary of significant accounting policy to the combined and consolidated annual financial statement quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where that information is reasonably available can be reliably estimated and provides material information to investor the amount used to ass sensitivity are included to allow user of this report to understand general direction cause and effect of change in the estimate and do not represent management prediction of variability for all of these estimate it should be noted that future event rarely develop exactly forecasted and estimate require regular review and adjustment transaction and loan lossestransaction and loan loss include the expense associated with our customer protection program fraud chargebacks and credit loss associated with our loan receivable balance we expect our transaction and loan loss to fluctuate depending on many factor including the total tpv macroeconomic condition the extent of our customer protection program the impact of regulatory change and the credit quality of loan receivable arising from transaction funded with our paypal credit product and working capital advance to selected merchant seller we establish allowance for estimated transaction loss arising from processing customer transaction such chargebacks for unauthorized credit card use and merchant related chargebacks due to non delivery of good or service ach return buyer protection program claim account take over and account overdraft addition to the allowance in the form of provision are reflected in transaction and loan loss in our combined and consolidated statement of income the allowance which involve the use of actuarial technique are monitored monthly and are updated based on actual claim data reported by our claim processor and other actual data received the allowance are based on known fact and circumstance internal factor including experience with similar case historical trend involving loss payment pattern and the mix of transaction and loss type we also establish an allowance for loan receivable which represents our estimate of probable incurred loan loss inherent in our consumer loan receivable and merchant working capital advance increase to the allowance for loan receivable are reflected transaction and loan loss in our combined and consolidated financial statement this evaluation process is subject to numerous estimate and judgment and is primarily based on forecasted principal balance delinquency rate roll rate roll rate represent the percentage of balance which we estimate will migrate from one stage of delinquency to the next based on our historical experience well external factor such estimated bankruptcy and level of unemployment roll rate are applied to principal balance for each stage of delinquency from current to day past due in order to estimate the principal loan which have incurred loss event and are probable to be charged off the determination of delinquency from current to day past due for principal balance related to merchant working capital advance is based on the current expected repayment period of the advance and fixed fee compared to the original expected repayment period we calculate the repayment rate based on the merchant expected future payment volume such that repayment of the advance and fixed fee is typically expected to occur within to month from the date of the advance on monthly basis we recalculate the repayment period based on the actual repayment activity on the receivable such actual repayment period are dependent on actual payment processing volume of contentsthe allowance for loss against the interest and fee receivable is primarily determined by applying historical average customer account roll rate to the interest receivable balance in each stage of delinquency to project the value of account that have incurred loss and are probable to be charged off we charge off loan receivable balance in the month in which the customer balance becomes day past due bankrupt account are charged off within day of receiving notification from the bankruptcy court past due loan receivable continue to accrue interest until such time they are charged off with the portion of the reserve related to interest receivable balance classified reduction of revenue determining appropriate allowance for these loss is an inherently uncertain process and ultimate loss may vary from the current estimate we regularly update our allowance estimate new fact become known and event occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of loss the allowance are maintained at level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for loss incurred at the balance sheet date based on our result for the year ended december an aggregate ten percentage increase in our transaction and loan loss rate would negatively impact transaction and loan loss by approximately million accounting for income taxesour annual tax rate is based on our income statutory tax rate and tax planning opportunity available to in the various jurisdiction in which we operate tax law are complex and subject to different interpretation by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authority significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax position including evaluating uncertainty we review our tax position quarterly and adjust the balance new information becomes available our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate that apply to our foreign earnings in addition to local country tax law and regulation our income tax rate depends on the extent that our earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the indefinite reinvestment is determined by management judgment about and intention concerning our future operation to the extent we do not intend to repatriate these earnings to fund operation we do not provide for federal income and foreign withholding tax on these earnings deferred tax asset represent amount available to reduce income tax payable on taxable income in future year such asset arise because of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax base of asset and liability well from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deduction and credit by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all source including reversal of taxable temporary difference forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategy these source of income rely heavily on estimate that are based on number of factor including our historical experience and short range and long range business forecast to the extent deferred tax asset are not expected to be realized we record valuation allowance we recognize and measure uncertain tax position in accordance with gaap pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merit of the position the tax benefit recognized in the financial statement from such position are then measured based on the largest benefit that ha greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we report liability for unrecognized tax benefit resulting from uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in tax return gaap further requires that change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax position be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs we recognize interest and penalty if any related to unrecognized tax benefit in income tax expense we file annual income tax return in multiple taxing jurisdiction around the world number of year may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authority and finally resolved while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position we believe that our reserve for income tax are adequate such that we reflect the benefit more likely than not to be sustained in an examination we adjust these reserve well the related interest where appropriate in light of changing fact and circumstance settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash based on our result for the year ended december one percentage point increase in our provision for income tax percentage of income before tax would have resulted in an increase in the provision of approximately million of contentsloss contingencieswe are currently involved in various claim legal proceeding and investigation of potential operating violation by regulatory oversight authority we regularly review the status of each significant matter and ass our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim legal proceeding or potential regulatory violation is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we accrue liability for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgment are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceeding the merit of our defense and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel because of uncertainty related to these matter accrual are based only on the best information available at the time additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claim litigation or other violation and may revise our estimate due to the inherent uncertainty of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdiction in which we operate our judgment may be materially different than the actual outcome revenue recognitionapplication of the various accounting principle in gaap related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires to make judgment and estimate complex arrangement with nonstandard term and condition may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting specifically the determination of whether we are principal to transaction gross revenue or an agent net revenue can require considerable judgment further we provide incentive payment to consumer and merchant which require judgment to determine whether the payment should be recorded reduction to gross revenue change in judgment with respect to these assumption and estimate could impact the amount of revenue recognized valuation of goodwill and intangiblesthe valuation of asset acquired in business combination and asset impairment review require the use of significant estimate and assumption the acquisition method of accounting for business combination requires to estimate the fair value of asset acquired liability assumed and any non controlling interest in the acquiree to properly allocate purchase price consideration between asset that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill impairment testing for asset other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset requires the allocation of cash flow to those asset or group of asset and if required an estimate of fair value for the asset or group of asset our estimate are based upon assumption believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable these valuation require the use of management assumption which would not reflect unanticipated event and circumstance that may occur we evaluate goodwill and intangible asset for impairment on an annual basis or sooner if indicator of impairment exist under the financial accounting standard board fasb guidance the evaluation of indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment allows for qualitative assessment to be performed which is similar to the fasb guidance for evaluating goodwill for impairment in performing these qualitative assessment we consider relevant event and condition including but not limited to macroeconomic trend industry and market condition overall financial performance cost factor company specific event legal and regulatory factor and our market capitalization previously assessed under ebay if the qualitative assessment indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset are le than their carrying amount we must perform quantitative impairment test under the quantitative impairment test if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill or indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill or indefinite lived intangible asset an impairment loss is recorded in the combined and consolidated statement of income measurement of the fair value of reporting unit is based on one or more of the following fair value measure amount at which the unit whole could be bought or sold in current transaction between willing party using present value technique of estimated future cash flow or using valuation technique based on multiple of earnings or

rate result we will be exposed to fluctuation in interest rate to the extent of our borrowing under the revolving credit facility of december no borrowing or letter of credit were outstanding under the credit agreement interest rate may also adversely impact our customer spending level and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amount owed to higher interest rate often lead to higher payment obligation by customer to and other lender under mortgage credit card and other consumer loan which may reduce our customer ability to remain current on their obligation to and therefore lead to increased delinquency charge offs and allowance for loan and interest receivable which could have an adverse effect on our net earnings basis point increase in interest rate would not have had
