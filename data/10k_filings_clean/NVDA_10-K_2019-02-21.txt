including customer service and customer support we also must meet customer safety and compliance standard which are subject to change additionally we continue to make considerable investment in research and development which may not produce significant revenue for several year if at all if our investment are unsuccessful and we fail to develop new product service and technology or if we focus on technology that do not become widely adopted our business revenue financial condition and result of operation could be adversely affected we can not assure you that our strategic direction will result in innovative product and technology that provide value to our customer partner and ultimately our shareholder if we fail to anticipate the changing need of our target market and emerging technology trend or if we do not appropriately adapt that strategy market condition evolve in timely manner to exploit potential market opportunity our business will be harmed competition in our current and target market could prevent from growing our revenue our target market remain extremely competitive and we expect competition to intensify current competitor expand their product and or service offering industry standard continue to evolve customer need change and new competitor enter these market our competitor product service and technology may be le costly or may offer superior functionality or better feature than ours which may result among other thing in lower than expected selling price for our product in addition some of our competitor operate and maintain their own fabrication facility have longer operating history larger customer base more comprehensive intellectual property or ip portfolio and patent protection and greater financial sale marketing and distribution resource than we do these competitor may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunity in new market and end user customer trend quickly transition their product including semiconductor product to increasingly smaller line width geometry and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging material which could harm our business if we are unable to successfully compete in our target market respond to change in our target market or introduce new offering to meet the need of this competitive environment including in significant international market such china demand for our product service and technology could decrease which would cause our revenue to decline and cause our result of operation to suffer in addition the competitive landscape in our target market ha changed and may continue to evolve due to trend toward consolidation which could lead to fewer customer partner or supplier any of which could negatively affect our financial result system security and data protection breach well cyber attack could disrupt our operation reduce our expected revenue and increase our expense which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation security breach computer malware and cyber attack have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent year these threat are constantly evolving making it increasingly difficult to successfully defend them or implement adequate preventative measure these attack have occurred on our system in the past and are expected to occur in the future experienced computer programmer hacker and employee may penetrate our security control and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of our employee or third party these attack may of contentscreate system disruption or cause shutdown these hacker may also develop and deploy virus worm and other malicious software program that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerability in our product including consumer and automotive product where we utilize over the air update to improve functionality over time for portion of our it infrastructure including business management and communication software product we rely on product and service provided by third party these provider may also experience breach and attack to their product which may impact our system data security breach may also result from non technical mean such action by an employee with access to our system to defend against security threat both to our internal system and those of our customer we must continuously engineer more secure product and enhance security and reliability feature which may result in increased expense actual or perceived breach of our security measure or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about our partner our customer or third party could expose and the party affected to risk of loss or misuse of this information resulting in litigation and potential liability paying damage regulatory inquiry or action damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business our effort to prevent and overcome these challenge could increase our expense and may not be successful we may experience interruption delay cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customer such disruption could adversely impact our ability to fulfill order and interrupt other critical function delayed sale lower margin or lost customer result of these disruption could adversely affect our financial result stock price and reputation if our product contain significant defect we could incur significant expense to remediate such defect our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market share our product are complex and may contain defect or security vulnerability or experience failure or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issue in design fabrication packaging material and or use within system these risk may increase our product are introduced into new device market technology and application including into the automotive market or new version are released some error in our product or service may only be discovered after product or service ha been shipped or used by customer or the end user of such product undiscovered vulnerability in our product or service could expose our customer or end user to hacker or other unscrupulous third party who develop and deploy virus worm and other malicious software program that could attack our product or service failure of our product to perform to specification or other product defect could lead to substantial damage to the product we sell directly to customer the end product in which our device ha been integrated by oems odms aibs and tier automotive supplier and to the user of such end product any such defect may cause to incur significant warranty support and repair or replacement cost write the value of related inventory cause to lose market share and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development effort to find and correct the issue in addition an error or defect in new product or release or related software driver after commencement of commercial shipment could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design win harm our relationship with customer and partner and harm consumer perception of our brand also we may be required to reimburse our customer partner or consumer including cost to repair or replace product in the field product recall including automotive recall or recall due to bug in our product or significant number of product return could be expensive damage our reputation harm our ability to attract new customer result in the shifting of business to our competitor and result in litigation against such product liability suit if product liability claim is brought against the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the effort of our technical and management personnel and harm our business further our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable term which could adversely impact our financial result we depend on third party and their technology to manufacture assemble test and or package our product which reduces our control over product quantity and quality manufacturing yield development enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business we do not manufacture the silicon wafer used for our gpus and tegra processor and do not own or operate wafer fabrication facility instead we are dependent on industry leading foundry such taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited and samsung electronics co ltd to manufacture our semiconductor wafer using their fabrication equipment and technique similarly we do not directly assemble test or package our product but instead rely on independent subcontractor we do not have long term commitment contract with these foundry or subcontractor result we face several significant risk which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand and or negatively impact our business operation gross margin revenue and or financial result including lack of guaranteed supply of wafer and other component and potential higher wafer and component price due to supply constraint failure by our foundry to procure raw material or to provide or allocate adequate or any manufacturing or test capacity for our product of content failure to develop obtain or successfully implement high quality leading edge process technology including transition to smaller geometry process technology such advanced process node technology and memory design needed to manufacture our product profitably or on timely basis loss of supplier and additional expense and or production delay result of qualifying new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of loss of or decision to add or change supplier lack of direct control over delivery schedule or product quantity and quality and delay in product shipment shortage decrease in product quality and or higher expense in the event our subcontractor or foundry prioritize our competitor order over our order or otherwise in addition low manufacturing yield could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand increase manufacturing cost harm customer or partner relationship and or negatively impact our business operation gross margin revenue and or financial result manufacturing yield for our product are function of product design which is developed largely by and process technology which typically is proprietary to the foundry low yield may result from either product design or process technology failure we do not know whether yield problem will exist our design is actually manufactured by the foundry result yield problem may not be identified until well into the manufacturing process and require and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem we also rely on third party software development tool to assist in the design simulation and verification of new product or product enhancement and to bring such new product and enhancement to market in timely manner in the past we have experienced delay in the introduction of product and enhancement result of the inability of then available software development tool to fully simulate the complex feature and functionality of our product the design requirement necessary to meet consumer demand for more feature and greater functionality from our product may exceed the capability of available software development tool if we miss design cycle or lose design win due to the unavailability of such software development tool we could lose market share and our revenue could decline if we fail to achieve design win for our product our business will be harmed for our product that we do not sell directly to consumer achieving design win is an important success factor achieving design win may involve lengthy process in pursuit of customer opportunity and depend on our ability to anticipate feature and functionality that customer and consumer will demand failure to obtain particular design win may prevent from obtaining design win in subsequent generation of particular product this could result in lost revenue and could weaken our position in future competitive bid selection process unanticipated change in industry standard could render our product incompatible with product developed by major hardware manufacturer and software developer further if our product are not in compliance with prevailing industry standard including safety standard our customer may not incorporate our product into their design strategy winning product design doe not guarantee sale to customer or that we will realize much revenue anticipated if any business disruption could harm our business lead to decline in revenue and increase our cost our worldwide operation could be disrupted by earthquake telecommunication failure power or water shortage outage at cloud service provider tsunami flood hurricane typhoon fire extreme weather condition cyber attack terrorist attack medical epidemic or pandemic and other natural or man made disaster catastrophic event or climate change the occurrence of any of these disruption could harm our business and result in significant loss decline in revenue and an increase in our cost and expense any of these business disruption could require substantial expenditure and recovery time in order to fully resume operation our corporate headquarters and portion of our research and development activity are located in california and other critical business operation finished good inventory and some of our supplier are located in asia near major earthquake fault known for seismic activity in addition large portion of our current datacenter capacity is located in california making our operation vulnerable to natural disaster or other business disruption occurring in these geographical area the manufacture of product component the final assembly of our product and other critical operation are concentrated in certain geographic location including taiwan china and korea geopolitical change or change in government regulation and policy in the united state or abroad also may result in changing regulatory requirement trade policy import duty and economic disruption that could impact our operating strategy product demand access to global market hiring and profitability in particular revision to law or regulation or their interpretation and enforcement could result in increased taxation trade sanction the imposition of import duty or tariff restriction and control on import or export or other retaliatory action which could have an adverse effect on our business plan for example regulation to implement the export control reform act of could have an adverse effect on our business plan catastrophic event can also have an impact on third party vendor who provide critical infrastructure service for it and research and development system and personnel our operation of contentscould be harmed if manufacturing logistics or other operation in these location are disrupted for any reason including natural disaster high heat event or water shortage information technology system failure military action or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issue the ultimate impact on our third party foundry and other supplier and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake fault and being consolidated in certain geographical area is unknown in the event major earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event affect or the third party system on which we rely our business could be harmed result of decline in revenue increase in expense substantial expenditure and time spent to fully resume operation if we fail to estimate customer demand properly our financial result could be harmed we manufacture our gpus and tegra processor based on estimate of customer demand and requirement we sell many of our product through channel model and our channel customer sell to retailer distributor and or end customer result the decision made by our channel partner retailer and distributor in response to changing market condition and the changing demand for our product could impact our financial result in order to have shorter shipment lead time and quicker delivery schedule for our customer we may build inventory for anticipated period of growth which do not occur may build inventory anticipating demand that doe not materialize or may build inventory to serve what we believe is pent up demand such decision may and have resulted in prolonged channel sell through we experienced with our mid range gaming gpus in fiscal year in estimating demand we make multiple assumption any of which may prove to be incorrect situation that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include change in business and economic condition including downturn in our target market and or overall economy change in consumer confidence caused by change in market condition including change in the credit market sudden and significant decrease in demand for our product higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirement our introduction of new product resulting in lower demand for older product le demand than expected for newly introduced product or increased competition including competitive pricing action the cancellation or deferral of customer purchase order could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our gross margin in addition because we often sell substantial portion of our product in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitment in timely manner in response to customer cancellation or deferral we could be required to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or market or write off excess inventory and we could experience reduction in average selling price if we incorrectly forecast product demand any of which could harm our financial result conversely if we underestimate our customer demand for our product our foundry partner may not have adequate lead time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customer order on timely basis we may also face supply constraint caused by natural disaster or other event in such case even if we are able to increase production level to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in cost effective or timely manner if we fail to fulfill our customer order on timely basis or at all our customer relationship could be damaged we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged we are subject to risk and uncertainty associated with international operation which may harm our business we conduct our business worldwide and we have office in various country outside of the united state our semiconductor wafer are manufactured assembled tested and packaged by third party located outside of the united state we also generate significant portion of our revenue from sale outside the united state we allocate revenue to individual country based on the location to which the product are initially billed even if our customer revenue is attributable to end customer that are located in different location revenue from sale outside of the united state accounted for of total revenue for each of fiscal year and revenue from billing to china including hong kong wa of our revenue for fiscal year even if our customer revenue is attributable to end customer that are located in different location additionally of january approximately of our employee were located outside of the united state the global nature of our business subject to number of risk and uncertainty which could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation including international economic and political condition including result of the united kingdom vote to withdraw from the european union and other political tension country in which we do business unexpected change in or imposition of legislative or regulatory requirement including change in tax law differing legal standard with respect to

unable to attract retain and motivate our executive and key employee we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively to be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully we must attract retain and motivate our executive and key employee the market for highly skilled worker and leader in our industry is extremely competitive in particular hiring qualified executive scientist engineer technical staff and research and development personnel is critical to our business additionally change in immigration and work permit law and regulation or the administration or interpretation of such law or regulation could impair our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employee if we are le successful in our recruiting effort or if we can not retain key employee our ability to develop and deliver successful product and service may be adversely affected additionally competition for personnel result in increased cost in the form of cash and stock based compensation the interpretation and application of employment related law to our workforce practice may result in increased operating cost and le flexibility in how we meet our workforce need effective succession planning is also important to our long term success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transition involving key employee could hinder our strategic

may also have to make royalty or other payment or cross license our technology if these arrangement are not concluded on commercially reasonable term our business could be negatively impacted furthermore the indemnification of customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expense which could negatively impact our operating result our success depends in part on protecting our intellectual property to accomplish this we rely primarily on combination of patent trademark trade secret employee and third party nondisclosure agreement licensing arrangement and the law of the country in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the united state and internationally we may be required to spend significant resource to monitor and protect our intellectual property right and even with significant expenditure we may not be able to protect our intellectual property right that are valuable to our business the law of certain foreign country may not protect our product or intellectual property right to the same extent the law of the united state this make the possibility of piracy of our technology and product more likely in addition the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secret and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our product result the value of our investment in research and development product development and marketing could be reduced we continuously ass whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovation and technology

focus on pc graphic nvidia invented the gpu to solve some of the most complex problem in computer science we have extended our focus in recent year to the revolutionary field of ai fueled by the sustained demand for better graphic and the scale of the gaming market nvidia ha evolved the gpu into computer brain at the intersection of vr hpc and ai our two reportable segment gpu and tegra processor are based on single underlying architecture from our proprietary processor we have created platform that address four large market where our expertise is critical gaming professional visualization datacenter and automotive our gpu product brand are aimed at specialized market including geforce for gamers quadro for designer tesla and dgx for ai data scientist and big data researcher and grid for cloud based visual computing user our tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto single chip and incorporates gpus and multi core cpu to drive supercomputing for autonomous robot drone and car well for game console and mobile gaming and entertainment device headquartered in santa clara california nvidia wa incorporated in california in april and reincorporated in

income from operation up net income up net income per diluted share up revenue for fiscal year increased year over year reflecting growth in each of our market platform gaming professional visualization datacenter and automotive gpu business revenue wa billion up from year earlier tegra processor business revenue which includes automotive soc module for gaming platform and embedded edge ai platform wa billion up slightly from year ago gaming revenue wa billion up from year ago driven by growth in gaming gpus gaming gpu growth wa fueled by turing based gpus for desktop and by gaming notebook based on our max technology we experienced significant volatility in our gaming revenue during fiscal year we believe demand for our desktop gaming gpu product used by end user for cryptocurrency mining and it after effect have distorted trend in gaming revenue we also believe that deteriorating macroeconomic condition particularly in china have impacted consumer demand for our geforce gaming gpu product in addition sale of certain high end geforce gaming gpus using our new turing architecture that we released during fiscal year were lower than we expected for the launch of new architecture result during portion of fiscal year we shipped higher amount of desktop gaming gpu product relative to where end user demand turned to be and subsequently compensated by shipping lower amount of desktop gaming gpu product relative to end user demand to allow the channel to work down that inventory for fiscal year we expect our gaming revenue to be slightly down compared to fiscal year with expected growth from sale of turing based gpu product and notebook gpu product partially offsetting decrease that we believe were caused by the previously noted factor professional visualization revenue wa billion up from year earlier driven by strength across both desktop and mobile workstation product datacenter revenue wa billion up from year ago led by strong sale of our volta architecture based product including nvidia tesla and dgx system toward the end of fiscal year we believe that customer across broad based vertical market and geography became increasingly cautious due to economic uncertainty and number of of contentsdatacenter deal did not close while we believe the pause is temporary our visibility remains relatively low and we do not expect meaningful recovery in the datacenter market until later in fiscal year automotive revenue of million wa up from year earlier driven by infotainment module production drive platform and development agreement with automotive company oem and ip revenue wa million down from year ago driven by the absence of intel licensing revenue which concluded in the first quarter of fiscal year revenue from cryptocurrency specific product in fiscal year and wa million and million respectively we expect revenue from cryptocurrency specific product to be negligible going forward gross margin for fiscal year wa compared with year earlier which reflects our continued shift toward higher value platform which more than offset the impact of approximately million in charge for excess dram and other component we recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and charge of million we recorded during the third quarter of fiscal year related to prior architecture component and chip operating expense for fiscal year were billion up from year earlier reflecting primarily employee addition and increase in employee compensation and other related cost including infrastructure cost income from

estimatesmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation are based upon our consolidated financial statement which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state or gaap the preparation of these financial statement requires to make estimate and judgment that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue cost of revenue expense and related disclosure of contingency on an on going basis we evaluate our estimate including those related to revenue recognition inventory income tax goodwill cash equivalent and marketable security stock based compensation and litigation investigation and settlement cost and other contingency we base our estimate on historical experience and on various other assumption that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstance the result of which form the basis for making judgment about the carrying value of asset and liability we believe the following critical accounting policy affect our significant judgment and estimate used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statement our management ha discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policy and estimate with the audit committee of our board of director the audit committee ha reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policy and estimate in this annual report on form revenue recognitionwe derive our revenue from product sale including hardware and system license and development arrangement and software licensing we determine revenue recognition through the following step identification of the contract with customer identification of the performance obligation in the contract determination of the transaction price allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligation in the contract and recognition of revenue when or we satisfy performance obligation product sale revenuerevenue from product sale is recognized upon transfer of control of promised product to customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those product revenue is recognized net of allowance for return customer program and any tax collected from customer for product sold with right of return we record reduction to revenue by establishing sale return allowance for estimated product return at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rate however if product return for fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rate we may determine that additional sale return allowance are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product return our customer program involve rebate which are designed to serve sale incentive to resellers of our product in various target market and marketing development fund or mdfs which represent monies paid to our partner that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partner activity while also promoting nvidia product we account for customer program reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebate and mdfs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customer license and development arrangementsour license and development arrangement with customer typically require significant customization of our intellectual property component result we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development service single performance obligation over the period in which the development service are performed we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project if loss on an arrangement becomes probable during period we record provision for such loss in that period software licensingour software license provide our customer with right to use the software when it is made available to the customer customer may purchase either perpetual license or subscription to license which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefit from the software software license are frequently sold along with post contract customer support or pc for such arrangement we allocate revenue to the software license and pc on relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable input to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation revenue from software license is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer pc revenue is recognized ratably over the service period or service are performed refer to note of the note to the consolidated financial statement in part iv item of this annual report on form for additional information of contentsinventoriesinventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or first in first out basis we charge cost of sale for inventory provision to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory most of our inventory provision relate to the write off of excess quantity of product based on our inventory level and future product purchase commitment compared to assumption about future demand and market condition situation that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include change in business and economic condition change in market condition sudden and significant decrease in demand for our product inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirement failure to estimate customer demand properly or unexpected competitive pricing action by our competition in addition cancellation or deferral of customer purchase order could result in our holding excess inventory the overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provision and sale of item previously written down wa an unfavorable impact of in fiscal year and insignificant in fiscal year and the higher amount of charge we took to cost of sale for inventory provision during fiscal year were primarily related to excess dram other component and prior architecture component and chip whereas the charge we took during fiscal year and were primarily related to the write off of excess quantity of gpu and tegra product whose inventory level were higher than our updated forecast of future demand for those product fable semiconductor company we must make commitment to purchase inventory based on forecast of future customer demand in doing so we must account for our third party manufacturer lead time and constraint we also adjust to other market factor such product offering and pricing action by our competitor new product transition and macroeconomic condition all of which may impact demand for our product refer to the gross profit and gross margin discussion below in this management discussion and analysis for further discussion income taxeswe recognize federal state

of any tax benefit that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized our calculation of deferred tax asset and liability is based on certain estimate and judgment and involves dealing with uncertainty in the application of complex tax law our estimate of deferred tax asset and liability may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome change in accounting standard or tax law in the united state or foreign jurisdiction where we operate or change in other fact or circumstance in addition we recognize liability for potential united state and foreign income tax contingency based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax may be due if we determine that payment of these amount is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is le than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statement accordingly of january we had valuation allowance of million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax asset that management determined are not likely to be realized due to projection of future taxable income and potential utilization limitation of tax attribute acquired result of stock ownership change to the extent realization of the deferred tax asset becomes more likely than not we would recognize such deferred tax

been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation principle of consolidationour consolidated financial statement include the account of nvidia corporation and our wholly owned subsidiary all intercompany balance and transaction have been eliminated in consolidation use of estimatesthe preparation of financial statement in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset and liability and disclosure of contingent asset and liability at the date of the financial statement and the reported amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period actual result could differ materially from our estimate on an on going basis we evaluate our estimate including those related to revenue recognition cash equivalent and marketable security account receivable inventory income tax goodwill stock based compensation litigation investigation and settlement cost restructuring and other charge and other contingency these estimate are based on historical fact and various other assumption that we believe are reasonable revenue recognitionwe derive our revenue from product sale including hardware and system license and development arrangement and software licensing we determine revenue recognition through the following step identification of the contract with customer identification of the performance obligation in the contract determination of the transaction price allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligation in the contract and recognition of revenue when or we satisfy performance obligation product sale revenuerevenue from product sale is recognized upon transfer of control of promised product to customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those product revenue is recognized net of allowance for return customer program and any tax collected from customer for product sold with right of return we record reduction to revenue by establishing sale return allowance for estimated product return at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rate however if product return for fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rate we may determine that additional sale return allowance are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product return our customer program involve rebate which are designed to serve sale incentive to resellers of our product in various target market and marketing development fund or mdfs which represent monies paid to our partner that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partner activity while also promoting nvidia product we account for customer program reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebate and mdfs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customer of contentsnvidia corporation and subsidiariesnotes to the consolidated financial statement continued license and development arrangementsour license and development arrangement with customer typically require significant customization of our intellectual property component result we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development service single performance obligation over the period in which the development service are performed we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project if loss on an arrangement becomes probable during period we record provision for such loss in that period software licensingour software license provide our customer with right to use the software when it is made available to the customer customer may purchase either perpetual license or subscription to license which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefit from the software software license are frequently sold along with post contract customer support or pc for such arrangement we allocate revenue to the software license and pc on relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable input to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation revenue from software license is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer pc revenue is recognized ratably over the service period or service are performed advertising expenseswe expense advertising cost in the period in which they are incurred advertising expense for fiscal year and were million million and million respectively product warrantieswe generally offer limited warranty to end user that range from one to three year for product in order to repair or replace product for any manufacturing defect or hardware component failure cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranty that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition under limited circumstance we may offer an extended limited warranty to customer for certain product we also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issue if loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated stock based compensationwe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant minus dividend yield discount the fair value of award of restricted stock unit or rsus and performance stock unit that are based on our corporate financial performance target or psus we use monte carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock unit that are based on market condition or market based psus the compensation expense for rsus and market based psus is recognized using straight line attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for psus is recognized using an accelerated amortization model we estimate the fair value of share to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan or espp using the black scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in march and september of each year stock based compensation for our espp is expensed using an accelerated amortization model additionally we estimate forfeiture annually based on historical experience and revise the estimate of forfeiture in subsequent period if actual forfeiture differ from those estimate litigation investigation and settlement costsfrom time to time we are involved in legal action and or investigation by regulatory body there are many uncertainty associated with any litigation or investigation and we can not be certain that these action or other third party claim against will be resolved without litigation fine and or substantial settlement payment if information becomes available that cause to determine that loss in any of our pending litigation investigation or settlement is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such event we will record the loss in accordance with gaap however the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimate which could require to record additional cost foreign currency remeasurementwe use the united state dollar our functional currency for all of our subsidiary foreign currency monetary asset and liability are remeasured into united state dollar at end of period exchange rate non monetary asset and liability such property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rate revenue and expense are remeasured at average exchange rate in effect during each period except for those expense related to the previously noted balance sheet amount which are remeasured at historical exchange rate gain or loss from foreign currency of contentsnvidia corporation and subsidiariesnotes to the consolidated financial statement continued remeasurement are included in other income or expense in our consolidated statement of income and to date have not been significant income taxeswe recognize federal state and foreign current tax liability or asset based on our estimate of tax payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax asset or liability appropriate for our estimate of future tax effect attributable to temporary difference and carryforwards and we record valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax asset by the amount of any tax benefit that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized our calculation of deferred tax asset and liability is based on certain estimate and judgment and involves dealing with uncertainty in the application of complex tax law our estimate of deferred tax asset and liability may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome change in accounting standard or tax law in the united state or foreign jurisdiction where we operate or change in other fact or circumstance in addition we recognize liability for potential united state and foreign income tax contingency based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax may be due if we determine that payment of these amount is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is le than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statement accordingly of january we had valuation allowance of million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax asset that management determined are not likely to be realized due to projection of future taxable income and potential utilization limitation of tax attribute acquired result of stock ownership change to the extent realization of the deferred tax asset becomes more likely than not we would recognize such deferred tax asset an income tax benefit during the period we recognize the benefit from tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merit of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalty related to unrecognized tax benefit component of income tax expense the tax cut and job act or tcja which wa enacted in december significantly change tax law including reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate from to requirement for company to pay one time transition tax on the earnings of certain foreign subsidiary that were previously tax deferred and the creation of new tax global intangible low taxed income or gilti on certain foreign source earnings fiscal year end taxpayer certain provision of

accounting bulletin no income tax accounting implication of the tax cut and job act sab which allowed company to record provisional amount during measurement period up to one year from the enactment date of january we completed our accounting for all of the enactment date income tax effect of the tcja and elected to account for gilti in deferred tax refer to note of these note to the consolidated

income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive share outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method under the treasury stock method the effect of equity award outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share for period when their effect is anti dilutive additionally we issued convertible note with net settlement feature that required upon conversion to settle the principal amount of debt for cash and the conversion premium for cash or share of our common stock our convertible note note hedge and related warrant contained various conversion feature which are further described in note of these note to the consolidated financial statement the potentially dilutive share resulting from the

maturity of three month or le at the time of purchase to be cash equivalent marketable securitiesmarketable security consist of highly liquid debt investment with maturity of greater than three month when purchased we generally classify our marketable security at the date of acquisition available for sale these debt security are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gain and loss

other indicator of impairment if the fair value of an available for sale debt instrument is le than it amortized cost basis an other than temporary impairment is triggered in circumstance where we intend to sell the instrument it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of it amortized cost basis or credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument in these situation we recognize an other than temporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instrument amortized cost basis and it fair value for available for sale debt instrument that are considered other than temporarily impaired due to the existence of credit loss if we do not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the instrument before recovery of it remaining amortized cost basis amortized cost basis le any current period credit loss we separate

associated with such purchase final test yield fallout and shipping cost well the cost of purchased memory product and other component part we charge cost of sale for inventory provision to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory most of our inventory provision relate to the write off of excess quantity of product based on our inventory level and future product purchase commitment compared to assumption about future demand and market condition inventory ha been written off or written down it creates new cost

our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if indicator of potential impairment exist for the purpose of completing our impairment test we perform either qualitative or quantitative analysis on reporting unit basis qualitative factor include industry and market consideration overall financial performance and other relevant event and factor affecting the reporting unit our quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate reporting unit fair value the income and market valuation approach consider number of factor that include but are not limited to prospective financial information growth rate residual value discount rate and comparable multiple from publicly traded company in our industry and require to make certain assumption and estimate regarding industry economic factor and the future profitability of our business refer to note of these note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information intangible asset and other long lived assetsintangible asset primarily represent right acquired under technology license patent acquired intellectual property trademark and customer relationship we currently amortize our intangible asset with definitive life over period ranging from three to ten year using method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefit of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or if that pattern can not be reliably determined using straight line amortization method long lived asset such property and equipment and intangible asset subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable recoverability of asset to be held and used is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flow expected to be generated by the asset or asset group if the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds it estimated future cash flow an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or

recognize change in the fair value of our equity investment through net income rather than other comprehensive income we adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year and applied it prospectively the adoption of this guidance did not have significant impact on our consolidated financial statement recent accounting pronouncement not yet adopted the fasb issued an accounting standard update regarding the accounting for lease under which we will begin recognizing lease asset and liability on the balance sheet for lease term of more than month we will adopt this guidance using the optional transition method at the beginning of fiscal year and will not restate comparative prior period additionally we will elect the package of practical expedient permitted by the guidance we are in the process of finalizing change to our system and process in conjunction with our review of lease agreement and currently expect the adoption of this accounting guidance to result in an increase in lease asset and corresponding increase in lease liability on our consolidated balance sheet of approximately million in june the fasb issued new accounting standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current gaap with methodology that reflects expected credit loss and requires consideration of broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimate we will be required to use forward looking expected credit loss model for account receivable and other financial instrument including available for sale debt security the

rate on treasury bill appropriate for the expected term our expected stock price volatility assumption for espp is estimated using historical volatility for award granted we use the dividend yield at grant date our rsu psu and market based psu award are not eligible for cash dividend prior to vesting therefore the fair value of rsus psus and market based psus are discounted for the dividend yield
