solution with multi party team that may include customer channel partner startup independent software vendor and of contentsacquisitionswe have acquired many company and we expect to make future acquisition merger and acquisition of high technology company are inherently risky especially if the acquired company ha yet to generate revenue no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisition will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our financial condition or operating result prior acquisition have resulted in wide range of outcome from successful introduction of new product and technology to an inability to do the risk associated with acquisition are more fully discussed in item risk factor including the risk factor entitled we have made and expect to continue to make acquisition that could disrupt our operation and harm our operating result investment in privately held companieswe make investment in privately held company that develop technology or provide service that are complementary to our product or that provide strategic value the risk associated with these investment are more fully discussed in item risk factor including the risk factor entitled we are exposed to fluctuation in the market value of our portfolio investment and in interest rate impairment of our investment could harm our earnings strategic allianceswe pursue strategic alliance with other company in area where collaboration can produce industry advancement and acceleration of new market the objective and goal of strategic alliance can include one or more of the following technology exchange product development joint sale and marketing or new market creation company with which we have or recently strategic alliance include the following accenture ltd apple inc at inc cap gemini citrix system inc dell technology inc lm ericsson telephone company fujitsu limited inspur group ltd intel corporation international business machine corporation italtel spa johnson control inc microsoft corporation netapp inc optum oracle corporation red hat inc sap ag sprint nextel corporation tata consultancy service ltd vmware inc wipro limited and others company with which we have strategic alliance in some area may be competitor in other area and in our view this trend may increase the risk associated with our strategic alliance are more fully discussed in item risk factor including the risk factor entitled if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliance we may not realize the expected benefit from such alliance and we may experience increased competition or delay in product development competitionwe compete in the networking and communication equipment market providing product and service for transporting data voice and video traffic across intranet extranets and the internet these market are characterized by rapid change converging technology and migration to networking and communication solution that offer relative advantage these market factor represent both an opportunity and competitive threat to we compete with numerous vendor in each product category the overall number of our competitor providing niche product solution may increase also the identity and composition of competitor may change we increase our activity in our new product market we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic region in particular we have experienced price focused competition from competitor in asia especially from china and we anticipate this will continue our competitor include amazon web service llc arista network inc arris group inc check point software technology ltd dell technology inc extreme network inc network inc fireeye inc fortinet inc hewlett packard enterprise company huawei technology co ltd juniper network inc lenovo group limited microsoft corporation new relic inc nokia corporation nutanix inc palo alto network inc symantec corporation ubiquiti network and vmware inc among others some of these company compete across many of our product line while others are primarily focused in specific product area barrier to entry are relatively low and new venture to create product that do or could compete with our product are regularly formed in addition some of our competitor may have greater resource including technical and engineering resource than we do we expand into new market we will face competition not only from our existing competitor but also from other competitor including existing company with strong technological marketing and sale position in those market we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributor of our product company with which we have strategic alliance in some area may be competitor in other area and in our view this trend may increase for example the enterprise data center is undergoing fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technology including computing networking storage and software that previously were segregated within the data center due to several factor including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessor application specific integrated circuit offering advanced service standard based protocol cloud computing and virtualization the convergence of technology within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple of contentspreviously independent technology segment also some of our current and potential competitor for enterprise data center business have made acquisition or announced new strategic alliance designed to position them to provide end to end technology solution for the enterprise data center result of all of these development we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technology including competition from entity that are among our long term strategic alliance partner company that are strategic alliance partner in some area of our business may acquire or form alliance with our competitor thereby reducing their business with the principal competitive factor in the market in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include the ability to sell successful

new customer value and product with price performance advantage the ability to reduce production cost the ability to provide value added feature such security reliability and investment protection conformance to standard market presence the ability to provide financing disruptive technology shift and new business model we also face competition from customer to which we license or supply technology and supplier from which we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability therefore we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many company any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationship with customer supplier and strategic alliance partner could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition and accordingly affect our chance of success research and developmentwe regularly introduce new product and feature to address the requirement of our market we allocate our research and development budget among our product category which consist of switching ngn routing collaboration data center wireless security service provider video and other product technology our research and development expenditure were billion billion and billion in fiscal and respectively these expenditure are applied generally to all product area with specific area of focus being identified from time to time recent area of increased focus include but are not limited to our core routing and switching product security wireless collaboration analytics and iot product our expenditure for research and development cost were expensed incurred the industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological development evolving standard change in customer requirement and new product introduction and enhancement result our success depends in part upon our ability on cost effective and timely basis to continue to enhance our existing product and to develop and introduce new product that improve performance and reduce total cost of ownership to achieve these objective our management and engineering personnel work with customer to identify and respond to customer need well with other innovator of internet working product including university laboratory and corporation we also expect to continue to make acquisition and investment where appropriate to provide with access to new technology nonetheless there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop product to address new customer requirement and technological change or that those product will achieve market acceptance manufacturingwe rely on contract manufacturer for all of our manufacturing need we presently use variety of independent third party company to provide service related to printed circuit board assembly in circuit test product repair and product assembly proprietary software on electronically programmable memory chip is used to configure product that meet customer requirement and to maintain quality control and security the manufacturing process enables to configure the hardware and software in unique combination to meet wide variety of individual customer requirement the

file with the sec are description of the risk and uncertainty that could cause our actual result to differ materially from the result contemplated by the forward looking statement contained in this report our operating result may fluctuate in future period which may adversely affect our stock price our operating result have been in the past and will continue to be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuation result of numerous factor some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuation in an uncertain global economic environment these factor include fluctuation in demand for our product and service especially with respect to service provider and internet business in part due to change in the global economic environment change in sale and implementation cycle for our product and reduced visibility into our customer spending plan and associated revenue our ability to maintain appropriate inventory level and purchase commitment price and product competition in the communication and networking industry which can change rapidly due to technological innovation and different business model from various geographic region the overall movement toward industry consolidation among both our competitor and our customer the introduction and market acceptance of new technology and product and our success in new and evolving market including in our newer product category such data center and collaboration and in emerging technology well the adoption of new standard the transformation of our business to deliver more software and subscription offering where revenue is recognized over time variation in sale channel product cost mix of product sold or mix of direct sale and indirect sale the timing size and mix of order from customer manufacturing and customer lead of content fluctuation in our gross margin and the factor that contribute to such fluctuation described below the ability of our customer channel partner contract manufacturer and supplier to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditure especially during period of global credit market disruption or in the event of customer channel partner contract manufacturer or supplier financial problem actual event circumstance outcome and amount differing from judgment assumption and estimate used in determining the value of certain asset including the amount of related valuation allowance liability and other item reflected in our consolidated financial statement how well we execute on our strategy and operating plan and the impact of change in our business model that could result in significant restructuring charge our ability to achieve targeted cost reduction benefit anticipated from our investment in engineering sale service and marketing change in tax law or accounting rule or interpretation thereofas consequence operating result for particular future period are difficult to predict and therefore prior result are not necessarily indicative of result to be expected in future period any of the foregoing factor or any other factor discussed elsewhere herein could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition that could adversely affect our stock price our operating result may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market condition and the uncertain geopolitical environment challenging economic condition worldwide have from time to time contributed and may continue to contribute to slowdown in the communication and networking industry at large well in specific segment and market in which we operate resulting in reduced demand for our product result of continued constraint on it related capital spending by our customer particularly service provider and other customer market well increased price competition for our product not only from our competitor but also consequence of customer disposing of unutilized product risk of excess and obsolete inventory risk of supply constraint risk of excess facility and manufacturing capacity higher overhead cost percentage of revenue and higher interest expensethe global macroeconomic environment ha been challenging and inconsistent instability in the global credit market the impact of uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary policy the instability in the geopolitical environment in many part of the world including result of the recent united kingdom brexit referendum to withdraw from the european union the current economic challenge in china including global economic ramification of chinese economic difficulty and other disruption may continue to put pressure on global economic condition if global economic and market condition or economic condition in key market remain uncertain or deteriorate further we may experience material impact on our business operating result and financial condition our operating result in one or more segment may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic condition particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer market within that segment for example emerging country in the aggregate experienced decline in product order during fiscal and certain prior period in addition report of certain intelligence gathering method of the government could affect customer perception of the product of it company which design and manufacture product in the united state trust and confidence in an it supplier is critical to the development and growth of our market impairment of that trust or foreign regulatory action taken in response of contentsto report of certain intelligence gathering method of the government could affect the demand for our product from customer outside of the united state and could have an adverse effect on our operating result we have been investing and expect to continue to invest in key priority and growth area well maintaining leadership in routing switching and service and if the return on these investment is lower or develops more slowly than we expect our operating result may be harmed we expect to realign and dedicate resource into key priority and growth area such security iot collaboration next generation data center cloud and software while also focusing on maintaining leadership in routing switching and service however the return on our investment may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefit anticipated from these investment including if our selection of area for investment not play out we expect or if the achievement of these benefit is delayed our operating result may be adversely affected our revenue for particular period is difficult to predict and shortfall in revenue may harm our operating result result of variety of factor discussed in this report our revenue for particular quarter is difficult to predict especially in light of challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment and related market uncertainty our revenue may grow at slower rate than in past period or decline it in fiscal on year over year basis our ability to meet financial expectation could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sale pattern seen in some of our past quarter recurs in future period we have experienced period of time during which shipment have exceeded net booking or manufacturing issue have delayed shipment leading to nonlinearity in shipping pattern in addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for particular period nonlinearity in shipping can increase cost because irregular shipment pattern result in period of underutilized capacity and period in which overtime expense may be incurred well in potential additional inventory management related cost in addition to the extent that manufacturing issue and any related component shortage result in delayed shipment in the future and particularly in period in which our contract manufacturer are operating at higher level of capacity it is possible that revenue for quarter could be adversely affected if such matter occur and are not remediated within the same quarter the timing of large order can also have significant effect on our business and operating result from quarter to quarter primarily in the united state and in emerging country from time to time we receive large order that have significant effect on our operating result in the period in which the order is recognized revenue the timing of such order is difficult to predict and the timing of revenue recognition from such order may affect period to period change in revenue result our operating result could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such order and their ultimate recognition revenue inventory management remains an area of focus we have experienced longer than normal manufacturing lead time in the past which have caused some customer to place the same order multiple time within our various sale channel and to cancel the duplicative order upon receipt of the product or to place order with other vendor with shorter manufacturing lead time such multiple ordering along with other factor or risk of order cancellation may cause difficulty in predicting our revenue and result could impair our ability to manage part inventory effectively in addition our effort to improve manufacturing lead time performance may result in corresponding reduction in order backlog decline in backlog level could result in more variability and le predictability in our quarter to quarter revenue and operating result in addition when facing component supply related challenge we have increased our effort in procuring component in order to meet customer expectation which in turn contribute to an increase in purchase commitment increase in our purchase commitment to shorten lead time could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charge if the demand for our product is le than our expectation we plan our operating expense level based primarily on forecasted revenue level these expense and the impact of long term commitment are relatively fixed in the short term shortfall in revenue could lead to operating result being below expectation because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expense in response to short term business change any of the factor could have material adverse impact on our operation and financial result we expect gross margin to vary over time and our level of product gross margin may not be sustainable our product gross margin declined in fiscal and in certain other prior period and could decline in future quarter due to adverse impact from various factor including change in customer geographic or product mix including mix of configuration within each product of content introduction of new product including product with price performance advantage and new business model including the transformation of our business to deliver more software and subscription offering our ability to reduce production cost entry into new market or growth in lower margin market including market with different pricing and cost structure through acquisition or internal development sale discount increase in material labor or other manufacturing related cost which could be significant especially during period of supply constraint such those impacting the market for memory component excess inventory and inventory holding charge obsolescence charge change in shipment volume the timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferral increased cost loss of cost saving or dilution of saving due to change in component pricing or charge incurred due to inventory holding period if part ordering doe not correctly anticipate product demand or if the financial health of either contract manufacturer or supplier deteriorates lower than expected benefit from value engineering increased price competition including competitor from asia especially from china change in distribution channel increased warranty cost increased amortization of purchased intangible asset especially from acquisition how well we execute on our strategy and operating planschanges in service gross margin may result from various factor such change in the mix between technical support service and advanced service well the timing of technical support service contract initiation and renewal and the addition of personnel and other resource to support higher level of service business in future period sale to the service provider market are especially volatile and weakness in order from this industry may harm our operating result and financial condition sale to the service provider market have been characterized by large and sporadic purchase especially relating to our router sale and sale of certain product in our newer product category such data center collaboration and service provider video in addition to longer sale cycle product order from the service provider market decreased in fiscal and at various time in the past we have experienced significant weakness in product order from service provider product order from the service provider market could continue to decline and ha been the case in the past such weakness could persist over extended period of time given fluctuating market condition sale activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructure the availability of funding and the extent to which service provider are affected by regulatory economic and business condition in the country of operation weakness in order from this industry including result of any slowdown in capital expenditure by service provider which may be more prevalent during global economic downturn or period of economic political or regulatory uncertainty could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition such slowdown may continue or recur in future period order from this industry could decline for many reason other than the competitiveness of our product and service within their respective market for example in the past many of our service provider customer have been materially and adversely affected by slowdown in the general economy by overcapacity by change in the service provider market by regulatory development and by constraint on capital availability resulting in business failure and substantial reduction in spending and expansion plan these condition have materially harmed our business and operating result in the past and some of these or other condition in the service provider market could affect our business of contentsand operating result in any future period finally service provider customer typically have longer implementation cycle require broader range of service including design service demand that vendor take on larger share of risk often require acceptance provision which can lead to delay in revenue recognition and expect financing from vendor all these factor can add further risk to business conducted with service provider disruption of or change in our distribution model could harm our sale and margin if we fail to manage distribution of our product and service properly or if our distributor financial condition or operation weaken our revenue and gross margin could be adversely affected substantial portion of our product and service is sold through our channel partner and the remainder is sold through direct sale our channel partner include system integrator service provider other resellers and distributor system integrator and service provider typically sell directly to end user and often provide system installation technical support professional service and other support service in addition to network equipment sale system integrator also typically integrate our product into an overall solution and number of service provider are also system integrator distributor stock inventory and typically sell to system integrator service provider and other resellers we refer to sale through distributor our two tier system of sale to the end customer revenue from distributor is generally recognized based on sell through method using information provided by them these distributor are generally given business term that allow them to return portion of inventory receive credit for change in selling price and participate in various cooperative marketing program if sale through indirect channel increase this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our product and to degree the timing of order from our customer historically we have seen fluctuation in our gross margin based on change in the balance of our distribution channel although variability to date ha not been significant there can be no assurance that change in the balance of our distribution model in future period would not have an adverse effect on our gross margin and profitability some factor could result in disruption of or change in our distribution model which could harm our sale and margin including the following we compete with some of our channel partner including through our direct sale which may lead these channel partner to use other supplier that do not directly sell their own product or otherwise compete with them some of our channel partner may demand that we absorb greater share of the risk that their customer may ask them to bear some of our channel partner may have insufficient financial resource and may not be able to withstand change and challenge in business condition revenue from indirect sale could suffer if our distributor financial condition or operation weakenin addition we depend on our channel partner globally to comply with applicable regulatory requirement to the extent that they fail to do so that could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition further sale of our product outside of agreed territory can result in disruption to our distribution channel the market in which we compete are intensely competitive which could adversely affect our achievement of revenue growth the market in which we compete are characterized by rapid change converging technology and migration to networking and communication solution that offer relative advantage these market factor represent competitive threat to we compete with numerous vendor in each product category the overall number of our competitor providing niche product solution may increase also the identity and composition of competitor may change we increase our activity in newer product category such data center and collaboration and in key priority and growth area for example product related to network programmability such sdn product become more prevalent we expect to face increased competition from company that develop networking product based on commoditized hardware referred to white box hardware to the extent customer decide to purchase those product offering instead of in addition the growth in demand for technology delivered service enables new competitor to enter the market we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic region in particular we have experienced price focused competition from competitor in asia especially from china and we anticipate this will continue for information regarding our competitor see the section entitled competition contained in item business of this report some of our competitor compete across many of our product line while others are primarily focused in specific product area barrier to entry are relatively low and new venture to create product that do or could compete with our product are regularly of contentsformed in addition some of our competitor may have greater resource including technical and engineering resource than we do we expand into new market we will face competition not only from our existing competitor but also from other competitor including existing company with strong technological marketing and sale position in those market we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributor of our product company with which we have strategic alliance in some area may be competitor in other area and in our view this trend may increase for example the enterprise data center is undergoing fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technology including computing networking storage and software that previously were segregated due to several factor including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessor asics offering advanced service standard based protocol cloud computing and virtualization the convergence of technology within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple previously independent technology segment also some of our current and potential competitor for enterprise data center business have made acquisition or announced new strategic alliance designed to position them to provide end to end technology solution for the enterprise data center result of all of these development we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technology including competition from entity that are among our long term strategic alliance partner company that are strategic alliance partner in some area of our business may acquire or form alliance with our competitor thereby reducing their business with the principal competitive factor in the market in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include the ability to sell successful business outcome the ability to provide broad range of networking and communication product and service product performance price the ability to introduce new product including providing continuous new customer value and product with price performance advantage the ability to reduce production cost the ability to provide value added feature such security reliability and investment protection conformance to standard market presence the ability to provide financing disruptive technology shift and new business modelswe also face competition from customer to which we license or supply technology and supplier from which we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability such we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many company any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationship with customer supplier and strategic alliance partner could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition and accordingly affect our chance of success our inventory management relating to our sale to our two tier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margin we must manage our inventory relating to sale to our distributor effectively because inventory held by them could affect our result of operation our distributor may increase order during period of product shortage cancel order if their inventory is high or delay order in anticipation of new product they also may adjust their order in response to the supply of our product and the product of our competitor that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuation in end user demand revenue to our distributor generally is recognized based on sell through method using information provided by them and they are generally given business term that allow them to return portion of inventory receive credit for change in selling price and participate in various cooperative marketing program inventory management remains an area of focus we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory level to ensure competitive lead time against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirement when facing component supply related challenge we have increased our effort of contentsin procuring component in order to meet customer expectation if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our price and write inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margin supply chain issue including financial problem of contract manufacturer or component supplier or shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity that increased our cost or caused delay in our ability to fulfill order could have an adverse impact on our business and operating result and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply which could adversely affect our gross margin the fact that we do not own or operate the bulk of our manufacturing facility and that we are reliant on our extended supply chain could have an adverse impact on the supply of our product and on our business and operating result any financial problem of either contract manufacturer or component supplier could either limit supply or increase cost reservation of manufacturing capacity at our contract manufacturer by other company inside or outside of our industry could either limit supply or increase cost industry consolidation occurring within one or more component supplier market such the semiconductor market could either limit supply or increase costsa reduction or interruption in supply significant increase in the price of one or more component failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturer failure to appropriately cancel reschedule or adjust our requirement based on our business need or decrease in demand for our product could materially adversely affect our business operating result and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationship furthermore result of binding price or purchase commitment with supplier we may be obligated to purchase component at price that are higher than those available in the current market in the event that we become committed to purchase component at price in excess of the current market price when the component are actually used our gross margin could decrease we have experienced longer than normal lead time in the past although we have generally secured additional supply or taken other mitigation action when significant disruption have occurred if similar situation occur in the future they could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition see the risk factor above entitled our revenue for particular period is difficult to predict and shortfall in revenue may harm our operating result our growth and ability to meet customer demand depend in part on our ability to obtain timely delivery of part from our supplier and contract manufacturer we have experienced component shortage in the past including shortage caused by manufacturing process issue that have affected our operation we may in the future experience shortage of certain component part result of our own manufacturing issue manufacturing issue at our supplier or contract manufacturer capacity problem experienced by our supplier or contract manufacturer including capacity or cost problem resulting from industry consolidation or strong demand in the industry for those part growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressure on and our supplier to accurately project overall component demand and component demand within specific product category and to establish optimal component level and manufacturing capacity especially for labor intensive component component for which we purchase substantial portion of the supply or the ramping of manufacturing capacity for highly complex product during period of shortage or delay the price of component may increase or the component may not be available at all and we may also encounter shortage if we do not accurately anticipate our need we may not be able to secure enough component at reasonable price or of acceptable quality to build new product in timely manner in the quantity or configuration needed accordingly our revenue and gross margin could suffer until other source can be developed our operating result would also be adversely affected if anticipating greater demand than actually develops we commit to the purchase of more component than we need which is more likely to occur in period of demand uncertainty such we are currently experiencing there can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problem in the future although in many case we use standard part and component for our product certain component are presently available only from single source or limited source and global economic downturn and related market uncertainty could negatively impact the availability of component from one or more of these source especially during time such we have recently seen when there are supplier constraint based on labor and other action taken during economic downturn we may not be able to diversify source in timely manner which could harm our ability to deliver product to customer and seriously impact present and future sale we believe that we may be faced with the following challenge in the future new market in which we participate may grow quickly which may make it difficult to quickly obtain significant component of content we acquire company and new technology we may be dependent at least initially on unfamiliar supply chain or relatively small supply partner we face competition for certain component that are supply constrained from existing competitor and company in other marketsmanufacturing capacity and component supply constraint could continue to be significant issue for we purchase component from variety of supplier and use several contract manufacturer to provide manufacturing service for our product during the normal course of business in order to improve manufacturing lead time performance and to help ensure adequate component supply we enter into agreement with contract manufacturer and supplier that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criterion defined by or that establish the parameter defining our requirement in certain instance these agreement allow the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirement based on our business need prior to firm order being placed when facing component supply related challenge we have increased our effort in procuring component in order to meet customer expectation which in turn contributes to an increase in purchase commitment increase in our purchase commitment to shorten lead time could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charge if the demand for our product is le than our expectation if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly an oversupply of part could result in excess or obsolete component that could adversely affect our gross margin for additional information regarding our purchase commitment with contract manufacturer and supplier see note to the consolidated financial statement we depend upon the development of new product and enhancement to existing product and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trend and customer changing need our operating result and market share may suffer the market for our product are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standard new product introduction and evolving method of building and operating network our operating result depend on our ability to develop and introduce new product into existing and emerging market and to reduce the production cost of existing product many of our strategic initiative and investment we have made and our architectural approach are designed to enable the increased use of the network the platform for automating orchestrating integrating and delivering an ever increasing array of it based product and service for example in june we announced our catalyst series of switch which represent the initial foundation of our intent based networking capability other current initiative include our focus on security the market transition related to digital transformation and iot the transition in cloud and the move towards more programmable flexible and virtual network the process of developing new technology including intent based networking more programmable flexible and virtual network and technology related to other market transition such security digital transformation and iot and cloud is complex and uncertain and if we fail to accurately predict customer changing need and emerging technological trend our business could be harmed we must commit significant resource including the investment we have been making in our priority to developing new product before knowing whether our investment will result in product the market will accept in particular if our model of the evolution of networking doe not emerge we believe it will or if the industry doe not evolve we believe it will or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful many of our strategic initiative and investment may be of no or limited value for example if we do not introduce product related to network programmability such software defined networking product in timely fashion or if product offering in this market that ultimately succeed are based on technology or an approach to technology that differs from ours such for example networking product based on white box hardware our business could be harmed similarly our business could be harmed if we fail to develop or fail to develop in timely fashion offering to address other transition or if the offering addressing these other transition that ultimately succeed are based on technology or an approach to technology different from ours in addition our business could be adversely affected in period surrounding our new product introduction if customer delay purchasing decision to qualify or otherwise evaluate the new product offering our strategy is to lead our customer in their digital transition with solution that deliver greater agility productivity security and other advanced network capability and that intelligently connect nearly everything that can be connected over the last year we have been transforming our business to move from selling individual product and service to selling product and service integrated into architecture and solution and we are seeking to meet the evolving need of customer which include offering our product and solution in the manner in which customer wish to consume them part of this transformation we continue to make change to how we are organized and how we build and deliver our technology including change in our business model with customer if our strategy for addressing our customer need or the architecture and solution we develop do not meet those need or the change we are making in how we are organized and how we build and deliver or technology is incorrect or ineffective our business could be harmed furthermore we may not execute successfully on our vision or strategy because of challenge with regard to product planning and timing technical hurdle that we fail to overcome in timely fashion or lack of appropriate resource this could result in competitor some of which may also be our strategic alliance partner providing those solution before we do and loss of market of contentsshare revenue and earnings in addition the growth in demand for technology delivered service enables new competitor to enter the market the success of new product depends on several factor including proper new product definition component cost timely completion and introduction of these product differentiation of new product from those of our competitor and market acceptance of these product there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunity develop and bring new product to market in timely manner or achieve market acceptance of our product or that product and technology developed by others will not render our product or technology obsolete or noncompetitive the product and technology in our other product category and key priority and growth area may not prove to have the market success we anticipate and we may not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or new product change in industry structure and market condition could lead to charge related to discontinuance of certain of our product or business asset impairment and workforce reduction or restructuringsin response to change in industry and market condition we may be required to strategically realign our resource and to consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting business any resource realignment or decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit business may result in the recording of special charge such inventory and technology related write offs workforce reduction or restructuring cost charge relating to consolidation of excess facility or claim from third party who were resellers or user of discontinued product our estimate with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of asset including purchased intangible asset could change result of such assessment and decision although in certain instance our supply agreement allow the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirement based on our business need prior to firm order being placed our loss contingency may include liability for contract that we can not cancel with contract manufacturer and supplier further our estimate relating to the liability for excess facility are affected by change in real estate market condition additionally we are required to perform goodwill impairment test on an annual basis and between annual test in certain circumstance and future goodwill impairment test may result in charge to earnings in august we announced restructuring plan under which we began taking action in the first quarter of fiscal in may we extended the restructuring plan to include additional employee the implementation of this restructuring plan may be disruptive to our business and following completion of the restructuring plan our business may not be more efficient or effective than prior to implementation of the plan our restructuring activity including any related charge and the impact of the related headcount restructurings could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition over the long term we intend to invest in engineering sale service and marketing activity and these investment may achieve delayed or lower than expected benefit which could harm our operating result while we intend to focus on managing our cost and expense over the long term we also intend to invest in personnel and other resource related to our engineering sale service and marketing function we realign and dedicate resource on key priority and growth area such security iot collaboration next generation data center cloud and software and we also intend to focus on maintaining leadership in routing switching and service we are likely to recognize the cost associated with these investment earlier than some of the anticipated benefit and the return on these investment may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefit anticipated from these investment or if the achievement of these benefit is delayed our operating result may be adversely affected our business substantially depends upon the continued growth of the internet and internet based system substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth and evolution of the internet including the continued development of the internet and the anticipated market transition and on the deployment of our product by customer who depend on such continued growth and evolution to the extent that an economic slowdown or uncertainty and related reduction in capital spending adversely affect spending on internet infrastructure including spending or investment related to anticipated market transition we could experience material harm to our business operating result and financial condition because of the rapid introduction of new product and changing customer requirement related to matter such cost effectiveness and security we believe that there could be performance problem with internet communication in the future which could receive high degree of publicity and visibility because we are large supplier of networking product our business operating result and financial condition may be materially adversely affected regardless of whether or not these problem are due to the performance of our own product such an event could also result in material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock independent of direct effect on our business of contentswe have made and expect to continue to make acquisition that could disrupt our operation and harm our operating result our growth depends upon market growth our ability to enhance our existing product and our ability to introduce new product on timely basis we intend to continue to address the need to develop new product and enhance existing product through acquisition of other company product line technology and personnel acquisition involve numerous risk including the following difficulty in integrating the operation system technology product and personnel of the acquired company particularly company with large and widespread operation and or complex product diversion of management attention from normal daily operation of the business and the challenge of managing larger and more widespread operation resulting from acquisition potential difficulty in completing project associated with in process research and development intangible difficulty in entering market in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitor in such market have stronger market position initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chain or relatively small supply partner insufficient revenue to offset increased expense associated with acquisition the potential loss of key employee customer distributor vendor and other business partner of the company we acquire following and continuing after announcement of acquisition plansacquisitions may also cause to issue common stock that would dilute our current shareholder percentage ownership use substantial portion of our cash resource or incur debt significantly increase our interest expense leverage and debt service requirement if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition assume liability record goodwill and intangible asset that are subject to impairment testing on regular basis and potential periodic impairment charge incur amortization expense related to certain intangible asset incur tax expense related to the effect of acquisition on our intercompany cost sharing arrangement and legal structure incur large and immediate write offs and restructuring and other related expense become subject to intellectual property or other litigationmergers and acquisition of high technology company are inherently risky and subject to many factor outside of our control and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisition will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operating result or financial condition failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisition could materially harm our business and operating result prior acquisition have resulted in wide range of outcome from successful introduction of new product and technology to failure to do so even when an acquired company ha already developed and marketed product there can be no assurance that product enhancement will be made in timely fashion or that pre acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issue that might arise with respect to such product from time to time we have made acquisition that resulted in charge in an individual quarter these charge may occur in any particular quarter resulting in variability in our quarterly earnings in addition our effective tax rate for future period is uncertain and could be impacted by merger and acquisition risk related to new product development also apply to acquisition see the risk factor above including the risk factor entitled we depend upon the development of new product and enhancement to of contentsexisting product and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trend and customer changing need our operating result and market share may suffer for additional information entrance into new or developing market expose to additional competition and will likely increase demand on our service and support operation we focus on new market opportunity and key priority and growth area we will increasingly compete with large telecommunication equipment supplier well startup company several of our competitor may have greater resource including technical and engineering resource than we do additionally customer in these market complete infrastructure deployment they may require greater level of service support and financing than we have provided in the past especially in emerging country demand for these type of service support or financing contract may increase in the future there can be no assurance that we can provide product service support and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunity further provision of greater level of service support and financing by may result in delay in the timing of revenue recognition in addition entry into other market ha subjected and will subject to additional risk particularly to those market including the effect of general market condition and reduced consumer confidence for example we add direct selling capability globally to meet changing customer demand we will face increased legal and regulatory requirement industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating result there ha been trend toward industry consolidation in our market for several year we expect this trend to continue company attempt to strengthen or hold their market position in an evolving industry and company are acquired or are unable to continue operation for example some of our current and potential competitor for enterprise data center business have made acquisition or announced new strategic alliance designed to position them with the ability to provide end to end technology solution for the enterprise data center company that are strategic alliance partner in some area of our business may acquire or form alliance with our competitor thereby reducing their business with we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitor that are better able to compete sole source vendor for customer this could lead to more variability in our operating result and could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition furthermore particularly in the service provider market rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customer with the effect that loss of major customer could have material impact on result not anticipated in customer marketplace composed of more numerous participant product quality problem could lead to reduced revenue gross margin and net income we produce highly complex product that incorporate leading edge technology including both hardware and software software typically contains bug that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operation there can be no assurance that our pre shipment testing program will be adequate to detect all defect either one in individual product or one that could affect numerous shipment which might interfere with customer satisfaction reduce sale opportunity or affect gross margin from time to time we have had to replace certain component and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defect or bug in product that we had shipped there can be no assurance that such remediation depending on the product involved would not have material impact an inability to cure product defect could result in the failure of product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from product or market damage to our reputation inventory cost or product reengineering expense any of which could have material impact on our revenue margin and net income for example in the second quarter of fiscal we recorded charge to product cost of sale of million related to the expected remediation cost for anticipated failure in future period of widely used component sourced from third party which is included in several of our product and in the second quarter of fiscal we recorded pre tax charge of million related to the expected remediation cost for certain product sold in prior fiscal year containing memory component manufactured by single supplier between and due to the global nature of our operation political or economic change or other factor in specific country or region could harm our operating result and financial conditionwe conduct significant sale and customer support operation in country around the world such our growth depends in part on our increasing sale into emerging country we also depend on non operation of our contract manufacturer component supplier and distribution partner emerging country in the aggregate experienced decline in order during fiscal and certain prior period we continue to ass the sustainability of any improvement in these country and there can be no assurance that our investment in these country will be successful our future result could be materially adversely affected by variety of political economic or other factor relating to our operation inside and outside the united state including impact from global central bank monetary policy issue related to the political relationship between the united state and other country that can affect the willingness of customer in those country to purchase product from company headquartered in the united state and the challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment any or all of which could have material adverse effect of contentson our operating result and financial condition including among others the following foreign currency exchange rate political or social unrest economic instability or weakness or natural disaster in specific country or region including the current economic challenge in china and global economic ramification of chinese economic difficulty instability result of brexit environmental and trade protection measure and other legal and regulatory requirement some of which may affect our ability to import our product to export our product from or sell our product in various country political consideration that affect service provider and government spending pattern health or similar issue such pandemic or epidemic difficulty in staffing and managing international operation adverse tax consequence including imposition of withholding or other tax on our global operationswe are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customer and to credit exposure in weakened market which could result in material loss most of our sale are on an open credit basis with typical payment term of day in the united state and because of local custom or condition longer in some market outside the united state we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangement seek to limit such open credit to amount we believe the customer can pay and maintain reserve we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful account beyond our open credit arrangement we have also experienced demand for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangement we expect demand for customer financing to continue and recently we have been experiencing an increase in this demand the credit market have been impacted by the challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment including increased demand from customer in certain emerging country we believe customer financing is competitive factor in obtaining business particularly in serving customer involved in significant infrastructure project our loan financing arrangement may include not only financing the acquisition of our product and service but also providing additional fund for other cost associated with network installation and integration of our product and service our exposure to the credit risk relating to our financing activity described above may increase if our customer are adversely affected by global economic downturn or period of economic uncertainty although we have program in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk including monitoring of particular risk in certain geographic area there can be no assurance that such program will be effective in reducing our credit risk in the past there have been significant bankruptcy among customer both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangement particularly among internet business and service provider causing to incur economic or financial loss there can be no assurance that additional loss will not be incurred although these loss have not been material to date future loss if incurred could harm our business and have material adverse effect on our operating result and financial condition portion of our sale is derived through our distributor these distributor are generally given business term that allow them to return portion of inventory receive credit for change in selling price and participate in various cooperative marketing program we maintain estimated accrual and allowance for such business term however distributor tend to have more limited financial resource than other resellers and end user customer and therefore represent potential source of increased credit risk because they may be more likely to lack the reserve resource to meet payment obligation additionally to the degree that turmoil in the credit market make it more difficult for some customer to obtain financing those customer ability to pay could be adversely impacted which in turn could have material adverse impact on our business operating result and financial condition we are exposed to fluctuation in the market value of our portfolio investment and in interest rate impairment of our investment could harm our earnings we maintain an investment portfolio of various holding type and maturity these security are generally classified available for sale and consequently are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gain or loss reported component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax our portfolio includes fixed income security and equity investment in publicly traded company the value of which are subject to market price volatility to the extent unhedged if such investment suffer market price decline we experienced with some of our investment in the past we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investment below their cost basis when the decline is judged to be other than temporary for information regarding the sensitivity of and risk associated with the market value of portfolio investment and of contentsinterest rate refer to the section titled quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our investment in private company are subject to risk of loss of investment capital these investment are inherently risky because the market for the technology or product they have under development are typically in the early stage and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these company we are exposed to fluctuation in currency exchange rate that could negatively impact our financial result and cash flow because significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united state we face exposure to adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rate these exposure may change over time business practice evolve and they could have material adverse impact on our financial result and cash flow historically our primary exposure have related to nondollar denominated sale in japan canada and australia and certain nondollar denominated operating expense and service cost of sale in europe latin america and asia where we sell primarily in dollar additionally we have exposure to emerging market currency which can have extreme currency volatility an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customer of our product in those market outside the united state where we sell in dollar and weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expense and procurement of raw material to the extent that we must purchase component in foreign currency currently we enter into foreign exchange forward contract and option to reduce the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuation on certain foreign currency receivables investment and payable in addition we periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flow our attempt to hedge against these risk may result in an adverse impact on our net income our proprietary right may prove difficult to enforce we generally rely on patent copyright trademark and trade secret law to establish and maintain proprietary right in our technology and product although we have been issued numerous patent and other patent application are currently pending there can be no assurance that any of these patent or other proprietary right will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that our right will in fact provide competitive advantage to furthermore many key aspect of networking technology are governed by industrywide standard which are usable by all market entrant in addition there can be no assurance that patent will be issued from pending application or that claim allowed on any patent will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition the law of some foreign country may not protect our proprietary right to the same extent do the law of the united state the outcome of any action taken in these foreign country may be different than if such action were determined under the law of the united state although we are not dependent on any individual patent or group of patent for particular segment of the business for which we compete if we are unable to protect our proprietary right to the totality of the feature including aspect of product protected other than by patent right in market we may find at competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense time and effort required to create innovative product that have enabled to be successful we may be found to infringe on intellectual property right of others third party including customer have in the past and may in the future assert claim or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property right to technology and related standard that are relevant to these assertion have increased over time result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claim assertion particularly in the united state because of the existence of large number of patent in the networking field the secrecy of some pending patent and the rapid rate of issuance of new patent it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether product or any of it component infringes or will infringe on the patent right of others the asserted claim and or initiated litigation can include claim against or our manufacturer supplier or customer alleging infringement of their proprietary right with respect to our existing or future product or component of those product regardless of the merit of these claim they can be time consuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require to develop non infringing technology or enter into license agreement where claim are made by customer resistance even to unmeritorious claim could damage customer relationship there can be no assurance that license will be available on acceptable term and condition if at all or that our indemnification by our supplier will be adequate to cover our cost if claim were brought directly against or our customer furthermore because of the potential for high court award that are not necessarily predictable it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claim settled for significant amount if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against by any third party is successful if we are required to indemnify customer with respect to claim against the customer or if we fail to develop non infringing technology or license the proprietary right on commercially reasonable term and condition our business operating result and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected for additional information regarding our indemnification obligation see note to the consolidated financial statement contained in this report our exposure to risk associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased result of acquisition we have lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against of contentsinfringement risk further in the past third party have made infringement and similar claim after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition we rely on the availability of third party license many of our product are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third party it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew license relating to various aspect of these product there can be no assurance that the necessary license would be available on acceptable term if at all the inability to obtain certain license or other right or to obtain such license or right on favorable term or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matter could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our product of software or other intellectual property licensed from third party on nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary right in our product our operating result may be adversely affected and damage to our reputation may occur due to production and sale of counterfeit version of our productsas is the case with leading product around the world our product are subject to effort by third party to produce counterfeit version of our product while we work diligently with law enforcement authority in various country to block the manufacture of counterfeit good and to interdict their sale and to detect counterfeit product in customer network and have succeeded in prosecuting counterfeiter and their distributor resulting in fine imprisonment and restitution to there can be no guarantee that such effort will succeed while counterfeiter often aim their sale at customer who might not have otherwise purchased our product due to lack of verifiability of origin and service such counterfeit sale to the extent they replace otherwise legitimate sale could adversely affect our operating result our operating result and future prospect could be materially harmed by uncertainty of regulation of the internet currently few law or regulation apply directly to access or commerce on the internet we could be materially adversely affected by regulation of the internet and internet commerce in any country where we operate such regulation could include matter such voice over the internet or using ip encryption technology sale or other tax on internet product or service sale and access charge for internet service provider the adoption of regulation of the internet and internet commerce could decrease demand for our product and at the same time increase the cost of selling our product which could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition change in telecommunication regulation and tariff could harm our prospect and future sale change in telecommunication requirement or regulatory requirement in other industry in which we operate in the united state or other country could affect the sale of our product in particular we believe that there may be future change in telecommunication regulation that could slow the expansion of the service provider network infrastructure and materially adversely affect our business operating result and financial condition including net neutrality rule to the extent they impact decision on investment in network infrastructure future change in tariff by regulatory agency or application of tariff requirement to currently untariffed service could affect the sale of our product for certain class of customer additionally in the united state our product must comply with various requirement and regulation of the federal communication commission and other regulatory authority in country outside of the united state our product must meet various requirement of local telecommunication and other industry authority change in tariff or failure by to obtain timely approval of product could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition failure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objective our success ha always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical managerial sale and marketing personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially in the silicon valley area of northern california stock incentive plan are designed to reward employee for their long term contribution and provide incentive for them to remain with volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or equity incentive award or change to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program resulting from the management of share dilution and share based compensation expense or otherwise may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employee result of one or more of these factor we may increase our hiring in geographic area outside the united state which could subject to additional geopolitical and exchange rate risk the loss of service of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delay in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sale personnel could make it difficult to meet key objective such timely and effective product introduction in addition company in our industry whose employee accept of contentspositions with competitor frequently claim that competitor have engaged in improper hiring practice we have received these claim in the past and may receive additional claim to this effect in the future adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigation may harm our operating result or financial condition we are party to lawsuit in the normal course of our business litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operation moreover the result of complex legal proceeding are difficult to predict for example brazilian authority have investigated our brazilian subsidiary and certain of it former employee well brazilian importer of our product and it affiliate and employee relating to alleged evasion of import tax and alleged improper transaction involving the subsidiary and the importer brazilian tax authority have assessed claim against our brazilian subsidiary based on theory of joint liability with the brazilian importer for import tax interest and penalty the asserted claim by brazilian federal tax authority which remain are for calendar year through and the asserted claim by the tax authority from the state of sao paulo are for calendar year through the total asserted claim by brazilian state and federal tax authority aggregate to million for the alleged evasion of import and other tax billion for interest and billion for various penalty all determined using an exchange rate of july we have completed thorough review of the matter and believe the asserted claim against our brazilian subsidiary are without merit and we are defending the claim vigorously while we believe there is no legal basis for the alleged liability due to the complexity and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process in brazil and the nature of the claim asserting joint liability with the importer we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against our brazilian subsidiary and are unable to reasonably estimate range of loss if any we do not expect final judicial determination for several year an unfavorable resolution of lawsuit or governmental investigation could have material adverse effect on our business operating result or financial condition for additional information regarding certain of the matter in which we are involved see item legal proceeding contained in part of this report change in our provision for income tax or adverse outcome resulting from examination of our income tax return could adversely affect our result our provision for income tax is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in country that have lower tax rate and higher than anticipated in country that have higher tax rate by change in the valuation of our deferred tax asset and liability by change to domestic manufacturing deduction law regulation or interpretation thereof by expiration of or lapse in tax incentive by transfer pricing adjustment including the effect of acquisition on our intercompany cost sharing arrangement and legal structure by tax effect of nondeductible compensation by tax cost related to intercompany realignments by change in accounting principle or by change in tax law and regulation treaty or interpretation thereof including possible change to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiary the deductibility of expense attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rule significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income tax the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd an international association comprised of country including the united state ha recently made change to numerous long standing tax principle there can be no assurance that these change adopted by country will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income tax further result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment action and commitment our income in certain country is subject to reduced tax rate our failure to meet these commitment could adversely impact our provision for income tax in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax return by the internal revenue service and other tax authority we regularly ass the likelihood of adverse outcome resulting from these examination to determine the adequacy of our provision for income tax there can be no assurance that the outcome from these continuous examination will not have an adverse effect on our operating result and financial condition our business and operation are especially subject to the risk of earthquake flood and other natural catastrophic event our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operation are located in the silicon valley area of northern california region known for seismic activity additionally certain number of our facility are located near river that have experienced flooding in the past also certain of our supplier and logistics center are located in region that have been or may be affected by earthquake tsunami and flooding activity which in the past ha disrupted and in the future could disrupt the flow of component and delivery of product significant natural disaster such an earthquake hurricane volcano or flood could have material adverse impact on our business operating result and financial condition of contentsman made problem such cyber attack data protection breach computer virus or terrorism may disrupt our operation harm our operating result and damage our reputation and cyber attack or data protection breach on our customer network or in cloud based service provided by or enabled by could result in liability for damage our reputation or otherwise harm our businessdespite our implementation of network security measure the product and service we sell to customer and our server data center and the cloud based solution on which our data and data of our customer supplier and business partner are stored are vulnerable to cyber attack data protection breach computer virus and similar disruption from unauthorized tampering or human error any such event could compromise our network or those of our customer and the information stored on our network or those of our customer could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen which could subject to liability to our customer supplier business partner and others and could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition and may cause damage to our reputation effort to limit the ability of malicious third party to disrupt the operation of the internet or undermine our own security effort may be costly to implement and meet with resistance and may not be successful breach of network security in our customer network or in cloud based service provided by or enabled by regardless of whether the breach is attributable to vulnerability in our product or service could result in liability for damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business in addition the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat or any future act of terrorism may cause further disruption to the economy of the united state and other country and create further uncertainty or otherwise materially harm our business operating result and financial condition likewise event such loss of infrastructure and utility service such energy transportation or telecommunication could have similar negative impact to the extent that such disruption or uncertainty result in delay or cancellation of customer order or the manufacture or shipment of our product our business operating result and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliance we may not realize the expected benefit from such alliance and we may experience increased competition or delay in product development we have several strategic alliance with large and complex organization and other company with which we work to offer complementary product and service and in the past have established joint venture to market service associated with our cisco unified computing system product these arrangement are generally limited to specific project the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standard there can be no assurance we will realize the expected benefit from these strategic alliance or from the joint venture if successful these relationship may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth however alliance carry an element of risk because in most case we must compete in some business area with company with which we have strategic alliance and at the same time cooperate with that company in other business area also if these company fail to perform or if these relationship fail to materialize expected we could suffer delay in product development or other operational difficulty joint venture can be difficult to manage given the potentially different interest of joint venture partner our stock price may be volatile historically our common stock ha experienced substantial price volatility particularly result of variation between our actual financial result and the published expectation of analyst and result of announcement by our competitor and furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition result of operation business security of our product or significant transaction can cause change in our stock price in addition the stock market ha experienced extreme price and volume fluctuation that have affected the market price of many technology company in particular and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these company these factor well general economic and political condition and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisition or other significant transaction or any difficulty associated with such transaction by or our current or potential competitor may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future additionally volatility lack of positive performance in our stock price or change to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program may adversely affect our ability to retain key employee virtually all of are compensated in part based on the performance of our stock price of contentsthere can be no assurance that our operating result and financial condition will not be adversely affected by our incurrence of debt of the end of fiscal we have senior unsecured note outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of billion that mature at specific date from calendar year through we have also established commercial paper program under which we may issue short term unsecured commercial paper note on private placement basis up to maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of billion and we had billion commercial paper note outstanding under this program of july the outstanding senior unsecured note bear fixed rate interest payable semiannually except billion of the note which bear interest at floating rate payable quarterly the fair value of the long term debt is subject to market interest rate volatility the instrument governing the senior unsecured note contain certain covenant applicable to and our wholly owned subsidiary that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain lien or engage in certain type of sale and leaseback transaction in addition we will be required to have available in the united state sufficient cash to service the interest on our debt and repay all of our note on maturity there can be no assurance that our incurrence of this debt or any future debt will be better mean of providing liquidity to than would our use of our existing cash resource including cash currently held offshore further we can not be assured that our maintenance of this indebtedness or incurrence of future indebtedness will not adversely affect our operating result or financial condition in addition change by any rating agency to our credit rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity security well the term upon which we may borrow under our commercial paper program or future debt issuance item unresolved staff commentsnot

consolidated financial statement item legal proceeding brazil brazilian authority have investigated our brazilian subsidiary and certain of it former employee well brazilian importer of our product and it affiliate and employee relating to alleged evasion of import tax and alleged improper transaction involving the subsidiary and the importer brazilian tax authority have assessed claim against our brazilian subsidiary based on theory of joint liability with the brazilian importer for import tax interest and penalty in addition to claim asserted by the brazilian federal tax authority in prior fiscal year tax authority from the brazilian state of sao paulo have asserted similar claim on the same legal basis in prior fiscal year the asserted claim by brazilian federal tax authority that remain are for calendar year through and the asserted claim by the tax authority from the state of sao paulo are for calendar year through the total asserted claim by brazilian state and federal tax authority aggregate to million for the alleged evasion of import and other tax billion for interest and billion for various penalty all determined using an exchange rate of july we have completed thorough review of the matter and believe the asserted claim against our brazilian subsidiary are without merit and we are defending the claim vigorously while we believe there is no legal basis for the alleged liability due to the complexity and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process in brazil and the nature of the claim asserting joint liability with the importer we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against our brazilian subsidiary and are unable to reasonably estimate range of loss if any we do not expect final judicial determination for several

contentscritical accounting estimatesthe preparation of financial statement and related disclosure in conformity with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state requires to make judgment assumption and estimate that affect the amount reported in the consolidated financial statement and accompanying note note to the consolidated financial statement describes the significant accounting policy and method used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statement the accounting policy described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimate such accounting policy require significant judgment assumption and estimate used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statement and actual result could differ materially from the amount reported based on these policy revenue recognition revenue is recognized when all of the following criterion have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists contract internet commerce agreement and customer purchase order are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement delivery ha occurred shipping document and customer acceptance when applicable are used to verify delivery for software delivery is considered to have occurred upon unrestricted license access and license term commencement when applicable the fee is fixed or determinable we ass whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment term associated with the transaction and whether the sale price is subject to refund or adjustment collectibility is reasonably assured we ass collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer determined by credit check and analysis well the customer payment history in instance where final acceptance of the product system or solution is specified by the customer revenue is deferred until all acceptance criterion have been met when sale involves multiple deliverable such sale of product that include service the multiple deliverable are evaluated to determine the unit of accounting and the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criterion for each unit of accounting are met for hosting arrangement we recognize revenue ratably over the hosting period while usage revenue is recognized based on utilization software subscription revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the subscription term upon delivery of the first product and commencement of the term the amount of revenue recognized in given period is affected by our judgment to whether an arrangement includes multiple deliverable and if so our valuation of the unit of accounting our multiple element arrangement may contain only deliverable within the scope of accounting standard codification asc revenue recognition deliverable within the scope of asc software revenue recognition or combination of both according to the accounting guidance prescribed in asc we use vendor specific objective evidence of selling price vsoe for each of those unit when available we determine vsoe based on our normal pricing and discounting practice for the specific product or service when sold separately in determining vsoe we require that substantial majority of the historical standalone transaction have the selling price for product or service fall within reasonably narrow pricing range generally evidenced by approximately of such historical standalone transaction falling within plus or minus of the median rate when vsoe doe not exist we apply the selling price hierarchy to applicable multiple deliverable arrangement under the selling price hierarchy third party evidence of selling price tpe will be considered if vsoe doe not exist and estimated selling price esp will be used if neither vsoe tpe is available generally we are not able to determine tpe because our go to market strategy differs from that of others in our market and the extent of our proprietary technology varies among comparable product or service from those of our peer in determining esp we apply significant judgment we weigh variety of factor based on the characteristic of the deliverable we typically arrive at an esp for product or service that is not sold separately by considering company specific factor such geography competitive landscape internal cost profitability objective pricing practice used to establish bundled pricing and existing portfolio pricing and discounting our business and offering evolve over time our pricing practice may be required to be modified accordingly which could result in change in selling price including both vsoe and esp in subsequent period there were no material impact during fiscal nor do we currently expect material impact in the next month on our revenue recognition due to any change in our vsoe tpe or esp we make sale to distributor which we refer to two tier sale to the end customer revenue from two tier distributor is recognized based on sell through method using point of sale information provided by these distributor distributor participate in various cooperative marketing and other incentive program and we maintain estimated accrual and allowance for these program if actual credit received by distributor under these program were to deviate significantly from our estimate which are based on historical experience our revenue could be adversely affected of contentsallowances for receivables and sale returnsthe allowance for receivables were follows in million except percentage july july for doubtful account of gross account receivable allowance for credit loss lease receivables of gross lease receivables allowance for credit loss loan receivables of gross loan receivables calculated allowance for credit loss on lease receivables percentage of gross lease receivables and residual value before unearned income the allowance for doubtful account is based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer account we regularly review the adequacy of these allowance by considering internal factor such historical experience credit quality and age of the receivable balance well external factor such economic condition that may affect customer ability to pay well historical and expected default frequency rate which are published by major third party credit rating agency and are updated on quarterly basis we also consider the concentration of receivables outstanding with particular customer in assessing the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful account if major customer creditworthiness deteriorates if actual default are higher than our historical experience or if other circumstance arise our estimate of the recoverability of amount due to could be overstated and additional allowance could be required which could have an adverse impact on our operating result the allowance for credit loss on financing receivables is also based on the assessment of collectibility of customer account we regularly review the adequacy of the credit allowance determined either on an individual or collective basis when evaluating the financing receivables on an individual basis we consider historical experience credit quality and age of receivable balance and economic condition that may affect customer ability to pay when evaluating financing receivables on collective basis we use expected default frequency rate published by major third party credit rating agency well our own historical loss rate in the event of default while also systematically giving effect to economic condition concentration of risk and correlation determining expected default frequency rate and loss factor associated with internal credit risk rating well assessing factor such economic condition concentration of risk and correlation are complex and subjective our ongoing consideration of all these factor could result in an increase in our allowance for credit loss in the future which could adversely affect our operating result both account receivable and financing receivables are charged off at the point when they are considered uncollectible reserve for future sale return is established based on historical trend in product return rate the reserve for future sale return of july and july wa million and million respectively and wa recorded reduction of our account receivable and revenue if the actual future return were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established our revenue could be adversely affected inventory valuation and liability for purchase commitment with contract manufacturer and suppliersinventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventory determined primarily by future demand forecast inventory write down are measured the difference between the cost of the inventory and market based upon assumption about future demand and are charged to the provision for inventory which is component of our cost of sale at the point of the loss recognition new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent change in fact and circumstance do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis we record liability for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitment with contract manufacturer and supplier for quantity in excess of our future demand forecast consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory of july the liability for these purchase commitment wa million compared with million of july and wa included in other current liability our provision for inventory wa million million and million in fiscal and respectively the provision for the liability related to purchase commitment with contract manufacturer and supplier wa million million and million in fiscal and respectively if there were to be sudden and significant decrease in demand for our product or if there were higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirement we could be required to increase our inventory write down and our liability for purchase commitment with contract manufacturer and supplier and accordingly our profitability could be adversely affected we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write down and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitment of contentsinventory and supply chain management remain area of focus we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead time with the risk of inventory obsolescence particularly in light of current macroeconomic uncertainty and condition and the resulting potential for change in future demand forecast loss contingency and product warrantieswe are subject to the possibility of various loss arising in the ordinary course of business we consider the likelihood of impairment of an asset or the incurrence of liability well our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingency an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset ha been impaired or liability ha been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we regularly evaluate information available to to determine whether such accrual should be made or adjusted and whether new accrual are required third party including customer have in the past and may in the future assert claim or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property right to technology and related standard that are relevant to these assertion have increased over time result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claim assertion particularly in the united state if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against by any third party is successful or if we fail to develop non infringing technology or license the proprietary right on commercially reasonable term and condition our business operating result and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected in fiscal we recorded charge to product cost of sale of million resulting from failure related to product containing memory component manufactured by single supplier between and we perform regular assessment of the sufficiency of this liability and reduced the amount by million and million in fiscal and fiscal respectively based on updated analysis during the second quarter of fiscal we further reduced the liability by million to reflect lower than expected defect actual usage history and estimated lower future remediation cost more of the impacted product age and near the end of the support period covered by the remediation program in addition during the second quarter of fiscal we recorded million charge to product cost of sale related to the expected remediation cost for anticipated failure in future period of widely used component sourced from third party which is included in several of our product the liability related to the supplier component remediation matter of july and july wa million and million respectively estimating these liability is complex and subjective and if we experience change in number of underlying assumption and estimate such change in claim compared with our expectation or if the cost of servicing these claim is different than expected our estimated liability for these matter may be impacted our product are generally covered by warranty for period ranging from day to five year and for some product we provide limited lifetime warranty we accrue for warranty cost part of our cost of sale based on associated material cost technical support labor cost and associated overhead material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trend in the volume of product return within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trend in the rate of customer case and the cost to support the customer case within the warranty period overhead cost is applied based on estimated time to support warranty activity if we experience an increase in warranty claim compared with our historical experience or if the cost of servicing warranty claim is greater than expected our profitability could be adversely affected fair value measurementsour fixed income and publicly traded equity security collectively are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value of billion of july compared with billion of july our fixed income investment portfolio of july consisted primarily of high quality investment grade security see note to the consolidated financial statement described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statement valuation hierarchy is based on the level of independent objective evidence available regarding the value of the investment it encompasses three class of investment level consists of security for which there are quoted price in active market for identical security level consists of security for which observable input other than level input are used such quoted price for similar security in active market or quoted price for identical security in le active market and model derived valuation for which the variable are derived from or corroborated by observable market data and level consists of security for which there are unobservable input to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of contentsour level security are valued using quoted market price for similar instrument or nonbinding market price that are corroborated by observable market data we use input such actual trade data benchmark yield broker dealer quote and other similar data which are obtained from independent pricing vendor quoted market price or other source to determine the ultimate fair value of our asset and liability we use such pricing data the primary input to which we have not made any material adjustment during fiscal and to make our assessment and determination to the ultimate valuation of our investment portfolio we are ultimately responsible for the financial statement and underlying estimate the input and fair value are reviewed for reasonableness may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information and could be adjusted based on market index or other information that management deems material to it estimate of fair value the assessment of fair value can be difficult and subjective however given the relative reliability of the input we use to value our investment portfolio and because substantially all of our valuation input are obtained using quoted market price for similar or identical asset we do not believe that the nature of estimate and assumption affected by level of subjectivity and judgment wa material to the valuation of the investment portfolio of july level asset do not represent significant portion of our total asset measured at fair value on recurring basis of july and july other than temporary impairment we recognize an impairment charge when the decline in the fair value of our fixed income or publicly traded equity security below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary the ultimate value realized on these security to the extent unhedged is subject to market price volatility until they are sold if the fair value of debt security is le than it amortized cost we ass whether the impairment is other than temporary an impairment is considered other than temporary if we have the intent to sell the security ii it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of it entire amortized cost basis or iii we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security if an impairment is considered other than temporary based on or ii described in the prior sentence the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the security is recognized in earnings if an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition iii the amount representing credit loss defined the difference between the present value of the cash flow expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security will be recognized in earnings and the amount relating to all other factor will be recognized in other comprehensive income oci in estimating the amount and timing of cash flow expected to be collected we consider all available information including past event current condition the remaining payment term of the security the financial condition of the issuer expected default and the value of underlying collateral for publicly traded equity security we consider various factor in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge including the length of time and extent to which the fair value ha been le than our cost basis the financial condition and near term prospect of the issuer and our intent and ability to hold the investment for period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value we also have investment in privately held company some of which are in the startup or development stage of july our investment in privately held company were million compared with million of july and were included in other asset we monitor these investment for event or circumstance indicative of potential impairment and we make appropriate reduction in carrying value if we determine that an impairment charge is required based primarily on the financial condition and near term prospect of these company these investment are inherently risky because the market for the technology or product these company are developing are typically in the early stage and may never materialize goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairmentsour methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisition is determined through established valuation technique goodwill represents residual value of the acquisition date which in most case result in measuring goodwill an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net asset acquired including contingent consideration we perform goodwill impairment test on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual test in certain circumstance for each reporting unit the assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible asset is based on factor that market participant would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial asset the goodwill recorded in the consolidated balance sheet of july and july wa billion and billion respectively the increase in goodwill during fiscal wa due in large part to our acquisition of appdynamics in response to change in industry and market condition we could be required to strategically realign our resource and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting business which could result in an impairment of goodwill there wa no impairment of goodwill in fiscal and for the annual impairment testing in fiscal the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting unit wa billion for the america billion for emea and billion for apjc of contentsduring the fourth quarter of fiscal we performed sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting unit and determined that hypothetical decline in the fair value of each reporting unit would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit the fair value of acquired technology and patent well acquired technology under development is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach which discount expected future cash flow to present value the discount rate used in the present value calculation are typically derived from weighted average cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risk inherent in the development lifecycle appropriate we consider the pricing model for product related to these acquisition to be standard within the high technology communication industry and the applicable discount rate represent the rate that market participant would use for valuation of such intangible asset we make judgment about the recoverability of purchased intangible asset with finite life whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that an impairment may exist recoverability of purchased intangible asset with finite life is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flow the asset is expected to generate we review indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment annually or whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the asset might be impaired if the asset is considered to be impaired the amount of any impairment is measured the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset assumption and estimate about future value and remaining useful life of our purchased intangible asset are complex and subjective they can be affected by variety of factor including external factor such industry and economic trend and internal factor such change in our business strategy and our internal forecast our impairment charge related to purchased intangible asset were million million and million during fiscal and respectively our ongoing consideration of all the factor described previously could result in additional impairment charge in the future which could adversely affect our net income income taxeswe are subject to income tax in the united state and numerous foreign jurisdiction our effective tax rate differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of state tax foreign operation tax credit domestic manufacturing deduction tax audit settlement nondeductible compensation international realignments and transfer pricing adjustment our effective tax rate wa and in fiscal and respectively significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax position and determining our provision for income tax although we believe our reserve are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matter will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provision and accrual we adjust these reserve in light of changing fact and circumstance such the closing of tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matter is different than the amount recorded such difference will impact the provision for income tax in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income tax includes the impact of reserve provision and change to reserve that are considered appropriate well the related net interest and penalty significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax asset in assessing the need for valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating result estimate of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategy in the event that we change our determination to the amount of deferred tax asset that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with corresponding impact to the provision for income tax in the period in which such determination is made our provision for income tax is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in country that have lower tax rate and higher than anticipated in country that have higher tax rate by change in the valuation of our deferred tax asset and liability by change to domestic manufacturing deduction law regulation or interpretation thereof by expiration of or lapse in tax incentive by transfer pricing adjustment including the effect of acquisition on our intercompany cost sharing arrangement and legal structure by tax effect of nondeductible compensation by tax cost related to intercompany realignments by change in accounting principle or by change in tax law and regulation treaty or interpretation thereof including possible change to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiary the deductibility of expense attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rule significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income tax the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd an international association comprised of country including the united state ha recently made change to numerous long standing tax principle there can be no assurance that these change once adopted by country will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income tax result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment action and commitment our income in certain country is subject to reduced tax rate our failure to meet these commitment could adversely impact our provision for income tax in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax return by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authority we regularly ass the likelihood of adverse outcome resulting from these examination to determine the adequacy of our provision for income tax there can be no assurance that the outcome from these continuous examination will not have an adverse impact on our operating result and financial condition of contentsresults of operationsrevenuethe following table present the breakdown of revenue between product and service in million except

partially offset by increase in the other two bricm country in addition to the impact of macroeconomic factor including reduced it spending environment and reduction in spending by government entity revenue by segment in particular period may be significantly impacted by several factor related to revenue recognition including the complexity of transaction such multiple element arrangement the mix

approximately on combined basis inventory and purchase commitment with contract manufacturer and supplier increased by compared with the end of fiscal the increase in inventory wa due to an increase in raw material due to securing memory supply which is currently constrained and higher level of manufactured finished good in support of current order activity the increase in purchase commitment with contract manufacturer and supplier wa due to securing memory supply and procuring key component for specific product area we believe our inventory and purchase commitment level are in line with our current demand forecast our finished good consist of distributor inventory and deferred cost of sale and manufactured finished good distributor inventory and deferred cost of sale are related to unrecognized revenue on shipment to distributor and retail partner well shipment to customer manufactured finished good consist primarily of build to order and build to stock product we purchase

time and help ensure adequate component supply we enter into agreement with contract manufacturer and supplier that allow them to procure inventory based upon criterion defined by or that establish the parameter defining our requirement and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity significant portion of our reported purchase commitment arising from these agreement are firm noncancelable and unconditional commitment in certain instance these agreement allow the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirement based on our business need prior to firm order being placed our purchase commitment are for short term product manufacturing requirement well for commitment to supplier to secure manufacturing capacity inventory and supply chain management remain area of focus we

process research and development ipr based on their estimated fair value the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these identifiable asset and liability is recorded goodwill ipr is initially capitalized at fair value an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter when an ipr project is completed the ipr is reclassified an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortized over the asset estimated useful life acquisition related expense and related restructuring cost are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed incurred goodwill and purchased intangible asset goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and when specific circumstance dictate between annual test when impaired the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value the goodwill impairment test involves two step process the first step identifying potential impairment compare the fair value of reporting unit with it carrying amount including goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds it fair value the second step would need to be conducted otherwise no further step are necessary no potential impairment exists if necessary the second step to measure the impairment loss would be to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill any excess of the reporting unit goodwill carrying value over the respective implied fair value is recognized an impairment loss purchased intangible asset with finite life are carried at cost le accumulated amortization amortization is computed over the estimated useful life of the respective asset see long lived asset for the company policy regarding impairment testing of purchased intangible asset with finite life purchased intangible asset with indefinite life are assessed for potential impairment annually or when event or circumstance indicate that their carrying amount might be impaired long lived asset long lived asset that are held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable determination of recoverability of long lived asset is based on an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flow resulting from the use of the asset and it eventual disposition measurement of an impairment loss for long lived asset that management expects to hold and use is based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and it carrying value long lived asset to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value le cost to sell fair value fair value is defined the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date when determining the fair value measurement for asset and liability required or permitted to be either recorded or disclosed at fair value the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and it also considers assumption that market participant would use when pricing the asset or liability of contentsthe accounting guidance for fair value measurement requires an entity to maximize the use of observable input and minimize the use of unobservable input when measuring fair value the standard establishes fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent objective evidence surrounding the input used to measure fair value financial instrument categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the fair value hierarchy is follows level applies to asset or liability for which there are quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability level applies to asset or liability for which there are input other than quoted price that are observable for the asset or liability such quoted price for similar asset or liability in active market quoted price for identical asset or liability in market with insufficient volume or infrequent transaction le active market or model derived valuation in which significant input are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data level applies to asset or liability for which there are unobservable input to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the asset or liability derivative instrument the company recognizes derivative instrument either asset or liability and measure those instrument at fair value the accounting for change in the fair value of derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation for derivative instrument designated fair value hedge the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributed to the risk being hedged for derivative instrument designated cash flow hedge the effective portion of the derivative gain or loss is initially reported component of aoci and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affect earnings the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately for derivative instrument designated net investment hedge of the company foreign operation the gain or loss is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment within aoci together with the offsetting loss or gain of the hedged exposure of the underlying foreign operation any ineffective portion of the net investment hedge is reported in earnings during the period of change for derivative instrument that are not designated accounting hedge change in fair value are recognized in earnings in the period of change the company record derivative instrument in the statement of cash flow to operating investing or financing activity consistent with the cash flow of the hedged item hedge effectiveness for foreign exchange forward contract used cash flow hedge is assessed by comparing the change in the fair value of the hedge contract with the change in the fair value of the forecasted cash flow of the hedged item hedge effectiveness for equity forward contract and foreign exchange net investment hedge forward contract is assessed by comparing change in fair value due to change in spot rate for both the derivative and the hedged item for foreign exchange option contract hedge effectiveness is assessed based on the hedging instrument entire change in fair value hedge effectiveness for interest rate swap is assessed by comparing the change in fair value of the swap with the change in the fair value of the hedged item due to change in the benchmark interest rate foreign currency translation asset and liability of non subsidiary that operate in local currency environment where that local currency is the functional currency are translated to dollar at exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date with the resulting translation adjustment directly recorded to separate component of aoci income and expense account are translated at average exchange rate during the year remeasurement adjustment are recorded in other income loss net the effect of foreign currency exchange rate on cash and cash equivalent wa not material for any of the fiscal year presented concentration of risk cash and cash equivalent are maintained with several financial institution deposit held with bank may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposit generally these deposit may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institution with reputable credit and therefore bear minimal credit risk the company seek to mitigate it credit risk by spreading such risk across multiple counterparties and monitoring the risk profile of these counterparties the company performs ongoing credit evaluation of it customer and with the exception of certain financing transaction doe not require collateral from it customer the company receives certain of it component from sole supplier additionally the company relies on limited number of contract manufacturer and supplier to provide manufacturing service for it product the inability of contract manufacturer or supplier to fulfill supply requirement of the company could materially impact future operating result revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery ha occurred the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured in instance where final acceptance of the product system or solution is specified by the customer revenue is deferred until all acceptance criterion have been met for hosting arrangement the company recognizes revenue ratably over the hosting period while usage revenue is recognized based on utilization software subscription revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the subscription term upon delivery of the first product and commencement of the term technical support and consulting service revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the service are to be performed which is typically from one to three year transactional advanced service revenue is recognized upon delivery or completion of performance milestone of contentsthe company us distributor that typically stock inventory and sell to system integrator service provider and other resellers the company refers to this it two tier sale to the end customer revenue from distributor is recognized based on sell through method using point of sale information provided by the distributor distributor and other partner participate in various rebate cooperative marketing and other incentive program and the company maintains estimated accrual and allowance for these program the ending liability for these program wa included in other current liability and the balance of july and july wa billion and billion respectively the company accrues for warranty cost sale return and other allowance based on it historical experience shipping and handling fee billed to customer are included in revenue with the associated cost included in cost of sale many of the company product have both software and non software component that function together to deliver the product essential functionality the company also provides technical support and advanced service the company ha broad customer base that encompasses virtually all type of public and private entity including enterprise business service provider and commercial customer the company and it salesforce are not organized by product division and the company product and service can be sold standalone or together in various combination across the company geographic segment or customer market for example service provider arrangement are typically larger in scale with longer deployment schedule and involve the delivery of variety of product technology including high end routing video and network management software and other product technology along with technical support and advanced service the company enterprise and commercial arrangement are unique for each customer and smaller in scale and may include network infrastructure product such router and switch or collaboration technology such unified communication and cisco telepresence system product along with technical support service the company enters into revenue arrangement that may consist of multiple deliverable of it product and service offering due to the need of it customer for example customer may purchase routing product along with contract for technical support service this arrangement would consist of multiple element with the product delivered in one reporting period and the technical support service delivered across multiple reporting period another customer may purchase networking product along with advanced service offering in which all the element are delivered within the same reporting period in addition distributor purchase product or technical support service on standalone basis for resale to an end user or for purpose of stocking certain product and these transaction would not result in multiple element arrangement the company considers several factor when reviewing multiple purchase made by the same customer within short time frame in order to identify multiple element arrangement including whether the deliverable are closely interrelated whether the deliverable are essential to each other functionality whether payment term are linked whether the customer is entitled to refund or concession if another purchase is not completed satisfactorily and or whether the purchase were negotiated together one overall arrangement in many instance product are sold separately in standalone arrangement customer may support the product themselves or purchase support on time and material basis advanced service are sometimes sold in standalone engagement such general consulting network management or security advisory project and technical support service are sold separately through renewal of annual contract the company determines it vendor specific objective evidence vsoe based on it normal pricing and discounting practice for product or service when sold separately vsoe determination requires that substantial majority of the historical standalone transaction ha the selling price for product or service that fall within reasonably narrow pricing range generally evidenced by approximately of such historical standalone transaction falling within plus or minus of the median rate in addition the company considers the geography in which the product or service are sold major product and service group and customer classification and other environmental or marketing variable in determining vsoe when the company is not able to establish vsoe for all deliverable in an arrangement with multiple element which may be due to the company infrequently selling each element separately not pricing product within narrow range or only having limited sale history such in the case of certain newly introduced product category the company attempt to determine the selling price of each element based on third party evidence of selling price tpe tpe is determined based on competitor price for similar deliverable when sold separately generally the company go to market strategy differs from that of it peer and it offering contain significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of product with similar functionality can not be obtained furthermore the company is unable to reliably determine what similar competitor product selling price are on standalone basis therefore the company is typically not able to determine tpe when the company is unable to establish fair value using vsoe or tpe the company us estimated selling price esp in it allocation of arrangement consideration the objective of esp is to determine the price at which the company would transact sale if the product or service were regularly sold on standalone basis esp is generally used for new or highly proprietary offering and solution or for offering not priced within reasonably narrow range the company determines esp for product or service by considering multiple factor including but not limited to geography market condition competitive landscape internal cost gross margin objective and pricing practice the determination of esp is made through consultation with and formal approval by the company management taking into consideration the go to market strategy of contentsthe company regularly review vsoe tpe and esp and maintains internal control over the establishment and update of these estimate there were no material impact during the fiscal year nor doe the company currently expect material impact in the near term from change in vsoe tpe or esp the company arrangement with multiple deliverable may include one or more software deliverable that are subject to the software revenue recognition guidance in these case revenue for the software is generally recognized upon shipment or electronic delivery and granting of the license the revenue for these multiple element arrangement is allocated to the software deliverable and the non software deliverable based on the relative selling price of all of the deliverable in the arrangement using the hierarchy in the applicable accounting guidance in the circumstance where the company can not determine vsoe or tpe of the selling price for all of the deliverable in the arrangement including the software deliverable esp is used for the purpose of performing this allocation vsoe is required to allocate the revenue between multiple software deliverable if vsoe is available for the undelivered software element the company applies the residual method where vsoe is not available software revenue is either recognized when all software element have been delivered or recognized ratably when post contract support is the only undelivered software element remaining advertising cost the company expense all advertising cost incurred advertising cost included within sale and marketing expense were approximately million million and million for fiscal and respectively share based compensation expense the company measure and recognizes the compensation expense for all share based award made to employee and director including employee stock option restricted stock unit rsus prsus and employee stock purchase related to the employee stock purchase plan employee stock purchase right based on estimated fair value the fair value of employee stock option is estimated on the date of grant using lattice binomial option pricing model lattice binomial model or the black scholes model and for employee stock purchase right the company estimate the fair value using the black scholes model the fair value for time based stock award and stock award that are contingent upon the achievement of financial performance metric is based on the grant date share price reduced by the present value of the expected dividend yield prior to vesting the fair value of market based stock award is estimated using an option pricing model on the date of grant share based compensation expense is reduced for forfeiture software development cost software development cost including cost to develop software sold leased or otherwise marketed that are incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility are capitalized if significant cost incurred during the application development stage for internal use software are capitalized if significant capitalized software development cost are amortized using the straight line amortization method over the estimated useful life of the applicable software such software development cost required to be capitalized have not been material to date income tax income tax expense is based on pretax financial accounting income deferred tax asset and liability are recognized for the expected tax consequence of temporary difference between the tax base of asset and liability and their reported amount valuation allowance are recorded to reduce deferred tax asset to the amount that will more likely than not be realized the company account for uncertainty in income tax using two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax position the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeal or litigation process if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement the company classifies the liability for unrecognized tax benefit current to the extent that the company anticipates payment or receipt of cash within one year interest and penalty related to uncertain tax position are recognized in the provision for income tax computation of net income per share basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common share outstanding during the period diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common share and dilutive potential common share outstanding during the period diluted share outstanding includes the dilutive effect of in the money option unvested restricted stock and restricted stock unit the dilutive effect of such equity award is calculated based on the average share price for each fiscal period using the treasury stock method under the treasury stock method the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock option the

deductible are collectively assumed to be used to repurchase share consolidation of variable interest entity the company us qualitative approach in assessing the consolidation requirement for variable interest entity the approach focus on identifying which enterprise ha the power to direct the activity that most significantly impact the variable interest entity economic performance and which enterprise ha the obligation to absorb loss or the right to receive benefit from the variable interest entity in the event that the company is the primary beneficiary of variable interest entity the asset liability and result of operation of the variable interest entity will be included in the company consolidated financial statement of content use of estimate the preparation of financial

of revenue from software arrangement where revenue wa previously deferred in prior period and recognized ratably over time required under the current standard this preliminary assessment is based on the type and number of revenue arrangement currently in place the exact impact of the new standard will be dependent on fact and circumstance at adoption and could vary from quarter to quarter in addition to the above revenue recognition timing impact the new standard will require incremental contract acquisition cost such sale commission for customer contract to be capitalized and amortized over the contract period currently these cost are expensed incurred cisco will be required to record cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings upon adopting the new standard at the beginning of fiscal the most significant of these adjustment will be to reduce product deferred revenue and increase retained earnings at the date of adoption to reflect revenue that would have been already recognized under the new standard related to existing arrangement there will also be an adjustment to increase account receivable and reduce inventory related to the change in revenue recognition on
