contained on our website is not incorporated by reference in or considered to be part of this report our industry we are global semiconductor company semiconductor are component used in variety of electronic product and system an integrated circuit ic is semiconductor device that consists of many interconnected transistor on single chip since the invention of the transistor in improvement in ic process and design technology have led to the development of smaller complex and more reliable ic at lower cost per function the microprocessor and chipset market central processing unit cpu microprocessor is an ic that serf the cpu of computer it generally consists of hundred of million or billion of transistor that process data in serial fashion and control other device in the system acting the brain of the computer the performance of microprocessor is critical factor impacting the performance of computing and entertainment platform such desktop pc notebook and workstation the principal element used to measure cpu performance are work per cycle or many instruction are executed per cycle clock speed representing the rate at which cpu internal logic operates measured in unit of gigahertz or billion of cycle per second and power consumption other factor impacting microprocessor performance include the process technology used in it manufacture the number and type of core the bit size of it instruction set bit bit memory size and data access speed development in ic design and manufacturing process technology have resulted in significant advance in microprocessor performance since business and consumer require greater performance from their computer system due to the growth of digital data and increasingly sophisticated software application multi core microprocessor offer enhanced overall system performance and efficiency computing task can be spread across two or more processing core each of which can execute task at full speed multi core microprocessor can simultaneously increase performance of computer system without greatly increasing the total amount of power consumed and the total amount of heat emitted business and consumer also require computer system with improved power management technology which help to reduce the power consumption of their computer system enables smaller and more portable form factor and lower the total cost of ownership processing unit gpu gpu is programmable logic chip that help render image animation and video and is increasingly being used to handle general computing task gpus are located in plug in card discrete processor or in chip on the motherboard or in the chip the cpu part of an accelerated processing unit apu or system on chip soc gpus on stand alone card or discrete gpus on the motherboard typically access their memory while gpus in the chipset or cpu chip share main memory with the cpu gpus perform parallel operation on data to render image for video display and are essential to presenting computer generated image on that display decoding and rendering animation and displaying video the more sophisticated the gpu the higher the resolution and the faster and smoother moving object can be displayed on video display or in virtual environment virtual and augmented reality in addition to graphic processing gpus are used to perform parallel operation on multiple set of data and are increasingly used to perform vector processing for non graphic application that require repetitive computation such supercomputing deep learning artificial and machine intelligence and various other application cryptocurrency mining accelerated processing unit apu consumer increasingly demand computing device with improved end user experience system performance and energy efficiency consumer also continue to demand thinner and lighter mobile device with better performance and longer battery life we believe that computing architecture that optimizes the use of it component can provide these improvement an apu is processing unit that integrates cpu and gpu onto one chip or one piece of silicon along with in some case other special purpose component this integration enhances system performance by offloading selected task to the best suited component the cpu or the gpu to optimize component use increasing the speed of data flow between the cpu and gpu through shared memory and allowing the gpu to function graphic engine and an application accelerator the cpu and gpu on the same chip also typically improves energy efficiency by for example eliminating connection between discrete chip heterogeneous system architecture hsa describes an industry standard that is an overarching design for having combination of cpu and gpu processor core that operate unified integrated engine that share system responsibility and resource amd is founding member of the hsa foundation non profit organization established to define and promote this open standard based approach to heterogeneous computing heterogeneous computing allows for the elevation of the gpu to the same level of the cpu for memory access queuing and execution this capability allows software programmer to develop application to more fully utilize gpu capability system on chip soc an soc is type of ic with cpu gpu and other component such memory controller and peripheral management comprising complete computing system on single chip by combining all of these element an soc system performance and energy efficiency is improved similar to an apu chipset chipset is generic term referring to collection of system level component that manage data flow among microprocessor or microprocessor memory and peripheral such cd rom drive dvd drive and usb peripheral chipsets perform essential logic function balance system performance and provide system control and power management function some chipsets have graphic capability by including an integrated graphic processor igp within the chipset chipset with an igp is known an igp chipset igp chipsets can offer lower cost reduced power alternative to discrete gpu and are often also used in smaller form factor system that are powered by an apu or by cpu and discrete gpu combination often do not have chipset and instead use an amd controller hub chip to perform the function of chipset result we believe that either an apu and amd controller hub chip combination or an soc which already includes chipset will eventually replace the market for igp chipsets our microprocessor and chipset productsour microprocessor are incorporated into computing platform which are collection of technology that are designed to work together to provide more complete computing solution and to enable and advance the computing component we believe that integrated balanced computing platform consisting of microprocessor chipsets either discrete device or integrated into an soc and gpus either discrete gpus or integrated into an apu or soc that work together at the system level bring end user improved system stability increased performance and enhanced power efficiency in addition we believe our customer also benefit from an all amd platform consisting of an apu or cpu discrete gpu and an amd fusion controller hub chip when needed we are able to optimize interoperability provide our customer single point of contact for the key platform component and enable them to bring the platform to market faster in variety of client and server system form factor currently base our microprocessor and chipsets on the instruction set architecture and the amd direct connect architecture which connects an on chip memory controller and input output channel directly to one or more microprocessor core we typically integrate two or more processor core onto single die and each core ha it own dedicated cache which is memory that is located on the semiconductor die permitting quick access to frequently

of our product against price reduction we also sell directly to our si customer si typically sell from position of regional or product based strength in the market they usually operate on short design cycle and can respond quickly with new technology si often use discrete graphic solution mean to differentiate their product and add value to their customer competition in the microprocessor and chipset marketintel corporation ha been the market share leader for microprocessor for many year intel market share margin and significant financial resource enable it to market it product aggressively to target our customer and our channel partner with special incentive and to influence customer who do business with these aggressive activity have in the past resulted in lower unit sale and lower average selling price for many of our product and adversely affected our margin and profitability intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturer and their channel of distribution through various brand and other marketing program result of intel position in the microprocessor market intel ha been able to control microprocessor and computer system standard and benchmark and to dictate the type of product the microprocessor market requires of intel also dominates the computer system platform which includes core logic chipsets graphic chip motherboards and other component necessary to assemble computer system oems that purchase microprocessor for computer system are highly dependent on intel which can make them le innovative on their own and to large extent can become distributor of intel technology additionally intel is able to drive de facto standard and specification for microprocessor that could cause and other company to have delayed access to such standard long intel remains in this dominant position we may be materially adversely affected by intel business practice including rebating and allocation strategy and pricing action which may limit our market share and margin product mix and introduction schedule product bundling marketing and merchandising strategy exclusivity payment to it current and potential customer retailer and channel partner that require or result exclusive product arrangement de facto control over industry standard and heavy influence on pc manufacturer and other pc industry participant including motherboard memory chipset and basic input output system or bios supplier and software company well the graphic interface for intel platform and marketing and advertising expenditure in support of positioning the intel brand over the brand of it oem customer and retailer intel ha substantially greater financial resource than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amount on marketing and research and development than we do we expect intel to maintain it market position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing research and development new manufacturing facility and other technology company to the extent intel manufacture significantly larger portion of it microprocessor product using more advanced process technology or introduces competitive new product into the market we do we may be more vulnerable to intel aggressive marketing and pricing strategy for microprocessor product intel could take action that place our discrete gpus at competitive disadvantage including giving one or more of our competitor in the graphic market such nvidia corporation preferential access to it proprietary graphic interface or other useful information also intel recently announced that it is developing their own high end discrete gpus intel position in the microprocessor market and integrated graphic chipset market it introduction of competitive new product it existing relationship with top tier oems and it aggressive marketing and pricing strategy could result in lower unit sale and lower average selling price for our product which could have material adverse effect on other competitor include variety of company providing or developing arm based design at relatively low cost and low power processor for the computing market including tablet and thin client form factor well dense server set top box and gaming console arm holding design and license it arm core and architecture to third party including and offer supporting software and service our ability to compete with company who use arm based solution depends on our ability to timely design and bring to market energy efficient high performing product at an attractive price point in the chipset market our competitor include supplier of igp chipsets pc manufacturer use igp chipsets because they typically cost le than traditional discrete gpus while offering acceptable graphic performance for most mainstream pc user intel also leverage it dominance in the microprocessor market to sell it igp chipsets intel manufacture and sell igp chipsets bundled with their microprocessor and is our main competitor in this market competition in the graphic marketsin the graphic market our competitor include supplier of discrete graphic embedded graphic processor and igp chipsets intel manufacture and sell embedded graphic processor and igp chipsets and is dominant competitor with respect to this portion of our business higher unit shipment of our apus and intel integrated graphic may drive computer manufacturer to reduce the number of system they build paired with discrete graphic component particularly for notebook because they may offer satisfactory graphic performance for most mainstream pc user at lower cost intel could take action that place our discrete gpus and igp chipsets at competitive disadvantage such giving one or more of our competitor in the graphic market such nvidia corporation preferential access to it proprietary graphic interface or other useful information also intel recently announced that it is developing it own high end discrete gpus our principal competitor in the discrete graphic market is nvidia amd and nvidia are the two principal company offering discrete graphic solution other competitor include number of smaller company which may have greater flexibility to address specific market need but le financial resource to do so especially we believe that the growing complexity of graphic processor and the associated research and development cost represent an increasingly higher barrier to entry in this market in the semi custom game console product where graphic performance is critical we compete primarily against nvidia research and developmentwe focus our research and development activity on improving product performance and enhancing product design our main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of cpu and gpu ip and designing that ip into our socs for our next generation of product with in each case improved system performance and performance per watt characteristic for example we are focusing on improving the battery life of our apu product for notebook the power efficiency of our microprocessor for server and the performance and power efficiency of our discrete gpus we are also focusing on delivering range of low power integrated platform to serve key market including commercial client mobile computing gaming we believe that these platform will bring customer increased performance and energy efficiency we also work with industry leader on process technology software and other functional intellectual property and with others in the industry and industry consortium to conduct early stage research and development our research and development expense for and approximately billion billion and million respectively for more information see part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation below we conduct product and system research and development activity for our product in the united state with additional design and development engineering team located in australia china canada india singapore and taiwan manufacturing arrangement and assembly and test facilitiesthird party wafer foundry facilitiesglobalfoundries inc on march we entered into wafer supply agreement wsa with globalfoundries inc gf the wsa governs the term by which we purchase product manufactured by gf related party to pursuant to the wsa we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and apu product requirement and certain portion of our gpu product requirement from gf with limited exception for more information about the wsa see part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation globalfoundries below taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company we also have foundry arrangement with taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc for the production of wafer for certain product other third party manufacturer we outsource board level graphic product manufacturing to third party manufacturer assembly test mark and packaging facilitieswafers for our product are delivered from third party foundry to our test assembly and packaging partner located in the asia pacific region who package and test our final semiconductor product on april we and certain of our subsidiary completed the sale of majority of the equity interest in two of our assembly test mark and packaging facility suzhou tf amd semiconductor co ltd formerly amd technology china co ltd and tf amd microelectronics penang sdn bhd formerly advanced micro device export sdn bhd to affiliate of tongfu fujitsu microelectronics co ltd or tfme formerly nantong fujitsu microelectronics co ltd to form two joint venture each an atmp jv result of the sale tfme affiliate own of the equity interest in each atmp jv while certain of our subsidiary own the remaining intellectual property and licensing we rely on contract and intellectual property right to protect our product and technology from unauthorized third party copying and use intellectual property right include copyright patent patent application trademark trade secret and mask work right of december we approximately patent in the united state and approximately patent application pending in the united state in certain case we have filed corresponding application in foreign jurisdiction including united state and foreign matter we have approximately patent matter worldwide consisting of approximately issued patent and patent application pending we expect to file future patent application in both the united state and abroad on significant invention we deem appropriate we do not believe that any individual patent or the expiration of any patent is or would be material to our business is typical in the semiconductor industry we have numerous cross licensing and technology exchange agreement with other company under which we both transfer and receive technology and intellectual property right one such agreement is the cross license agreement that we entered into with intel on november under the cross license agreement we granted to intel and intel granted to non exclusive royalty free license to all of each other patent that were first filed no later than november and each party can exploit these patent anywhere in the world for making and selling certain semiconductor and electronic related product under the cross license agreement intel ha right to make semiconductor product for third party but the third party product design are not licensed result of such manufacture we have right to perform assembly and testing for third party but not right to make semiconductor product for third party the term of the cross license agreement continues the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed patent unless earlier terminated party can terminate the cross license agreement or the right and license of other party if the other party materially breach the cross license agreement and doe not correct the noticed material breach within day upon such termination the terminated party license right terminate but the terminating party license right continue subject to that party continued compliance with the term of the cross license agreement the cross license agreement will automatically terminate if party undergoes change of control defined in the cross license agreement and both party license will terminate upon the bankruptcy of party that party may assume but may not assign the cross license agreement and in the event that the cross license agreement can not be assumed the cross license agreement and the license granted will terminate backlogsales are made primarily pursuant to purchase order for current delivery or agreement covering purchase over period of time some of these order or agreement may be revised or canceled without penalty generally in light of current industry practice we do not believe that such order or agreement provide meaningful backlog figure or are necessarily indicative of actual sale for any succeeding period with respect to our semi custom soc product our order and agreement are more stringent resulting in meaningful backlog for the coming quarter seasonalityour operating result tend to vary seasonally for example historically first quarter pc product sale are generally lower than fourth quarter sale and with respect to our semi custom soc product for game console our sale pattern generally follow the seasonal trend of consumer business with sale in the first half of the year being lower than sale in the second half of the year following the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard effective in the first quarter of we expect our seasonality trend to be affected we will recognize certain revenue earlier than prior to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard for example we expect our second and third quarter sale to be higher than first and fourth quarter sale for our semi custom soc product for game console employee of december we had approximately employee environmental regulation our operation and property have in the past been and continue to be subject to various united state and foreign law and regulation including those relating to material used in our product and manufacturing process discharge of pollutant into the environment the treatment transport storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and remediation of contamination these law and regulation require our supplier to obtain permit for operation making our product including the discharge of air pollutant and wastewater although our management system are designed to oversee our supplier compliance we can not assure you that our supplier have been or will be at all time in complete compliance with such law regulation and permit if our supplier violate or fail to comply with any of them range of consequence could result including fine suspension of production alteration of manufacturing process import export restriction sale limitation criminal and civil liability or other sanction we could also be held liable for any and all consequence arising of exposure to hazardous material used stored released disposed of by or located at under or emanating from our facility or other environmental or natural resource damage while we have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditure we can not assure you that future environmental legal requirement will not become more stringent or costly in the future therefore we can not assure you that our cost of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety law and our liability arising from past and future release of or exposure to hazardous substance will not have material adverse effect on environmental law are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time for example the european union eu and china are two among growing number of jurisdiction that have enacted restriction on the use of lead and other material in electronic product these regulation affect semiconductor device and packaging regulation restricting material in electronic product continue to increase around the world there is risk that the cost quality and manufacturing yield of product that are subject to these restriction may be le favorable compared to product that are not subject to such restriction or that the transition to compliant product may not meet customer roadmaps or produce sudden change in demand which may result in excess inventory number of jurisdiction including the eu australia california and china are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulation for computer and server based on energy star specification well additional energy consumption limit there is the potential for certain of our product being excluded from some of these market which could materially adversely affect certain environmental law including the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability of or the superfund act impose strict or under certain circumstance joint and several liability on current and previous owner or operator of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substance and impose liability for damage to natural resource these law often impose liability even if the owner or operator not know of or wa not responsible for the release of such hazardous substance these environmental law also ass liability on person who arrange for hazardous substance to be sent to disposal or treatment facility when such facility are found to be contaminated such person can be responsible for cleanup cost even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility we have been named responsible party at three superfund site in sunnyvale california although we have not yet been we could be named potentially responsible party at other superfund or contaminated site in the future in addition contamination that ha not yet been identified could exist at our other facility under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of the sec adopted disclosure and reporting requirement for company that use conflict mineral originating from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining country we continue to incur additional cost associated with complying with these requirement such cost related to developing internal control for the due diligence process determining the source of any conflict mineral used in our product auditing the process and reporting to our customer and the sec in addition to the sec regulation the european union china and other jurisdiction are developing new policy focused on conflict mineral that may impact and increase the cost of our compliance program also since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenge if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origin of the subject mineral moreover we are likely to encounter challenge to satisfy those customer who require that all of the component of our product are certified conflict free if we can not satisfy these customer they may choose competitor product risk factor the risk and uncertainty described below are not the only one we face if any of the following risk actually occurs our business financial condition or result of operation could be materially adversely affected in addition you should consider the interrelationship and compounding effect of two or more risk occurring simultaneously intel corporation dominance of the microprocessor market and it aggressive business practice may limit our ability to compete effectively intel corporation ha been the market share leader for microprocessor for many year intel market share margin and significant financial resource enable it to market it product aggressively to target our customer and our channel partner with special incentive and to influence customer who do business with these aggressive activity have in the past and are likely in the future to result in lower unit sale and lower average selling price for many of our product and adversely affect our margin and profitability intel exerts substantial influence over

technology company to the extent intel manufacture significantly larger portion of it microprocessor product using more advanced process technology or introduces competitive new product into the market before we do we may be more vulnerable to intel aggressive marketing and pricing strategy for microprocessor product for example intel ha introduced microprocessor for low cost notebook similar to product that we offer for low cost notebook long intel remains in this dominant position we may be materially adversely affected by intel business practice including rebating and allocation strategy and pricing action designed to limit our market share and margin product mix and introduction schedule product bundling marketing and merchandising strategy exclusivity payment to it current and potential customer retailer and channel partner de facto control over industry standard and heavy influence on pc manufacturer and other pc industry participant including motherboard memory chipset and basic input output system or bios supplier and software company well the graphic interface for intel platform and marketing and advertising expenditure in support of positioning the intel brand over the brand of it original equipment manufacturer oem customer and retailer intel could also take action that place our discrete gpus at competitive disadvantage including giving one or more of our competitor in the graphic market such nvidia corporation preferential access to it proprietary graphic interface or other useful information also intel recently announced that it is developing their own high end discrete gpus intel position in the microprocessor market and integrated graphic chipset market it introduction of competitive new product it existing relationship with top tier oems and it aggressive marketing and pricing strategy could result in lower unit sale and lower average selling price for our product which could have material adverse effect on we have wafer supply agreement with gf with obligation to purchase all of our microprocessor and apu product requirement and certain portion of our gpu product requirement from gf with limited exception if gf is not able to satisfy our manufacturing requirement our business could be adversely impacted the wsa governs the term by which we purchase product manufactured by gf the wsa is in place until pursuant to the wsa we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and apu product requirement and portion of our gpu product requirement from gf with limited exception if gf is unable to achieve anticipated manufacturing yield remain competitive using or implementing advanced leading edge process technology needed to manufacture future generation of our product manufacture our product on timely basis at competitive price or meet our capacity requirement we may experience delay in product launch supply shortage for certain product or increased cost and our business could be materially adversely affected moreover if gf is unable to satisfy our manufacturing requirement and we are unable to secure from gf exception allowing to contract with another wafer foundry to satisfy those requirement then our business could be materially adversely affected in august we entered into the sixth amendment to the wsa with gf sixth amendment pursuant to which we agreed to certain annual wafer purchase target through and if we fail to meet the agreed wafer purchase target during calendar year we will be required to pay to gf portion of the difference between our actual wafer purchase and the applicable annual purchase target if our actual wafer requirement are le than the number of wafer required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit cost both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our result of operation in addition gf ha relied on mubadala technology investment llc mubadala tech for it funding need if mubadala tech fails to adequately fund gf on timely basis or at all gf ability to manufacture product for could be materially adversely affected we rely on third party to manufacture our product and if they are unable to do so on timely basis in sufficient quantity and using competitive technology our business could be materially adversely affected we rely on third party wafer foundry to fabricate the silicon wafer for all of our product we also rely on third party manufacturer to assemble test mark and pack atmp our product it is important to have reliable relationship with all of these third party manufacturing supplier to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand we can not guarantee that these manufacturer or our other third party manufacturing supplier will be able to meet our near term or long term manufacturing requirement if we experience supply constraint from our third party manufacturing supplier we may be required to allocate the affected product amongst our customer which could have material adverse effect on our relationship with these customer and on our financial condition in addition if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from our manufacturing supplier it could result in lost sale and have material adverse effect on our business we do not have long term commitment contract with some of our third party manufacturing supplier we obtain some of these manufacturing service on purchase order basis and these manufacturer are not required to provide with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantity in an existing purchase order accordingly we depend on these supplier to allocate to portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our need to produce product of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yield and to deliver those product to on timely basis and at acceptable price the manufacturer we use also fabricate wafer and atmp product for other company including certain of our competitor they could choose to prioritize capacity for other customer increase the price that they charge on short notice or reduce or eliminate delivery to which could have material adverse effect on our business other risk associated with our dependence on third party manufacturer include limited control over delivery schedule and quality assurance lack of capacity in period of excess demand misappropriation of our intellectual property dependence on several small undercapitalized subcontractor and limited ability to manage inventory and part moreover if any of our third party manufacturer suffer any damage to facility lose benefit under material agreement experience power outage lack sufficient capacity to manufacture our product encounter financial difficulty are unable to secure necessary raw material from their supplier or suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency we may encounter supply delay or disruption if we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supply of product our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business if we transition the production of some of our product to new manufacturer we may experience delayed product introduction lower yield or poorer performance of our product if we experience problem with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from particular third party manufacturer or if we for other reason cease utilizing one of those supplier we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in short time frame we could experience significant delay in the shipment of our product if we are required to find alternative third party manufacturer which could have material adverse effect on our business in april we consummated transaction with tongfu fujitsu microelectronics co ltd formerly nantong fujitsu microelectronics co ltd tfme under which we sold to tfme of the equity interest in our atmp facility consisting of suzhou tf amd semiconductor co ltd formerly amd technology china co ltd and tf amd microelectronics penang sdn bhd formerly advanced micro device export sdn bhd thereby forming two joint venture collectively the jv the majority of our atmp service will be provided by the jv and there is no guarantee that the jv will be able to fulfill our long term atmp requirement if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the jv it could result in lost sale and have material adverse effect on our business to achieve expected manufacturing yield for our product could negatively impact our financial result semiconductor manufacturing yield are result of both product design and process technology which is typically proprietary to the manufacturer and low yield can result from design failure process technology failure or combination of both our third party foundry including gf are responsible for the process technology used to fabricate silicon wafer if our third party foundry experience manufacturing inefficiency or encounter disruption error or difficulty during production we may fail to achieve acceptable yield or experience product delivery delay we can not be certain that our third party foundry will be able to develop obtain or successfully implement leading edge process technology needed to manufacture future generation of our product profitably or on timely basis or that our competitor will not develop new technology product or process earlier moreover during period when foundry are implementing new process technology their manufacturing facility may not be fully productive substantial delay in the technology transition to smaller process technology could have material adverse effect on particularly if our competitor transition to more cost effective technology before any decrease in manufacturing yield could result in an increase in per unit cost which would adversely impact our gross margin and or force to allocate our reduced product supply amongst our customer which could harm our relationship and reputation with our customer and materially adversely affect our business the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to introduce product on timely basis with feature and performance level that provide value to our customer while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transition our success depends to significant extent on the development qualification implementation and acceptance of new product design and improvement that provide value to our customer our ability to develop qualify and distribute and have manufactured new product and related technology to meet evolving industry requirement at price acceptable to our customer and on timely basis are significant factor in determining our competitiveness in our target market for example large portion of our computing and graphic revenue is focused on consumer desktop pc and notebook while overall growth in computing and graphic is stabilizing the area within computing and graphic are changing our ability to take advantage of the opportunity within the area of computing and graphic is based on foreseeing those change and making timely investment in the form factor that serve those area consumer adopt new form factor have new product feature preference or have different requirement than those consumer in the pc market pc sale could be negatively impacted which could adversely impact our business our product roadmap includes amd ryzen and amd epyc processor based on our new processor core codenamed zen to help drive our entry into high performance and server computing we can not assure you that our effort to execute our product roadmap and address market beyond our core pc market will result in innovative product and technology that provide value to our customer if we fail to or are delayed in developing qualifying or shipping new product or technology that provide value to our customer and address these new trend or if we fail to predict which new form factor consumer will adopt and adjust our business accordingly we may lose competitive positioning which could cause to lose market share and require to discount the selling price of our product although we make substantial investment in research and development we can not be certain that we will be able to develop obtain or successfully implement new product and technology on timely basis or that they will be well received by our customer moreover our investment in new product and technology involve certain risk and uncertainty and could disrupt our ongoing business new investment may not generate sufficient revenue may incur unanticipated liability and may divert our limited resource and distract management from our current operation we can not be certain that our ongoing investment in new product and technology will be successful will meet our expectation and will not adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating result delay in developing qualifying or shipping new product can also cause to miss our customer product design window or in some case breach contractual obligation or cause to pay penalty if our customer do not include our product in the initial design of their computer system or product they will typically not use our product in their system or product until at least the next design configuration the process of being qualified for inclusion in customer system or product can be lengthy and could cause to miss cycle in the demand of end user which also could result in loss of market share and harm our business in addition market demand requires that product incorporate new feature and performance standard on an industry wide basis over the life of specific product the sale price is typically reduced over time the introduction of new product and enhancement to existing product is necessary to maintain the overall corporate average selling price if we are unable to introduce new product with sufficiently high sale price or to increase unit sale volume capable of offsetting the reduction in the sale price of existing product over time our business could be materially adversely affected if we can not generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow or obtain external financing we may face cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investment in research and development or other strategic investment our ability to fund research and development expenditure depends on generating sufficient revenue and cash flow from operation and the availability of external financing if necessary our research and development expenditure together with ongoing operating expense will be substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balance if new competitor technological advance by existing competitor or other competitive factor require to invest significantly greater resource anticipated in our research and development effort our operating expense would increase if we are required to invest significantly greater resource than anticipated in research and development effort without an increase in revenue our operating result could decline we regularly ass market for external financing opportunity including debt and equity financing additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or if available may not be available on satisfactory term the health of the credit market may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing when needed any downgrade from credit rating agency such moody or standard poor may adversely impact our ability to obtain external financing or the term of such financing credit agency downgrade or concern regarding our credit worthiness may impact relationship with our supplier who may limit our credit line our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operation may require to abandon project or curtail planned investment in research and development or other strategic initiative if we curtail planned investment in research and development or abandon project our product may fail to remain competitive and our business would be materially adversely affected the loss of significant customer may have material adverse effect on collectively sony interactive entertainment llc microsoft corporation and hp inc accounted for approximately of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended december sale to sony and microsoft consisted of product from our enterprise embedded and semi custom segment and sale to hp consisted primarily of product from our computing and graphic segment we expect that small number of customer will continue to account for substantial part of revenue of our business in the future if one of our key customer decides to stop buying our product or if one of these customer materially reduces or reorganizes it operation or it demand for our product our business would be materially adversely affected our receipt of revenue from our semi custom soc product is dependent upon our technology being designed into third party product and the success of those product the revenue that we receive from our semi custom soc product is in the form of non recurring engineering fee charged to third party for design and development service and revenue received in connection with sale of our semi custom soc product to these third party result our ability to generate revenue from our semi custom product depends on our ability to secure customer for our semi custom design pipeline our customer desire to pursue the project and our semi custom soc product being incorporated into those customer product any revenue from sale of our semi custom soc product is directly related to sale of the third party product and reflective of their success in the market moreover we have no control over the marketing effort of these third party and we can not make any assurance that sale of their product will be successful in current or future year consequently the semi custom soc product revenue expected by may not be fully realized and our operating result may be adversely affected our product may be subject to security vulnerability that could have material adverse effect on the product that we sell are complex and may be subject to security vulnerability that could result in among other thing the loss corruption theft or misuse of confidential data or system performance issue our effort to prevent and address security vulnerability may decrease performance be only partially effective or not successful at all we may also depend on third party such customer vendor and end user to deploy our mitigation or create their own and they may delay decline or modify the implementation of such mitigation our relationship with our customer could be adversely affected some of our customer may stop purchasing our product reduce or delay future purchase of our product or use competing product any of these action by our customer could adversely affect our revenue we also are subject to claim and litigation related to the recently disclosed side channel exploit such spectre and may face additional claim or litigation for future vulnerability actual or perceived security vulnerability of our product may subject to adverse publicity damage to our brand and reputation and could materially harm our business or financial result global economic uncertainty may adversely impact our business and operating result uncertain global economic condition have in the past and may in the future adversely impact our business including without limitation slowdown in the chinese economy one of the largest global market for desktop and notebook pc uncertainty in the worldwide economic environment may negatively impact consumer confidence and spending causing our customer to postpone purchase in addition during challenging economic time our current or potential future customer may experience cash flow problem and result may modify delay or cancel plan to purchase our product additionally if our customer are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are unable to secure financing they may not be able to pay or may delay payment of account receivable that they owe the risk related to our customer potentially defaulting on or delaying payment to is increased because we expect that small number of customer will continue to account for substantial part of our revenue any inability of our current or potential future customer to pay for our product may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow moreover our key supplier may reduce their output or become insolvent thereby adversely impacting ability to manufacture our product in addition uncertain economic condition may make it more difficult for to raise fund through borrowing or private or public sale of debt or equity security we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligation or meet our working capital requirement our ability to make payment on and to refinance our debt will depend on our financial and operating performance which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and is subject to prevailing economic condition and financial business and other factor many of which are beyond our control we can not assure you that we will be able to generate cash flow or that we will be able to borrow fund including under our secured revolving line of credit for principal amount up to million our secured revolving line of credit in amount sufficient to enable to service our debt or to meet our working capital requirement if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operation or to borrow sufficient fund to service our debt we may be required to sell asset or equity reduce expenditure refinance all or portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing we can not assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt sell asset or equity borrow fund under our secured revolving line of credit or borrow more fund on term acceptable to if at all we have large amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligation our total debt of december wa billion net of unamortized debt issuance cost and unamortized debt discount associated with the note our large indebtedness may make it difficult for to satisfy our financial obligation including making scheduled principal and interest payment limit our ability to borrow additional fund for working capital capital expenditure acquisition and general corporate and other purpose limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital capital expenditure acquisition or other general corporate purpose require to use substantial portion of our cash flow from operation to make debt service payment place at competitive disadvantage compared to our competitor with relatively le debt and increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry condition we enter into sale and factoring arrangement from time to time with respect to certain of our account receivables which arrangement are non recourse to in the event that an account debtor fails to pay for credit related reason and are not included in our indebtedness we could become obligated to repurchase such account receivables or otherwise incur liability to the counterparties under these arrangement under certain circumstance such where commercial dispute arises between and an account debtor the agreement governing our note and our secured revolving line of credit impose restriction on that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business the indenture governing our senior note due note senior note due note and senior note due note contain various covenant which limit our ability to among other thing incur additional indebtedness pay dividend and make other restricted payment make certain investment including investment in our unrestricted subsidiary create or permit certain lien create or permit restriction on the ability of certain restricted subsidiary to pay dividend or make other distribution to use the proceeds from sale of asset enter into certain type of transaction with affiliate and consolidate or merge or sell our asset an entirety or substantially an entirety in addition the amended and restated loan agreement restricts our ability to make cash payment on the note to the extent that on the date of such payment default or event of default exists under the amended and restated loan agreement or we have not had at all time during the consecutive day immediately preceding such payment or would not have on pro forma basis after giving effect to such payment excess cash availability defined in the amended and restated loan agreement of at least million any of our future debt agreement may contain similar restriction if we fail to make any cash payment on series of note when required by the applicable indenture it would constitute an event of default under such indenture which in turn would constitute an event of default under the agreement governing our other indebtedness secured revolving line of credit also contains various covenant which limit our ability to among other thing make certain investment merge or consolidate with other entity and permit certain subsidiary from incurring indebtedness in addition further restriction apply when certain payment condition the payment condition are not satisfied with respect to specified transaction event or payment the payment condition include that no default or event

length transaction with an affiliate except for certain customary exception the agreement governing our note and our secured revolving line of credit contain cross default provision whereby default under one agreement would likely result in cross default under agreement covering other borrowing for example the occurrence of default with respect to any indebtedness or any failure to repay debt when due in an amount in excess of million would cause cross default under the indenture to the extent such default would result in the acceleration of such indebtedness governing our note note note and note well under our secured revolving line of credit the occurrence of default under any of these borrowing arrangement would permit the applicable note holder or the lender under our secured revolving line of credit to declare all amount outstanding under those borrowing arrangement to be immediately due and payable if the note holder or the trustee under the indenture governing our note note note or note or the lender under our secured revolving line of credit accelerate the repayment of borrowing we can not assure you that we will have sufficient asset to repay those borrowing the market in which our product are sold are highly competitive the market in which our product are sold are competitive and delivering the latest and best product to market on timely basis is critical to achieving revenue growth we believe that the main factor that determine our product competitiveness are timely product introduction product quality product feature and capability including enabling state of the art visual and virtual reality experience energy efficiency including power consumption and battery life reliability processor clock speed performance size or form factor selling price cost adherence to industry standard and the creation of open industry standard level of integration software and hardware compatibility security and stability brand recognition and availability we expect that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological change frequent product introduction by our competitor or new competitor of product that may provide better performance experience or may include additional feature that render our product uncompetitive we may also face aggressive pricing by competitor especially during challenging economic time some competitor may have greater access or right to complementary technology including interface processor and memory technical information for instance with the introduction of our apu product and other competing solution with integrated graphic we believe that demand for additional discrete graphic chip and card may decrease in the future due to improvement in the quality and performance of integrated graphic in addition our competitor have significant marketing and sale resource which could increase the competitive environment in such declining market leading to lower price and margin if competitor introduce competitive new product into the market before demand for our product could be adversely impacted and our business could be adversely affected in addition we are entering market with current and new competitor who may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirement and emerging technology we can not assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitor who may have stronger position in these new market or superior ability to anticipate customer requirement and emerging industry trend we may face delay or disruption in research and development effort or we may be required to invest significantly greater resource in research and development than anticipated issuance to west coast hitech wch of warrant to purchase million share of our common stock if and when exercised will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholder and the conversion of the note may dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholder or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock in consideration for the limited waiver and right under the sixth amendment we issued warrant to wch to purchase million share of our common stock any issuance by of share of our common stock to wch upon exercise of the warrant will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholder any sale in the public market by wch of any share owned by wch could adversely affect prevailing market price of our common stock and the anticipated exercise by wch of the warrant could depress the price of our common stock also the conversion of some or all of the note may dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholder all of the note were convertible at the option of their holder prior to their scheduled term from october until december any sale in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market price of our common stock in addition the existence of the note may encourage short selling by market participant because the conversion thereof could be used to satisfy short position or the anticipated conversion of the note into cash and or share of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock uncertainty involving the ordering and shipment of our product could materially adversely affect we typically sell our product pursuant to individual purchase order we generally do not have long term supply arrangement with our customer or minimum purchase requirement except that order generally must be for standard pack quantity generally our customer may cancel order for standard product more than day prior to shipment without incurring significant fee we base our inventory level in part on customer estimate of demand for their product which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our product that our customer will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our product are sold indirectly through downstream channel distributor and customer our forecast for demand are then based on estimate provided by multiple party throughout the downstream channel pc and consumer market are characterized by short product lifecycles which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion in addition our customer may change their inventory practice on short notice for any reason we may build inventory during period of anticipated growth and the cancellation or deferral of product order or overproduction due to failure of anticipated order to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory which could result in write down of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margin factor that may result in excess or obsolete inventory which could result in write down of the value of our inventory reduction in the average selling price or reduction in our gross margin include sudden or significant decrease in demand for our product production or design defect in our product higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirement failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our product including for our older product our new product are introduced or our competitor introducing new product or taking aggressive pricing action the demand for our product depends in part on the market condition in the industry into which they are sold fluctuation in demand for our product or market decline in any of these industry could have material adverse effect on our result of operation industry wide fluctuation in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected in the past and may materially adversely affect in the future large portion of our computing and graphic revenue is focused on the consumer desktop pc and notebook segment which have experienced and continue to experience decline driven by among other factor the adoption of smaller and other form factor increased competition and change in replacement cycle the success of our semi custom soc product is dependent on securing customer for our semi custom design pipeline and consumer market condition including the success of the sony playstation sony playstation pro microsoft xbox one microsoft xbox one and microsoft xbox one game console system worldwide in addition the gpu market ha seen elevated demand due to the application of gpu product to cryptocurrency mining for example our gpu revenue ha been driven in part due to an increased interest in cryptocurrency mining the cryptocurrency market is unstable and demand could change quickly for example china and south korea have recently instituted restriction on cryptocurrency trading if we are unable to manage the risk related to decrease in the demand for cryptocurrency mining our gpu business could be materially adversely affected ability to design and introduce new product in timely manner is dependent upon third party intellectual property in the design and development of new and enhanced product we rely on third party intellectual property such software development tool and hardware testing tool furthermore certain product feature may rely on intellectual property acquired from third party the design requirement necessary to meet customer demand for more feature and greater functionality from semiconductor product may exceed the capability of the third party intellectual property or development tool available to if the third party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable is not available with required functionality and performance in the time frame or price point needed for our new product or fails to produce design that meet customer demand our business could be materially adversely affected we depend on third party company for the design manufacture and supply of motherboards software and other computer platform component to support our business we depend on third party company for the design manufacture and supply of motherboards graphic card software bios operating system driver and other component that our customer utilize to support and or use our microprocessor gpu and apu offering we also rely on aibs to support our gpu and apu product in addition our microprocessor are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with intel microprocessor if the designer manufacturer aibs and supplier of motherboards graphic card software and other component decrease their support for our product offering our business could be materially adversely affected if we lose microsoft corporation support for our product or other software vendor do not design and develop software to run on our product our ability to sell our product could be materially adversely affected our ability to innovate beyond the instruction set controlled by intel depends partially on microsoft designing and developing it operating system to run on or support our based microprocessor product with respect to our graphic product we depend in part on microsoft to design and develop it operating system to run on or support our graphic product similarly the success of our product in the market such our apu product is dependent on independent software provider designing and developing software to run on our product if microsoft doe not continue to design and develop it operating system so that they work with our instruction set or doe not continue to develop and maintain their operating system to support our graphic product independent software provider may forego designing their software application to take advantage of our innovation and customer may not purchase pc with our product in addition some software driver licensed for use with our product are certified by microsoft if microsoft did not certify driver or if we otherwise fail to retain the support of microsoft or other software vendor our ability to market our product would be materially adversely affected our reliance on third party distributor and aib partner subject to certain risk we market and sell our product directly and through third party distributor and aib partner pursuant to agreement that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party these agreement are non exclusive and permit both our distributor and aibs to offer our competitor product we are dependent on our distributor and aibs to supplement our direct marketing and sale effort if any significant distributor or aib or substantial number of our distributor or aibs terminated their relationship with decided to market our competitor product over our product or decided not to market our product at all our ability to bring our product to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage the risk related to the use of our third party distributor and aib partner or offer appropriate incentive to focus them on the sale of our product our business could be materially adversely affected additionally distributor and aibs typically maintain an inventory of our product in most instance our agreement with distributor protect their inventory of our product against price reduction well provide return right for any product that we have removed from our price book and that is not more than month older than the manufacturing code date some agreement with our distributor also contain standard stock rotation provision permitting limited level of product return our agreement with aibs protect their inventory of our product against price reduction in the event of significant decline in the price of our product the price protection right we offer would materially adversely affect because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our business much of our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous qualified engineering marketing sale and executive personnel competition for highly skilled employee and executive in the technology industry is intense if we are not able to continue to attract train and retain qualified personnel necessary for our business the progress of our product development program could be hindered and we could be materially adversely affected to help attract retain and motivate qualified personnel we use share based incentive award such employee stock option and non vested share unit restricted stock unit if the value of such stock award doe not appreciate measured by the performance of the price of our common or if our share based compensation otherwise cease to be viewed valuable benefit our ability to attract retain and motivate personnel could be weakened which could harm our result of operation also if the value of our stock award increase substantially this could potentially create great personal wealth for our employee and affect our ability to retain these employee in addition our current and any future restructuring plan may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key employee in the event of change of control we may not be able to repurchase our outstanding debt required by the applicable indenture and our secured revolving line of credit which would result in default under the indenture and our secured revolving line of credit upon change of control we will be required to offer to repurchase all of our note note note and note then outstanding at of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest if any up to but excluding the repurchase date in addition change of control would be an event of default under our secured revolving line of credit of december million borrowing were outstanding under the secured revolving line of credit million related to letter of credit under the secured revolving line of credit remained outstanding and billion principal amount wa outstanding under our note future debt agreement may contain similar provision we may not have the financial resource to repurchase our outstanding note and prepay all of our outstanding obligation under our secured revolving line of credit the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and ha experienced severe downturn that have materially adversely affected and may continue to materially adversely affect our business in the future the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and ha experienced significant downturn often in conjunction with constant and rapid technological change wide fluctuation in supply and demand continuous new product introduction price erosion and decline in general economic condition we have incurred substantial loss in recent downturn due to substantial decline in average selling price the cyclical nature of supply and demand imbalance in the semiconductor industry decline in demand for end user product such pc that incorporate our product and excess inventory level industry wide fluctuation in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected in the past and may materially adversely affect in the future for example large portion of our computing and graphic revenue is focused on consumer desktop pc and notebook segment while the overall growth in these segment is stabilizing the sub segment of these market are changing our ability to take advantage of the growth in these sub segment is based on foreseeing those change and making timely investment in the form factor that serve those growing sub segment global economic uncertainty and weakness have in the past impacted the semiconductor market consumer and business have deferred purchase which negatively impacted demand for our product our financial performance ha been and may in the future be negatively affected by these downturn the growth of our business is also dependent on continued demand for our product from high growth adjacent emerging global market our ability to be successful in such market depends in part on our ability to establish adequate local infrastructure well our ability to cultivate and maintain local relationship in these market if demand from these market is below our expectation sale of our product may decrease which would have material adverse effect on acquisition divestiture and or joint venture could disrupt our business harm our financial condition and operating result or dilute or adversely affect the price of our common stock our success will depend in part on our ability to expand our product offering and grow our business in response to changing technology customer demand and competitive pressure in some circumstance we may pursue growth through the acquisition of complementary business solution or technology or through divestiture or joint venture rather than through internal development the identification of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidate can be difficult time consuming and costly and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisition or joint venture moreover if such acquisition or joint venture require to seek additional debt or equity financing we may not be able to obtain such financing on term favorable to or at all even if we successfully complete an acquisition or joint venture we may not be able to assimilate and integrate effectively or efficiently the acquired business technology solution asset personnel or operation particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for acquisition and joint venture may also involve the entry into geographic or business market in which we have little or no prior experience consequently we may not achieve anticipated benefit of the acquisition or joint venture which could harm our operating result in addition to complete an acquisition we may issue equity security which would dilute our stockholder ownership and could adversely affect the price of our common stock well incur debt assume contingent liability or have amortization expense and write down of acquired asset could adversely affect our result of operation acquisition and joint venture may also reduce our cash available for operation and other us which could harm our business also any failure on our part to effectively evaluate and execute new business initiative could adversely affect our business we may not adequately ass the risk of new business initiative and subsequent event may arise that alter the risk that were initially considered furthermore we may not achieve the objective and expectation with respect to future operation product and service in we consummated the transaction with tfme under which we sold to tfme of the equity interest in our jv going forward we expect the majority of our atmp service will be provided by the jv and there is no guarantee that the jv will be able to fulfill our long term atmp requirement if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the jv it could result in lost sale and have material adverse effect on our business in addition we may not realize the anticipated benefit from any new business initiative for example in connection with our strategy of licensing portion of our intellectual property portfolio in we entered into joint venture with tianjin haiguang advanced technology investment co ltd thatic comprised of two separate legal entity china and china collectively the thatic jv the primary purpose of the thatic jv is to support our expansion into the server and workstation product market in china we also licensed certain of our intellectual property licensed ip to the thatic jv for license fee payable over several year contingent upon achievement of certain milestone we also expect to receive royalty based on the sale of the thatic jv product to be developed on the basis of such licensed ip we may not realize the expected benefit from this joint venture including the thatic jv expected future performance the receipt of any future milestone payment from the licensed ip and the receipt of any royalty payment from future sale of product by the thatic jv our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business process and information system and modification or interruption of such system may disrupt our business process and internal control we rely upon number of internal business process and information system to support key business function and the efficient operation of these process and system is critical to our business our business process and information system need to be sufficiently scalable to support the growth of our business and may require modification or upgrade that expose to number of operational risk such our information system will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business need these change may be costly and disruptive to our operation and could impose substantial demand on management time these change may also require change in our information system modification of internal control procedure and significant training of employee and third party resource we continuously work on simplifying our information system and application through consolidation and standardization effort there can be no assurance that our business and operation will not experience any disruption in connection with this transition our information technology system and those of third party information technology provider or business partner may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstance beyond our control including catastrophic event power anomaly or outage natural disaster virus or malware cyber attack data breach and computer system or network failure exposing to significant cost reputational harm and disruption or damage to our business in addition our it environment continues to evolve we are embracing new way of communicating and sharing data internally and externally with customer and partner using method such mobility and the cloud that can promote business efficiency however these practice can also result in more distributed it environment making it more difficult for to maintain visibility and control over internal and external user and meet scalability and administrative requirement if our security control can not keep pace with the speed of these change or if we are not able to meet regulatory and compliance requirement our business would be materially adversely affected data breach and cyber attack could compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information be costly to remediate and cause significant damage to our business and reputation in the ordinary course of our business we maintain sensitive data on our network and also may maintain sensitive information on our business partner and third party provider network including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business and that of our customer and business partner the secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business and reputation we believe that company have been increasingly subject to wide variety of security incident cyber attack hacking and phishing attack and other attempt to gain unauthorized access these threat can come from variety of source all ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker to state sponsored attack cyber threat may be generic or they may be custom crafted against our information system cyber attack have become increasingly more prevalent and much harder to detect and defend against our network and storage application well those of our customer business partner and third party provider may be subject to unauthorized access by hacker or breached due to operator error malfeasance or other system disruption it is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incident and the damage caused by such incident these data breach and any unauthorized access misuse or disclosure of our information or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information cyber attack on or our customer business partner or third party provider could also cause to incur significant remediation cost result in product development delay disrupt key business operation and divert attention of management and key information technology resource these incident could also subject to liability expose to significant expense and cause significant harm to our reputation and business in addition we are currently subject to claim and could be subject to to additional claim in the future for damage resulting from loss of data from alleged vulnerability in the security of our processor we also maintain confidential and personally identifiable information about our worker the integrity and protection of our worker data is critical to our business and our worker have high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information we anticipate an increase in cost related to implementing new data security procedure including cost related to upgrading computer and network security training worker to maintain and monitor our security measure remediating any data security breach and addressing the related litigation and mitigating reputational harm we often partner with third party provider for certain worker service and we may provide certain limited worker information to such third party based on the scope of the service provided to however if these third party fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practice or in the event of breach of their network our worker data may be improperly accessed used or disclosed breach of data privacy is likely to cause significant disruption of our business operation failure to adequately maintain and update our security system could materially adversely affect our operation and our ability to maintain worker confidence failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information and data breach could materially adversely affect our financial condition our competitive position and operating result our operating result are subject to quarterly and seasonal sale pattern large portion of our quarterly sale have historically been made in the last month of the quarter this uneven sale pattern make prediction of revenue for each financial period difficult and increase the risk of unanticipated variation in quarterly result and financial condition in addition our operating result tend to vary seasonally with the market in which our product are sold for example historically first quarter pc product sale are generally lower than fourth quarter sale and with respect to our semi custom soc product for game console our sale pattern generally follow the seasonal trend of consumer business with sale in the first half of the year being lower than sale in the second half of the year following the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard asc effective in the first quarter of we expect our seasonality trend to be affected we will recognize certain revenue earlier than prior to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard for example we expect our second and third quarter sale to be higher than first and fourth quarter sale for our semi custom soc product for game console many of the factor that create and affect quarterly and seasonal trend are beyond our control if essential equipment material or manufacturing process are not available to manufacture our product we could be materially adversely affected we may purchase equipment and material for our back end manufacturing operation from number of supplier and our operation depend upon obtaining delivery of adequate supply of equipment and material on timely basis our third party supplier also depend on the same timely delivery of adequate quantity of equipment and material in the manufacture of our product in addition many of our product increase in technical complexity we rely on our third party supplier to update their process in order to continue meeting our back end manufacturing need certain equipment and material that are used in the manufacture of our product are available only from limited number of supplier or in some case sole supplier we also depend on limited number of supplier to provide the majority of certain type of integrated circuit package for our microprocessor including our apu product similarly certain non proprietary material or component such memory printed circuit board pcbs interposers substrate and capacitor used in the manufacture of our product are currently available from only limited number of source because some of the equipment and material that we and our third party manufacturing supplier purchase are complex it is sometimes difficult to substitute one supplier for another from time to time supplier may extend lead time limit supply or increase price due to capacity constraint or other factor also some of these material and component may be subject to rapid change in price and availability interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortage and price increase in various essential material dependence on sole supplier or limited number of supplier exacerbates these risk if we are unable to procure certain of these material for our back end manufacturing operation or our third party foundry or manufacturing supplier are unable to procure material for manufacturing our product our business would be materially adversely affected our product are not compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware we could be materially adversely affected our product may not be fully compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware further we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problem in timely manner if our customer are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware we could be materially adversely affected in addition the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our product could have material adverse effect on our business cost related to defective product could have material adverse effect on product complex those we offer may contain defect or failure when first introduced or when new version or enhancement to existing product are released we can not assure you that despite our testing procedure error will not be found in new product or release after commencement of commercial shipment in the future which could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our product material recall and replacement cost loss of revenue writing the inventory of defective product the diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from product development effort defending against litigation related to defective product or related liability including property damage personal injury damage to our reputation in the industry and loss of data or intangible property and could adversely affect our relationship with our customer in addition we may have difficulty identifying the end customer of the defective product in the field result we could incur substantial cost to implement modification to correct defect any of these problem could materially adversely affect our business we could be subject to potential product liability claim if one of our product cause or merely appears to have caused an injury whether tangible or intangible claim may be made by consumer or others selling our product and we may be subject to claim against even if an alleged injury is due to the action of others product liability claim recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liability or for amount in excess of insured liability could have material adverse effect on our business if we fail to maintain the efficiency of our supply chain we respond to change in customer demand for our product our business could be materially adversely affected our ability to meet customer demand for our product depends in part on our ability to deliver the product our customer want on timely basis accordingly we rely on our supply chain for the manufacturing distribution and fulfillment of our product we continue to grow our business expand to high growth adjacent market acquire new customer and strengthen relationship with existing customer the efficiency of our supply chain will become increasingly important because many of our customer tend to have specific requirement for particular product and specific time frame in which they require delivery of these product if we are unable to consistently deliver the right product to our customer on timely basis in the right location our customer may reduce the quantity they order from which could have material adverse effect on our business we outsource to third party certain supply chain logistics function including portion of our product distribution transportation management and information technology support service we rely on third party provider to operate our regional product distribution center and to manage the transportation of our work in process and finished product among our facility to our manufacturing supplier and to our customer in addition we rely on third party to provide certain information technology service to including help desk support desktop application service business and software support application server and storage administration datacenter operation database administration and voice video and remote access we can not guarantee that these provider will fulfill their respective responsibility in timely manner in accordance with the contract term in which case our internal operation and the distribution of our product to our customer could be materially adversely affected also we can not guarantee that our contract with these third party provider will be renewed in which case we would have to transition these function in house or secure new provider which could have material adverse effect on our business if the transition is not executed appropriately we may incur future impairment of goodwill we perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis we monitor for any event or change in circumstance such significant adverse change in business climate or operating result change in management business strategy an inability to successfully introduce new product in the marketplace an inability to successfully achieve internal forecast or significant decline in our stock price which may represent an indicator of impairment the occurrence of any of these event may require to record future goodwill impairment charge stock price is subject to volatility our stock price ha experienced price and volume fluctuation and could be subject to wide fluctuation in the future the trading price of our stock may fluctuate widely due to various factor including actual or anticipated fluctuation in our financial condition and operating result change in financial estimate by or security analyst change in our capital structure including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public interest rate change news regarding our product or product of our competitor and broad market and industry fluctuation stock price fluctuation could impact the value of our equity compensation which could affect our ability to recruit and retain employee in addition volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunity our worldwide operation are subject to political legal and economic risk and natural disaster which could have material adverse effect on we maintain operation around the world including in the united state canada europe australia and asia we rely on third party wafer foundry in europe and asia nearly all product assembly and final testing of our product is performed at manufacturing facility operated by third party manufacturing facility in china malaysia and taiwan we also have international sale operation international sale percent of net revenue were in we expect that international sale will continue to be significant portion of total sale in the foreseeable future the political legal and economic risk associated with our operation in foreign country include without limitation expropriation change in specific country or region political or economic condition change in tax law trade protection measure and import or export licensing requirement difficulty in protecting our intellectual property difficulty in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practice and labor law change in foreign currency exchange rate restriction on transfer of fund and other asset of our subsidiary between jurisdiction change in freight and interest rate disruption in air transportation between the united state and our overseas facility loss or modification of exemption for tax and tariff and compliance with law and regulation related to international operation including export control and economic sanction law and regulation and the foreign corrupt practice act in addition our worldwide operation or those of our business partner could be subject to natural disaster such earthquake tsunami flooding typhoon and volcanic eruption that disrupt manufacturing or other operation for example our sunnyvale operation are located near major earthquake fault line in california any conflict or uncertainty in the country in which we operate including public health issue for example an outbreak of contagious disease such avian influenza measles or ebola safety issue natural disaster fire disruption of service from utility nuclear power plant accident or general economic or political factor for example the united kingdom referendum commonly referred to brexit ha created economic and political uncertainty in the european union also the new administration ha called for change to domestic and foreign policy we can not predict the impact if any of the policy adopted by the new administration will have on our business until we know change are enacted we will not know whether in total we benefit from or are negatively affected by the change any of the risk should they occur could result in an increase in the cost of component production delay general business interruption delay from difficulty in obtaining export license for certain technology tariff and other barrier and restriction longer payment cycle increased tax restriction on the repatriation of fund and the burden of complying with variety of foreign law any of which could ultimately have material adverse effect on our business worldwide political condition may adversely affect demand for our product worldwide political condition may create uncertainty that could adversely affect our business the united state ha been and may continue to be involved in armed conflict that could have further impact on our sale and our supply chain the consequence of armed conflict political instability or civil or military unrest are unpredictable and we may not be able to foresee event that could have material adverse effect on terrorist attack or other hostile act may negatively affect our operation or adversely affect demand for our product and such attack or related armed conflict may impact our physical facility or those of our supplier or customer furthermore these attack or hostile act may make travel and the transportation of our product more difficult and more expensive which could materially adversely affect any of these event could cause consumer spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the united state economy and worldwide financial market currency exchange rate fluctuation could adversely affect we have cost asset and liability that are denominated in foreign currency consequence movement in exchange rate could cause our foreign currency denominated expense to increase percentage of revenue affecting our profitability and cash flow whenever we believe appropriate we hedge portion of our short term foreign currency exposure to protect against fluctuation in currency exchange rate we determine our total foreign currency exposure using projection of long term expenditure for item such payroll we can not assure you that these activity will be effective in reducing foreign exchange rate exposure failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition result of operation and cash flow in addition the majority of our product sale are denominated in dollar fluctuation in the exchange rate between the dollar and the local currency can cause increase or decrease in the cost of our product in the local currency of such customer an appreciation of the dollar relative to the local currency could reduce sale of our product our inability to effectively control the sale of our product on the gray market could have material adverse effect on we market and sell our product directly to oems and through authorized third party distributor from time to time our product are diverted from our authorized distribution channel and are sold on the gray market gray market product result in shadow inventory that is not visible to thus making it difficult to forecast demand accurately also when gray market product enter the market we and our distribution channel compete with these heavily discounted gray market product which adversely affect demand for our product and negatively impact our margin in addition our inability to control gray market activity could result in customer satisfaction issue because any time product are purchased outside our authorized distribution channel there is risk that our customer are buying counterfeit or substandard product including product that may have been altered mishandled or damaged or are used product represented new if we can not adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the united state and abroad through patent copyright trade secret trademark and other measure we may lose competitive advantage and incur significant expense we rely on combination of protection provided by contract including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreement copyright patent trademark and common law right such trade secret to protect our intellectual property however we can not assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property from third party infringement or from misappropriation in the united state and abroad any patent licensed by or issued to could be challenged invalidated or circumvented or right granted there under may not provide competitive advantage to furthermore patent application that we file may not result in issuance of patent or if patent is issued the patent may not be issued in form that is advantageous to despite our effort to protect our intellectual property right others may independently develop similar product duplicate our product or design around our patent and other right in addition it is difficult to monitor compliance with and enforce our intellectual property on worldwide basis in cost effective manner in jurisdiction where foreign law provide le intellectual property protection than afforded in the united state and abroad our technology or other intellectual property may be compromised and our business would be materially adversely affected we are party to litigation and may become party to other claim or litigation that could cause to incur substantial cost or pay substantial damage or prohibit from selling our product from time to time we are defendant or plaintiff in various legal action for example described in note of our consolidated financial statement we have been subject to certain claim concerning federal security law and corporate governance our product are purchased by and or used by consumer which could increase our exposure to consumer action such product liability claim and consumer class action claim including those described in note of our consolidated financial statement on occasion we receive claim that individual were allegedly exposed to substance used in our former semiconductor wafer manufacturing facility and that this alleged exposure caused harm litigation can involve complex factual and legal question and it outcome is uncertain it is possible that if claim is successfully asserted against including the claim described in note of our consolidated financial statement it could result in the payment of damage that could be material to our business with respect to intellectual property litigation from time to time we have been notified of or third party may bring or have brought action against and or against our customer based on allegation that we are infringing the intellectual property right of others contributing to or inducing the infringement of the intellectual property right of others improperly claiming ownership of intellectual property or otherwise improperly using the intellectual property of others if any such claim are asserted we may seek to obtain license under the third party intellectual property right we can not assure you that we will be able to obtain all of the necessary license on satisfactory term if at all these party may file lawsuit against or our customer seeking damage potentially up to and including treble damage or an injunction against the sale of product that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our business presently conducted which could result in our having to stop the sale of some of our product or to increase the cost of selling some of our product or which could damage reputation the award

we could decide in the alternative to redesign our product or to resort to litigation to challenge such claim such challenge could be extremely expensive and time consuming regardless of their merit could cause delay in product release or shipment and or could have material adverse effect on we can not assure you that litigation related to our intellectual property right or the intellectual property right of others can always be avoided or successfully concluded even if we were to prevail any litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operation which could have material adverse effect on our business is subject to potential tax liability we are subject to income tax in the united state canada and other foreign jurisdiction significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income tax tax law are dynamic and subject to change new law are passed and new interpretation of the law are issued or applied the recently enacted significant tax reform and certain provision of the new law may adversely affect the tax cut and job act of tax reform act ha resulted in significant change to the corporate income tax system these change include federal statutory rate reduction from to the elimination or reduction of certain domestic deduction and credit and limitation on the deductibility of interest expense the tax reform act also transition international taxation from worldwide system to modified territorial system and includes base erosion prevention measure on non earnings which ha the effect of subjecting certain earnings of our foreign subsidiary to taxation these change are effective beginning in we recorded preliminary estimate of the impact of the tax reform act in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no sab these estimate are subject to further analysis and review which may result in material adjustment in in the ordinary course of our business there are many transaction and calculation where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain including uncertainty due to the tax reform act although we believe our tax estimate are reasonable we can not assure you that the final determination of any tax audit and litigation will not be materially different from that which is reflected in historical income tax provision and accrual should additional tax be assessed result of an audit assessment or litigation there could be material adverse effect on our cash income tax provision and net income in the period or period for which that determination is made we are subject to environmental law conflict mineral related provision of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act well variety of other law or regulation that could result in additional cost and liability our operation and property have in the past been and continue to be subject to various united state and foreign law and regulation including those relating to material used in our product and manufacturing process discharge of pollutant into the environment the treatment transport storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and remediation of contamination these law and regulation require our supplier to obtain permit for operation making our product including the discharge of air pollutant and wastewater although our management system are designed to oversee our supplier compliance we can not assure you that our supplier have been or will be at all time in complete compliance with such law regulation and permit if our supplier violate or fail to comply with any of them range of consequence could result including fine suspension of production alteration of manufacturing process import export restriction sale limitation criminal and civil liability or other sanction such non compliance from our manufacturing supplier could result in disruption in supply higher sourcing cost and or reputational damage for environmental law are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time for example the european union eu and china are two among growing number of jurisdiction that have enacted restriction on the use of lead and other material in electronic product these regulation affect semiconductor device and packaging regulation restricting material in electronic product continue to increase around the world there is risk that the cost quality and manufacturing yield of product that are subject to these restriction may be le favorable compared to product that are not subject to such restriction or that the transition to compliant product may not meet customer roadmaps or produce sudden change in demand which may result in excess inventory number of jurisdiction including the eu australia california and china are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulation for computer and server based on energy star specification well additional energy consumption limit there is the potential for certain of our product being excluded from some of these market which could materially adversely affect certain environmental law including the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of or the superfund act impose strict or under certain circumstance joint and several liability on current and previous owner or operator of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substance and impose liability for damage to natural resource these law often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of or wa not for the release of such hazardous substance these environmental law also ass liability on person who arrange for hazardous substance to be sent to disposal or treatment facility when such facility are found to be contaminated such person can be responsible for cleanup cost even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility we have been named responsible party at three superfund site in sunnyvale california although we have not yet been we could be named potentially responsible party at other superfund or contaminated site in the future in addition contamination that ha not yet been identified could exist at our other facility under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of the sec adopted disclosure and reporting requirement for company that use conflict mineral originating from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining country we continue to incur additional cost associated with complying with these requirement such cost related to developing internal control for the due diligence process determining the source of any conflict mineral used in our product auditing the process and reporting to our customer and the sec in addition to the sec regulation the european union china and other jurisdiction are developing new policy focused on conflict mineral that may impact and increase the cost of our compliance program also since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenge if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origin of the subject mineral moreover we are likely to encounter challenge to satisfy those customer who require that all of the component of our product are certified conflict free if we can not satisfy these customer they may choose competitor product the federal government ha issued new policy for federal procurement focused on eradicating the practice of forced labor and human trafficking in addition the united kingdom and the state of california have issued law that require to disclose our policy and practice for identifying and eliminating forced labor and human trafficking in our supply chain several customer well the electronic industry citizenship coalition eicc have also issued expectation to eliminate these practice that may impact while we have policy and management system to identify and avoid these practice in our supply chain we can not guarantee that our supplier will always be in conformance to these law and expectation we may face enforcement liability and reputational challenge if we are unable to sufficiently meet these expectation moreover we are likely to encounter challenge with customer if we can not satisfy their forced and trafficked labor police and they may choose competitor product

of principal amount of total debt of december wa billion compared to billion of december we intend the discussion of our financial condition and result of operation that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statement the change in certain key item in those financial statement from period to period the primary factor that resulted in those change and how certain accounting principle policy and estimate affect our financial statement critical accounting estimatesour discussion and analysis of our financial condition and result of operation are based upon our consolidated financial statement which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle gaap the preparation of our financial statement requires to make estimate and judgment that affect the reported amount in our consolidated financial statement we evaluate our estimate on an on going basis including those related to our revenue inventory goodwill impairment and income tax we base our estimate on historical experience and on various other assumption that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance the result of which form the basis for making judgment about the carrying value of asset and liability although actual result have historically been reasonably consistent with management expectation the actual result may differ from these estimate or our estimate may be affected by different assumption or condition management belief the following critical accounting estimate are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statement and require the most difficult subjective and complex judgment revenue allowance we record provision for estimated sale return and allowance on product sale for estimated future price reduction and other customer incentive in the same period that the related revenue are recorded we base these estimate on actual historical sale return historical allowance historical price reduction market activity and other known or anticipated trend and factor these estimate are subject to management judgment and actual provision could be different from our estimate and current provision resulting in future adjustment to our revenue and operating result inventory valuation at each balance sheet date we evaluate our ending inventory for excess quantity and obsolescence based on projected sale outlook this evaluation includes analysis of historical sale level by product and projection of future demand these projection assist in determining the carrying value of our inventory in addition we write off inventory that we consider obsolete we adjust the remaining specific inventory balance to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or net realizable value among other factor management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand competitiveness of product offering market condition and product life cycle when determining obsolescence and realizable value if in any period we anticipate future demand or market condition to be le favorable than our previous estimate additional inventory write down may be required and would be reflected in cost of sale in the period the revision is made this would have negative impact on our gross margin in that period if in any period we are able to sell inventory that were not valued or that had been written down in previous period related revenue would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sale resulting in net benefit to our gross margin in that period goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible asset acquired goodwill is not amortized but rather is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if there are indicator of impairment present we perform an annual goodwill impairment analysis of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year in the third fiscal quarter of we adopted asu intangible goodwill and other topic simplifying the test for goodwill impairment we therefore applied different impairment analysis for than wa performed in and in assessing impairment of goodwill prior to our adoption of asu we first analyzed qualitative factor to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test the qualitative factor we assessed included long term prospect of our performance share price trend market capitalization and company specific event if we concluded it wa more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit exceeded it carrying amount we needed not perform the two step impairment test if based on that assessment we believed it wa more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit wa le than it carrying value two step goodwill impairment test would be performed the first step of the two step test measure for impairment by applying fair value based test at the reporting unit level we evaluate whether goodwill ha been impaired at the reporting unit level by first determining whether the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is le than it carrying value and if so by determining whether the implied fair value of goodwill within the reporting unit is le than the carrying value the implied fair value of reporting unit is determined through the application of or more valuation model common to our industry including income market and cost approach while market valuation data for comparable company is gathered and analyzed we believe that there ha not been sufficient comparability between the peer group and the specific reporting unit to allow for the derivation of reliable indication of value using the market approach therefore we have ultimately employed the income approach which requires estimate of present value of estimated future cash flow cash flow projection are based on management estimate of revenue growth rate and operating margin taking into consideration industry and market condition the discount rate used is based on the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business specific characteristic and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit ability to execute on the projected cash flow variance in the discount rate could have significant impact on the amount of the goodwill impairment charge recorded if any the second step if necessary measure the amount of impairment by applying fair value based test to the individual asset and liability within each reporting unit in the third quarter of we adopted asu which eliminated step two from the goodwill impairment test in assessing impairment of goodwill if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of reporting unit exceeds it fair value during our qualitative assessment one step goodwill impairment test will be performed during the quantitative test if it is concluded that the carrying amount of reporting unit exceeds it fair value an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit based on the result of our annual qualitative analysis of goodwill in we determined that it wa more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded their carrying amount and such we did not need to perform the quantitative impairment test and there wa no goodwill impairment based on the result of our annual qualitative analysis of goodwill in we determined that it wa more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded their carrying amount and such we did not need to perform the two step impairment test and there wa no goodwill impairment estimate of fair value for all of our reporting unit can be affected by variety of external and internal factor potential event or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the key assumption we used in estimating the fair value of our reporting unit include adverse change in our industry increased competition an inability to successfully introduce new product in the marketplace or to achieve internal forecast and decline in our stock price if the estimated fair value of our reporting unit decline due to any of these factor we may be required to record future goodwill impairment income tax in determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purpose we must make certain estimate and judgment these estimate and judgment are applied in the calculation of certain tax liability and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax asset which arise from temporary difference between the recognition of asset and liability for tax and financial statement reporting purpose we must ass the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax asset if recovery is not likely we must increase our charge to income tax expense in the form of valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we consider past performance future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategy in determining the need for valuation allowance in addition the calculation of our tax liability involves dealing with uncertainty in the application of complex tax rule and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax position by the internal revenue service or other taxing authority if our estimate of these tax are greater or le than actual result an additional tax benefit or charge will result we recognize the interest and penalty related to unrecognized tax benefit interest expense and income tax expense respectively december the government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to the tax cut and job act of tax reform act the legislation significantly change tax law by among other thing lowering corporate income tax rate implementing modified territorial tax system and imposing transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiary the tax reform act permanently reduces the corporate income tax rate from maximum of to flat rate effective january the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no sab to address the application of gaap in situation when registrant doe not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed including computation in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effect of the tax reform act we have recognized the provisional tax impact related to deemed repatriated earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax asset and liability and included these amount in our consolidated financial statement for the year ended december the ultimate impact may differ from these provisional amount due to among other thing additional analysis change in interpretation and assumption we have made additional regulatory guidance that may be issued and action we may take result of the tax reform act the accounting is expected to be complete within one year of the date of enactment in january the fasb released guidance on the accounting for tax on the global intangible low taxed income gilti provision of the tax reform act the gilti provision impose tax on foreign income in excess of deemed return on tangible asset of foreign corporation because of the complexity of the new provision we are continuing to evaluate how the provision will be accounted for under gaap wherein company are allowed to make an accounting policy election of either account for gilti component of tax expense in the period in which we are subject to the rule the period cost method or ii account for gilti in the company measurement of deferred tax the deferred method currently we have not elected method and will only do so after we complete the analysis of the gilti provision and our election method will depend in part on analyzing our global income to determine whether we expect to have future inclusion in our taxable income related to gilti and if so the impact that is expected result of operationswe intend this discussion of our financial condition and our result of operation that follows to provide information that will assist you in understanding our financial statement the change in certain key item in those financial statement from year to year the primary factor that resulted in those change and how certain accounting

portfolio and long term debt we usually invest our cash in investment with short maturity or with frequent interest reset term accordingly our interest income fluctuates with short term market condition of december our investment portfolio consisted primarily of commercial paper these investment were highly liquid due to the relatively short weighted average maturity of our investment portfolio and the current low interest rate environment our exposure to interest rate risk is minimal of december all of our outstanding long term debt had fixed interest rate consequently our exposure to market risk for change in interest rate on reported interest expense and corresponding cash flow is minimal we will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk default risk we mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only high credit quality security and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond to significant reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor our portfolio includes investment in debt and marketable equity security with active secondary or resale market to ensure portfolio liquidity we are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested fund by limiting default risk and market risk we actively monitor market condition and development specific to the security and security class in

financial statement in conformity with generally accepted accounting principle gaap requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset and liability and disclosure of commitment and contingency at the date of the financial statement and the reported amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period actual result are likely to differ from those estimate and such difference may be material to the financial statement area where management us subjective judgment include but are not limited to revenue allowance inventory valuation valuation and impairment of goodwill valuation of investment in marketable security deferred income tax and restructuring charge revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from product sold directly to customer including original equipment manufacturer oems when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the price is fixed or determinable delivery ha occurred and collectability is reasonably assured estimate of product return allowance and future price reduction based on actual historical experience and other known or anticipated trend and factor are recorded at the time revenue is recognized the company sell to distributor under term allowing the majority of distributor certain right of return and price protection on unsold merchandise held by them the distributor agreement which may be canceled by either party upon specified notice generally contain provision for the return of those of the company product that the company ha removed from it price book and that are not more than month older than the manufacturing code date in addition some agreement with distributor may contain standard stock rotation provision permitting limited level of product return consequently the company is unable to readily estimate the product return and pricing when the product is sold to the distributor accordingly the company defers the gross margin resulting from the deferral of both revenue and related product cost from sale to distributor with agreement that have the aforementioned term until the merchandise is resold by the distributor and report such deferred amount deferred income on shipment to distributor on it consolidated balance sheet product are sold to distributor at standard published price that are contained in price book that are broadly provided to the company

not result in sale price that are le than the company product cost deferred income on shipment to distributor is revalued at the end of each period based on the change in inventory unit at distributor on the latest published price and on the latest product cost the company record estimated reduction to revenue under distributor and customer incentive program including certain cooperative advertising and marketing promotion and volume based incentive and special pricing arrangement at the time the related revenue are recognized for transaction where the company reimburses customer for

shipping and handling cost associated with product sale are included in cost of sale revenue and related product cost were follows december december in million deferred revenue cost of sale deferred income on shipment to distributor inventory are stated at standard cost adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost first in first out method or net realizable value the company adjusts inventory carrying value for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumption about future demand and market condition the company fully reserve for inventory and non cancellable purchase order for inventory deemed obsolete the company performs periodic review of inventory item to identify excess inventory on hand by comparing on hand balance to anticipated usage using recent historical activity well anticipated or forecasted demand if estimate of customer demand diminish further or market condition become le

identifiable intangible asset acquired in accordance with accounting standard codification asc goodwill and other intangible asset goodwill is not amortized but rather is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if indicator of impairment are present the company performs it annual goodwill impairment analysis of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and if certain event or circumstance indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred on an interim basis the company adopted asu intangible goodwill and other topic simplifying the test for goodwill impairment which eliminated step two from the goodwill impairment test in assessing impairment on goodwill the company first analyzes qualitative factor to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test the qualitative factor the company ass include long term prospect of it performance share price trend and market capitalization and company specific event if the company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit exceeds it carrying amount the company doe not need to perform the quantitative impairment test if based on that assessment the company belief it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is le than it carrying value quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to it carrying value goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit fair value is le than it carrying value any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit commitment and contingency from time to time the company is defendant or plaintiff in various legal action that arise in the normal course of business the company is also party to environmental matter including local regional state and federal government clean up activity at or near location where the company currently or ha in the past conducted business the company is required to ass the likelihood of any adverse judgment or outcome to these matter well potential range of reasonably possible loss determination of the amount of reserve required for these commitment and contingency that would be charged to earnings if any includes assessing the probability of adverse outcome and estimating the amount of potential loss the required reserve if any may change in the future due to new development in each matter or change in circumstance such change in settlement strategy change in required reserve could increase or decrease the company earnings in the period the change are made see note and restructuring charge restructuring charge are primarily comprised of severance cost contract and program termination cost asset impairment and cost of facility consolidation and closure restructuring charge are recorded upon approval of formal management plan and are included in the operating result of the period in which such plan is approved and the
