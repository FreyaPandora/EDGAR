workstation desktop notebook pc motherboards and game console third party distributorsour authorized channel distributor resell to sub distributor and mid sized and smaller oems and odms typically distributor handle wide variety of product and may include those that compete with our product distributor typically maintain an inventory of our product in most instance our agreement with distributor protect their inventory of our product price reduction and provide return right with respect to any product that we have removed from our price book that is le than month older than the manufacturing code date in addition some agreement with our distributor may contain standard stock rotation provision permitting limited level of product return add in board aib manufacturer and system integratorswe offer component level graphic and chipset product to aib manufacturer who in turn build and sell board level product using our technology to system integrator si retail buyer and sub distributor our agreement with aibs protect their inventory of our product against price reduction we also sell directly to our si customer si typically sell from position of regional or product based strength in the market they usually operate on short design cycle and can respond quickly with new technology si often use discrete graphic solution mean to differentiate their product and add value to their customer competition in the microprocessor and chipset marketintel corporation ha been the market share leader for microprocessor for many year intel market share margin and significant financial resource enable it to market it product aggressively to target our customer and our channel partner with special incentive and to influence customer who do business with intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturer and their channel of distribution through various brand and other marketing program additionally intel is able to drive de facto standard and specification for microprocessor that could cause and other company to have delayed access to such standard we expect intel to continue to invest heavily in marketing research and development new manufacturing facility and other technology company variety of company provide or have developed arm based microprocessor and platform arm based design being used in the pc and server market which could lead to further growth and development of the arm ecosystem in nvidia announced that it entered into an agreement to acquire arm holding nvidia is our principal competitor in the discrete graphic market our ability to compete with company who use arm based solution depends on our ability to timely design and bring to market energy efficient high performing product at an attractive price point competition in the graphic marketsin the graphic market our competitor include supplier of discrete graphic embedded graphic processor and integrated graphic processor igp chipsets intel manufacture and sell embedded graphic processor and igp chipsets and is dominant competitor with respect to this portion of our business higher unit shipment of our apus and intel integrated graphic may drive computer manufacturer to reduce the number of system they build paired with discrete graphic component particularly for notebook because they may offer satisfactory graphic performance for most mainstream pc user at lower cost intel could take action that place our discrete gpus and igp chipsets at competitive disadvantage such providing preferential access to it proprietary graphic interface or other useful information to our competitor in the graphic market or restricting access to external company while developing it own high end discrete gpus for both consumer and commercial application our principal competitor in the discrete graphic market is nvidia and they are considered the market share leader we believe that the growing complexity of graphic processor and the associated research and development cost represent high and growing barrier to entry in this market also intel ha announced that it is developing their own high end discrete gpus competition in the enterprise embedded and semi custom marketsin the server market we compete against intel with our cpu server product and nvidia with our gpu server product in the data center our principal competitor is nvidia the adoption of it proprietary cuda software platform established it market share in hpc and machine learning another competitor is intel it build product for acceleration in the data center such intel xe or habana ai processor other competitor include numerous deep learning accelerator company consisting mostly of early to late stage start ups large cloud service provider have also shown interest in building their own product to accelerate ai we are the market share leader in semi custom game console product where graphic performance is critical and where we compete primarily against nvidia research and developmentwe focus our research and development activity on improving product performance and enhancing product design our main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of cpu and gpu ip and designing that ip into our socs for our next generation of product with in each case improved system performance and performance per watt characteristic for example we are focusing on improving the battery life of our apu product for notebook and the performance and power efficiency of our discrete gpus and our microprocessor for server another important area of focus is on hpc hpc ha traditionally been synonymous with scientific computing and supercomputer but we are seeing blurring of boundary between hpc and machine learning along with high performance cpu and gpu deployment going into workstation and cloud computing data center well supercomputer we are also focusing on delivering range of low power integrated platform to serve key market including commercial client mobile computing and gaming we believe these platform will bring customer increased performance and energy efficiency we also work on advanced memory technology soc technology advance the memory can sometimes limit cpu performance and we work on improving memory technology to improve performance another area of focus is machine intelligence which is the platform for the growing field of machine learning our cpu gpus accelerator and apus offer the computation capability and the flexibility required for various deployment of machine learning we also work with industry leader on process technology software and other functional intellectual property and with others in the industry and industry consortium to conduct early stage research and development we conduct product and system research and development activity for our product in the united state with additional design and development engineering team located in canada china india taiwan and singapore who undertake specific activity at the direction of our headquarters arrangement and assembly and test facilitiesthird party wafer foundry facilitieswe have foundry arrangement with taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited tsmc for the production of wafer for certain product including the production of all our nm product we are also party to wafer supply agreement wsa with globalfoundries

licensing we rely on contract and intellectual property right to protect our product and technology from unauthorized third party copying and use intellectual property right include copyright patent patent application trademark trade secret and mask work right of december we had approximately patent in the united state and approximately patent application pending in the united state in certain case we have filed corresponding application in foreign jurisdiction including united state and foreign matter we have approximately patent matter worldwide consisting of approximately issued patent and patent application pending we expect to file future patent application in both the united state and abroad on significant invention we deem appropriate we do not believe that any individual patent or the expiration of any patent is or would be material to our business is typical in the semiconductor industry we have numerous cross licensing and technology exchange agreement with other company under which we both transfer and receive technology and intellectual property right one such agreement is the cross license agreement that we entered into with intel on november under the cross license agreement we granted to intel and intel granted to non exclusive royalty free license to all of each other patent that first filed no later than november and each party can exploit these patent anywhere in the world for making and selling certain semiconductor and electronic related product under the cross license agreement intel ha right to make semiconductor product for third party but the third party product design are not licensed result of such manufacture we have right to perform assembly and testing for third party but not right to make semiconductor product for third party the term of the cross license agreement continues the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed patent unless earlier terminated party can terminate the cross license agreement or the right and license of the other party if the other party materially breach the cross license agreement and doe not correct the noticed material breach within day upon such termination the terminated party license right terminate but the terminating party license right continue subject to that party continued compliance with the term of the cross license agreement the cross license agreement will automatically terminate if party undergoes change of control defined in the cross license agreement and both party license will terminate upon the bankruptcy of party that party may assume but may not assign the cross license agreement and in the event that the cross license agreement can not be assumed the cross license agreement and the license granted will terminate backlogsales are made primarily pursuant to purchase order for current delivery or agreement covering purchase over period of time although such order or agreement may provide visibility into future quarter they may not necessarily be indicative of actual sale for any succeeding period some of these order or agreement may be revised or canceled without penalty with respect to our semi custom soc product our order and agreement are more stringent resulting in meaningful backlog for the coming quarter operating result tend to vary seasonally historically our net revenue ha been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year although market condition and product transition could impact these trend human capitalas of december we had approximately employee in our global workforce we believe we are at our best when our culture of innovation creative mind and people from all kind of background work together in an engaging and open environment area of focus for include the

peer development we offer our employee opportunity to advance their career at amd we are focused on leadership progression and encourage our employee take advantage of new opportunity our manager and leadership development program are highly rated and we provide specialized development program for our employee environmental regulation our operation and property have in the past been and continue to be subject to various united state and foreign law and regulation including those relating to material used in our product and manufacturing process of pollutant into the environment the treatment transport storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and remediation of contamination these law and regulation require our supplier to obtain permit for operation making our product including the discharge of air pollutant and wastewater although our management system are designed to oversee our supplier compliance we can not assure you that our supplier have been or will be at all time in complete compliance with such law regulation and permit if our supplier violate or fail to comply with any of them range of consequence could result including fine suspension of production alteration of manufacturing process import export restriction sale limitation criminal and civil liability or other sanction we could also be held liable for any and all consequence arising of exposure to hazardous material used stored released disposed of by or located at under or emanating from our facility or other environmental or natural resource damage while we have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditure we can not assure you that future environmental legal requirement will not become more stringent or costly in the future therefore we can not assure you that our cost of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety law and our liability arising from past and future release of or exposure to hazardous substance will not have material adverse effect on environmental law are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time for example the european union eu and china are two among growing number of jurisdiction that have enacted restriction on the use of lead and other material in electronic product these regulation affect semiconductor device and packaging regulation restricting material in electronic product continue to increase around the world there is risk that the cost quality and manufacturing yield of product that are subject to these restriction may be le favorable compared to product that are not subject to such restriction or that the transition to compliant product may not meet customer roadmaps or produce sudden change in demand which may result in excess inventory number of jurisdiction including the eu australia california and china are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulation for computer and server based on energy star specification well additional energy consumption limit there is the potential for certain of our product being excluded from some of these market which could materially adversely affect certain environmental law including the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of or the superfund act impose strict or under certain circumstance joint and several liability on current and previous owner or operator of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substance and impose liability for damage to natural resource these law often impose liability even if the owner or operator not know of or wa not responsible for the release of such hazardous substance these environmental law also ass liability on person who arrange for hazardous substance to be sent to disposal or treatment facility when such facility are found to be contaminated such person can be responsible for cleanup cost even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility we are named responsible party on superfund clean up order for three site in sunnyvale california that are on the national priority list since we have discovered hazardous material release to the groundwater from former underground tank and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at these three site the chemical released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the united state in the wafer fabrication process prior to in we received final site clean up requirement order from the california regional water quality control board relating to the three site we have entered into settlement agreement with other responsible party on two of the order during the term of such agreement other party have agreed to assume most of the foreseeable cost well the primary role in conducting remediation activity under the order we remain responsible for additional cost beyond the scope of the agreement well all remaining cost in the event that the other party do not fulfill their obligation under the settlement agreement to address anticipated future remediation cost under the order we have computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately million and have not recorded any potential insurance recovery in determining the estimated cost of the cleanup cost could also increase result of additional test and remediation obligation imposed by the environmental protection agency or california regional water quality control board the progress of future remediation effort can not be predicted with certainty and these cost may change we believe that the potential liability if any in excess of amount already accrued will not have material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flow or result of operation risk factorsthe risk and uncertainty described below are not the only one we face if any of the following risk actually occurs our business financial condition or result of operation could be materially adversely affected in addition you should consider the interrelationship and compounding effect of two or more risk occurring simultaneously risk factor summarythe following is summary of the principal risk that could adversely affect our business operation and financial result economic and strategic risk intel corporation dominance of the microprocessor market and it aggressive

our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our business our stock price is subject to volatility worldwide political condition may adversely affect demand for our product for more complete discussion of the material risk facing our business see below and strategic risksintel corporation dominance of the microprocessor market and it aggressive business practice may limit our ability to compete effectively on level playing field intel corporation ha been the market share leader for microprocessor for many year intel market share margin and significant financial resource enable it to market it product aggressively to target our customer and our channel partner with special incentive and to influence customer who do business with these aggressive activity have in the past resulted in lower unit sale and lower average selling price for many of our product and adversely affect our margin and profitability intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturer and their channel of distribution through various brand and other marketing program result of intel position in the microprocessor market intel ha been able to control microprocessor and computer system standard and benchmark and to dictate the type of product the microprocessor market requires of intel also dominates the computer system platform which includes core logic chipsets graphic chip networking device wired and wireless non volatile storage and other component necessary to assemble computer system additionally intel is able to drive de facto standard and specification for microprocessor that could cause and other company to have delayed access to such standard long intel remains in this dominant position we may be materially adversely affected by intel business practice including rebating and allocation strategy and pricing action designed to limit our market share and margin product mix and introduction schedule product bundling marketing and merchandising strategy exclusivity payment to it current and potential customer retailer and channel partner de facto control over industry standard and heavy influence on pc manufacturer and other pc industry participant including motherboard memory chipset and basic input output system bios supplier and software company well the graphic interface for intel platform and marketing and advertising expenditure in support of positioning the intel brand over the brand of it original equipment manufacturer oem customer and retailer intel ha substantially greater financial resource than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amount on marketing and research and development than we do we expect intel to continue to invest heavily in marketing research and development new manufacturing facility and other technology company to the extent intel manufacture significantly larger portion of it microprocessor product using more advanced process technology or introduces competitive new product into the market we do we may be more vulnerable to intel aggressive marketing and pricing strategy for microprocessor product intel could also take action that place our discrete graphic processing unit gpus at competitive disadvantage including giving one or more of our competitor in the graphic market such nvidia corporation preferential access to it proprietary graphic interface or other useful information also intel ha announced that it is developing their own high end discrete gpus intel position in the microprocessor market and integrated graphic chipset market it introduction of competitive new product it existing relationship with top tier oems and it aggressive marketing and pricing strategy could result in lower unit sale and lower average selling price for our product which could have material adverse effect on global economic and market uncertainty may adversely impact our business and operating result uncertain global economic condition have in the past and may in the future adversely impact our business including without limitation slowdown in the chinese economy one of the largest global market for desktop and notebook pc uncertainty in the worldwide economic environment may negatively impact consumer confidence and spending causing our customer to postpone purchase in addition during challenging economic time our current or potential future customer may experience cash flow problem and result may modify delay or cancel plan to purchase our product additionally if our customer are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are unable to secure financing they may not be able to pay or may delay payment of account receivable that they owe the risk related to our customer potentially defaulting on or delaying payment to is increased because we expect that small number of customer will continue to account for substantial part of our revenue any inability of our current or potential future customer to pay for our product may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow moreover our key supplier may reduce their output or become insolvent thereby adversely impacting our ability to manufacture our product in addition uncertain economic condition may it more difficult for to raise fund through borrowing or private or public sale of debt or equity security the loss of significant customer may have material adverse effect on we depend on small number of customer for substantial portion of our business and we expect that small number of customer will continue to account for significant part of our revenue in the future if one of our key customer decides to stop buying our product or if one of these customer materially reduces it operation or it demand for our product our business would be materially adversely affected the ongoing novel coronavirus covid pandemic could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation the covid pandemic ha caused government authority to implement numerous public health measure including quarantine business closure travel ban and restriction related to social gathering and mobility to contain the virus we have experienced and expect to continue to experience disruption to our business these measure have and will continue to have an effect on our business operation and practice while many of our office around the world remain open either because the pandemic ha been contained in that location or to enable critical on site business function in compliance with government guideline most of our employee continue to work from home until further notice it is uncertain to when the measure put in place to attempt to contain the spread of covid will be lifted or whether there will be additional measure put into place if covid continues to spread or if there are further wave of the virus we may need to further limit operation or modify our business practice in manner that may impact our business if our employee are not able to perform their job duty due to self isolation quarantine travel restriction or illness or are unable to perform them efficiently at home for an extended period of time we may not be able to meet our product schedule roadmaps and customer commitment and we may experience an overall lower productivity of our workforce we continue to monitor our operation and public health measure implemented by governmental authority in response to covid although some public health measure have eased and small portion of our employee are at work in certain office our effort to reopen our office safely may not be successful and could expose our employee to health risk even when covid measure regarding mobility are lifted or modified our employee ability to return to work may delay the return of our full workforce and the resumption of normal business operation we have experienced some disruption to part of our supply chain the result of covid we continue to monitor demand signal we adjust our supply chain requirement based on changing customer need and demand if the supply of our product to customer is delayed reduced or canceled due to disruption encountered by our third party manufacturing supplier or vendor result of facility closure border and port closure and mobility limitation put on their workforce it could have material adverse effect on our business covid ha in the short term and may in the long term adversely impact the global economy potentially leading to an economic downturn this could negatively impact consumer confidence and spending causing our customer to postpone or cancel purchase or delay paying or default on payment of outstanding amount due to which may have material adverse effect on our business for example we experienced some softness in pc related sale in china one of the largest global market for desktop and notebook pc during the first quarter of also we experienced some delay in payment from customer due to covid during the first half of covid ha also led to disruption and volatility in the global capital and financial market while we believe our cash cash equivalent and short term investment along with our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund operation including capital expenditure over the next month to the extent we may require additional funding to finance our operation and capital expenditure and such funding may not be available to result of contracting capital and financial market resulting from covid it may have an adverse effect on our business the extent to which covid impact our business and financial result will depend on future development which are unpredictable and highly uncertain including the continued spread duration and severity of the outbreak the breadth and duration of business disruption related to covid the availability and distribution of effective vaccine and public health measure and action taken throughout the world to contain covid the prolonged effect of covid could materially adversely impact our business financial condition and result of operation the market in which our product are sold are highly competitive the market in which our product are sold are very competitive and delivering the latest and best product to market on timely basis is critical to achieving revenue growth we believe that the main factor that determine our competitiveness are timely product introduction product quality product feature and capability including enabling state of the art visual and virtual reality experience energy efficiency including power consumption and battery life reliability processor clock speed performance size or form factor selling price cost adherence to industry standard and the creation of open industry standard level of integration software and hardware compatibility security and stability brand recognition and availability we expect that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological change frequent product introduction by our competitor or new competitor of product that may provide better performance experience or that may include additional feature that render our product comparatively le competitive we may also face aggressive pricing by competitor especially during challenging economic time in addition our competitor have significant marketing and sale resource which could increase the competitive environment in declining market leading to lower price and margin some competitor may have greater access or right to complementary technology including interface processor and memory technical information for instance with our apu product and other competing solution with integrated graphic we believe that demand for additional discrete graphic chip and card may decrease in the future due to improvement in the quality and performance of integrated graphic if competitor introduce competitive new product into the market before demand for our product could be adversely impacted and our business could be adversely affected in addition intel is seeking to expand it position in integrated graphic for the pc market with high end discrete graphic solution for broad range of computing segment which may negatively impact our ability to compete in these computing segment in addition we are entering market with current and new competitor who may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirement and emerging technology we can not assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitor who may have stronger position in these new market or superior ability to anticipate customer requirement and emerging industry trend furthermore we may face competition from some of our customer who internally develop the same product we may face delay or disruption in research and development effort or we may be required to invest significantly greater resource in research and development than anticipated also the semiconductor industry ha seen several merger and acquisition over the last number of year further consolidation could adversely impact our business due to there being fewer supplier customer and partner in the industry our operating result are subject to quarterly and seasonal sale pattern the profile of our sale may be weighted differently during the year large portion of our quarterly sale have historically been made in the last month of the quarter this uneven sale pattern make prediction of revenue for each financial period difficult and increase the risk of unanticipated variation in quarterly result and financial condition in addition our operating result tend to vary seasonally with the market in which our product are sold for example historically our net revenue ha been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year although market condition and product transition could impact these trend many of the factor that create and affect quarterly and seasonal trend are beyond our control the demand for our product depends in part on the market condition in the industry into which they are sold fluctuation in demand for our product or market decline in any of these industry could have material adverse effect on our result of operation industry wide fluctuation in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected in the past and may materially adversely affect in the future large portion of our computing and graphic revenue is focused on the consumer desktop pc and notebook segment which have in the past experienced decline driven by among other factor the adoption of smaller and other form factor increased competition and change in replacement cycle the success of our semi custom soc product is dependent on securing customer for our semi custom design pipeline and consumer market condition including the success of the sony playstation sony playstation pro microsoft xbox one and microsoft xbox one game console system and next generation console for sony and microsoft worldwide in addition the gpu market ha at time seen elevated demand due to the application of gpu product to cryptocurrency mining for example our gpu revenue ha been affected in part by the volatility of the cryptocurrency mining market demand for cryptocurrency ha changed and is likely to continue to change quickly for example china and south korea have instituted restriction on cryptocurrency trading and the valuation of the currency and corresponding interest in mining of such currency are subject to significant fluctuation alternatively country may create or in the case of china are creating their own cryptocurrencies or equivalent that could also impact interest in mining if we are unable to manage the risk related to the volatility of the cryptocurrency mining market our gpu business could be materially adversely affected semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and ha experienced severe downturn that have materially adversely affected and may continue to materially adversely affect our business in the future the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and ha experienced significant downturn often in conjunction with constant and rapid technological change wide fluctuation in supply and demand continuous new product introduction price erosion and decline in general economic condition we have incurred substantial loss in recent downturn due to substantial decline in average selling price the cyclical nature of supply and demand imbalance in the semiconductor industry decline in demand for end user product such pc that incorporate our product and excess inventory level industry wide fluctuation in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected in the past and may materially adversely affect in the future global economic uncertainty and weakness have in the past impacted the semiconductor market consumer and business have deferred purchase which negatively impacted demand for our product our financial performance ha been and may in the future be negatively affected by these downturn the growth of our business is also dependent on continued demand for our product from high growth adjacent emerging global market our ability to be successful in such market depends in part on our ability to establish adequate local infrastructure well our ability to cultivate and maintain local relationship in these market if demand from these market is below our expectation sale of our product may decrease which would have material adverse effect on if we can not adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the united state and abroad through patent copyright trade secret trademark and other measure we may lose competitive advantage and incur significant expense we rely on combination of protection provided by contract including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreement copyright patent trademark and common law right such trade secret to protect our intellectual property however we can not assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property from third party infringement or from misappropriation in the united state and abroad any patent licensed by or issued to could be challenged invalidated or circumvented or right granted there under may not provide competitive advantage to also due to measure to slow the outbreak of covid various patent office and court have been adversely impacted and there is potential for delay or disruption that might affect certain of our patent right furthermore patent application that we file may not result in issuance of patent or if patent is issued the patent may not be issued in form that is advantageous to despite our effort to protect our intellectual property right others may independently develop similar product duplicate our product or design around our patent and other right in addition it is difficult to monitor compliance with and enforce our intellectual property on worldwide basis in cost effective manner in jurisdiction where foreign law provide le intellectual property protection than afforded in the united state and abroad our technology or other intellectual property may be compromised and our business would be materially adversely affected unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuation could adversely affect we have cost asset and liability that are denominated in foreign currency consequence movement in exchange rate could cause our foreign currency denominated expense to increase percentage of revenue affecting our profitability and cash flow whenever we believe appropriate we hedge portion of our short term foreign currency exposure to protect against fluctuation in currency exchange rate we determine our total foreign currency exposure using projection of long term expenditure for item such payroll we can not assure you that these activity will be effective in reducing foreign exchange rate exposure failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition result of operation and cash flow in addition the majority of our product sale are denominated in dollar fluctuation in the exchange rate between the dollar and the local currency can cause increase or decrease in the cost of our product in the local currency of such customer an appreciation of the dollar relative to the local currency could reduce sale of our product and technology riskswe rely on third party to manufacture our product and if they are unable to do so on timely basis in sufficient quantity and using competitive technology our business could be materially adversely affected we rely on third party wafer foundry to fabricate the silicon wafer for all of our product for the production of wafer for certain product including the production of all our nanometer nm product we use taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited tsmc we purchase wafer for all our cpu and apu product and wafer for certain portion of our gpu product manufactured at process node larger than nm with limited exception from globalfoundries inc gf we also rely on third party manufacturer to assemble test mark and pack atmp our product it is important to have reliable relationship with all of these third party manufacturing supplier to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand we can not guarantee that these manufacturer or our other third party manufacturing supplier will be able to meet our near term or long term manufacturing requirement if we experience supply constraint from our third party manufacturing supplier we may be required to allocate the affected product amongst our customer which could have material adverse effect on our relationship with these customer and on our financial condition in addition if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from our manufacturing supplier it could result in lost sale and have material adverse effect on our business for example if tsmc is not able to manufacture wafer for our nm product in sufficient quantity to meet customer demand it could have material adverse effect on our business we do not have long term commitment contract with some of our third party manufacturing supplier we obtain some of these manufacturing service on purchase order basis and these manufacturer are not required to provide with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantity in an existing purchase order accordingly we depend on these supplier to allocate to portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our need to produce product of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yield and to deliver those product to on timely basis and at acceptable price the manufacturer we use also fabricate wafer and atmp product for other company including certain of our competitor they could choose to prioritize capacity for other customer increase the price that they charge on short notice or reduce or eliminate delivery to which could have material adverse effect on our business other risk associated with our dependence on third party manufacturer include limited control over delivery schedule and quality assurance lack of capacity in period of excess demand misappropriation of our intellectual property dependence on several subcontractor and limited ability to manage inventory and part moreover if any of our third party manufacturer suffer any damage to facility lose benefit under material agreement experience power outage lack sufficient capacity to manufacture our product encounter financial difficulty are unable to secure necessary raw material from their supplier suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency or experience uncertain social economic or political circumstance or condition we may encounter supply delay or disruption if we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supply of product our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business if we transition the production of some of our product to new manufacturer we may experience delayed product introduction lower yield or poorer performance of our product if we experience problem with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from particular third party manufacturer or if we for other reason cease utilizing one of those supplier we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in short time frame we could experience significant delay in the shipment of our product if we are required to find alternative third party manufacturer which could have material adverse effect on our business we are party to wafer supply agreement wsa with gf that governs the term by which we purchase product manufactured by gf and is in place until pursuant to the wsa we are required to purchase wafer for all of our cpu and apu product requirement and wafer for certain portion of our gpu product requirement from gf manufactured at process node larger than nm with limited exception we have agreed to minimum annual wafer purchase target through if we fail to meet the agreed wafer purchase target during calendar year we will be required to pay to gf portion of the difference between our actual wafer purchase and the applicable annual purchase target if our actual wafer requirement are le than the number of wafer required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit cost both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our result of operation we could experience significant delay the shipment of our product if we are required to find alternative third party manufacturer which could have material adverse effect on our business we are party to two atmp joint venture collectively the atmp jv with tongfu microelectronics co ltd the majority of our atmp service are provided by the atmp jv and there is no guarantee that the atmp jv will be able to fulfill our long term atmp requirement if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the atmp jv it could result in lost sale and have material adverse effect on our business failure to achieve expected manufacturing yield for our product could negatively impact our financial result semiconductor manufacturing yield are result of both product design and process technology which is typically proprietary to the manufacturer and low yield can result from design failure process technology failure or combination of both our third party foundry are responsible for the process technology used to fabricate silicon wafer if our third party foundry experience manufacturing inefficiency or encounter disruption error or difficulty during production we may fail to achieve acceptable yield or experience product delivery delay we can not be certain that our third party foundry will be able to develop obtain or successfully implement leading edge process technology needed to manufacture future generation of our product profitably or on timely basis or that our competitor will not develop new technology product or process earlier moreover during period when foundry are implementing new process technology their manufacturing facility may not be fully productive substantial delay in the technology transition to smaller process technology could have material adverse effect on particularly if our competitor transition to more cost effective technology before for example we are presently focusing our nm product portfolio on tsmc nm process if tsmc is not able to manufacture wafer for our nm product in sufficient quantity to meet customer demand it could have material adverse effect on our business any decrease in manufacturing yield could result in an increase in per unit cost which would adversely impact our gross margin and or force to allocate our reduced product supply amongst our customer which could harm our relationship and reputation with our customer and materially adversely affect our business if essential equipment material substrate or manufacturing process are not available to manufacture our product we could be materially adversely affected we may purchase equipment material and substrate for use by our back end manufacturing service provider from number of supplier and our operation depend upon obtaining delivery of adequate supply of equipment and material on timely basis our third party supplier also depend on the same timely delivery of adequate quantity of equipment and material in the manufacture of our product in addition many of our product increase in technical complexity we rely on our third party supplier to update their process in order to continue meeting our back end manufacturing need certain equipment and material that are used in the manufacture of our product are available only from limited number of supplier or in some case sole supplier we also depend on limited number of supplier to provide the majority of certain type of integrated circuit package for our microprocessor including our apu product similarly certain non proprietary material or component such memory printed circuit board pcbs interposers substrate and capacitor used in the manufacture of our product are currently available from only limited number of source if we are unable to procure stable supply of substrate on an ongoing basis and at reasonable cost to meet our production requirement we could experience shortage in substrate supply or an increase in production cost which could have material adverse effect on our business because some of the equipment and material that we and our third party manufacturing supplier purchase are complex it is sometimes difficult to substitute one supplier for another from time to time supplier may extend lead time limit supply or increase price due to capacity constraint or other factor also some of these material and component may be subject to rapid change in price and availability interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortage and price increase in various essential material dependence on sole supplier or limited number of supplier exacerbates these risk if we are unable to procure certain of these material for our back end manufacturing operation or our third party foundry or manufacturing supplier are unable to procure material for manufacturing our product our business would be materially adversely affected the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to introduce product on timely basis with feature and performance level that provide value to our customer while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transition our success depends to significant extent on the development qualification implementation and acceptance of product design and improvement that provide value to our customer our ability to develop qualify and distribute and have manufactured new product and related technology to meet evolving industry requirement at price acceptable to our customer and on timely basis are significant factor in determining our competitiveness in our target market consumer have new product feature preference or have different requirement than those consumer in the pc market pc sale could be negatively impacted which could adversely impact our business our product roadmap includes our next generation amd ryzen amd radeon and amd epyc processor using nm process technology we can not assure you that our effort to execute our product roadmap will result in innovative product and technology that provide value to our customer if we fail to or are delayed in developing qualifying or shipping new product or technology that provide value to our customer and address these new trend or if we fail to predict which new form factor consumer will adopt and adjust our business accordingly we may lose competitive positioning which could cause to lose market share and require to discount the selling price of our product although we make substantial investment in research and development we can not be certain that we will be able to develop obtain or successfully implement new product and technology on timely basis or that they will be well received by our customer moreover our investment in new product and technology involve certain risk and uncertainty and could disrupt our ongoing business new investment may not generate sufficient revenue may incur unanticipated liability and may divert our limited resource and distract management from our current operation we can not be certain that our ongoing investment in new product and technology will be successful will meet our expectation and will not adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating result delay in developing qualifying or shipping new product can also cause to miss our customer product design window or in some case breach contractual obligation or cause to pay penalty if our customer do not include our product in the initial design of their computer system or product they will typically not use our product in their system or product until at least the next design configuration the process of being qualified for inclusion in customer system or product can be lengthy and could cause to further miss cycle in the demand of end user which also could result in loss of market share and harm our business we also depend on the success and timing of our customer platform launch if our customer delay their product launch or if our customer do not effectively market their platform with our product it could result in delay in bringing our product to market and cause to miss cycle in the demand of end user which could materially adversely affect our business in addition market demand requires that product incorporate new feature and performance standard on an industry wide basis over the life of specific product the sale price is typically reduced over time the introduction of new product and enhancement to existing product is necessary to maintain the overall corporate average selling price if we are unable to introduce new product with sufficiently high sale price or to increase unit sale volume capable of offsetting the reduction in the sale price of existing product over time our business could be materially adversely affected our receipt of revenue from our semi custom soc product is dependent upon our semi custom soc product being incorporated into customer product and the success of those product the revenue that we receive from our semi custom soc product is in the form of non recurring engineering fee charged to third party for design and development service and revenue received in connection with sale of our semi custom soc product to these third party result our ability to generate revenue from our semi custom product depends on our ability to secure customer for our semi custom design pipeline our customer desire to pursue the project and our semi custom soc product being incorporated into those customer product any revenue from sale of our semi custom soc product is directly related to sale of the third party product and reflective of their success in the market moreover we have no control over the marketing effort of these third party and we can not make any assurance that sale of their product will be successful in current or future year consequently the semi custom soc product revenue expected by may not be fully realized and our operating result may be adversely affected our product may be subject to security vulnerability that could have material adverse effect on the product that we sell are complex and may be subject to security vulnerability that could result in among other thing the loss corruption theft or misuse of confidential data or system performance issue our effort to prevent and address security vulnerability may decrease performance be only partially effective or not successful at all we may also depend on third party such customer vendor and end user to deploy our mitigation or create their own and they may delay decline or modify the implementation of such mitigation our relationship with our customer could be adversely affected some of our customer may stop purchasing our product reduce or delay future purchase of our product or use competing product any of these action by our customer could adversely affect our revenue we also are subject to claim and litigation related to spectre side exploit and may face additional claim or litigation for future vulnerability actual or perceived security vulnerability of our product may subject to adverse publicity damage to our brand and reputation and could materially harm our business or financial result it outage data loss data breach and cyber attack could compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information be costly to remediate or cause significant damage to our business reputation and operation in the ordinary course of our business we maintain sensitive data on our information technology it asset and also may maintain sensitive information on our business partner and third party provider it asset including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business and that of our customer and business partner maintaining the security of this information is important to our business and reputation we believe that company like amd have been increasingly subject to wide variety of security incident cyber attack hacking and phishing attack business and system disruption attack and other attempt to gain unauthorized access these threat can come from variety of source all ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker or insider threat to state sponsored attack cyber threat may be generic or they may be custom crafted against our information system cyber attack have become increasingly more prevalent and much harder to detect defend against or prevent our network and storage application well those of our customer business partner and third party provider may be subject to unauthorized access by hacker or breached due to operator error malfeasance or other system disruption it is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incident and the damage caused by such incident these data breach and any unauthorized access misuse or disclosure of our information or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information cyber attack on or our customer business partner or third party provider could also cause to incur significant remediation cost result in product development delay disrupt key business operation and divert attention of management and key information technology resource these incident could also subject to liability expose to significant expense and cause significant harm to our reputation and business we also maintain confidential and personally identifiable information about our worker and consumer the confidentiality and integrity of our worker and consumer data is important to our business and our worker and consumer have high expectation that we adequately protect their personal information we anticipate ongoing and increasing cost related to enhancing and implementing information security control including cost related to upgrading application computer and network security component training worker to maintain and monitor our security control remediating any data security breach and addressing the related litigation mitigating reputational harm and compliance with external regulation such the european union general data protection regulation and the california consumer privacy act we often partner with third party provider for certain worker service and we may provide certain limited worker information to such third party based on the scope of the service provided to however if these third party fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practice or in the event of breach of their network our worker data may be improperly accessed used or disclosed breach of data privacy may cause significant disruption of our business operation failure to adequately maintain and update our security system could materially adversely affect our operation and our ability to maintain worker confidence failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information it outage data loss and data breach could materially adversely affect our financial condition our competitive position and operating result uncertainty involving the ordering and shipment of our product could materially adversely affect we typically sell our product pursuant to individual purchase order we generally do not have long term supply arrangement with our customer or minimum purchase requirement except that order generally must be for standard pack quantity generally our customer may cancel order for standard product more than day prior to shipment without incurring significant fee we base our inventory level in part on customer estimate of demand for their product which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our product that our customer will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our product are sold indirectly through downstream channel distributor and customer our forecast for demand are based on estimate provided by multiple party throughout the downstream channel of our market are characterized by short product lifecycles which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion in addition our customer may change their inventory practice on short notice for any reason we may build inventory during period of anticipated growth and the cancellation or deferral of product order or overproduction due to failure of anticipated order to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory which could result in write down of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margin factor that may result in excess or obsolete inventory which could result in write down of the value of our inventory reduction in the average selling price or reduction in our gross margin include sudden or significant decrease in demand for our product production or design defect in our product higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirement failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our product including for our older product our new product are introduced or our competitor introducing new product or taking aggressive pricing action our ability to design and introduce new product in timely manner is dependent upon third party intellectual property in the design and development of new and enhanced product we rely on third party intellectual property such development and testing tool for software and hardware furthermore certain product feature may rely on intellectual property acquired from third party the design requirement necessary to meet customer demand for more feature and greater functionality from semiconductor product may exceed the capability of the third party intellectual property or development or testing tool available to if the third party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable is not available with required functionality or performance in the time frame manufacturing technology or price point needed for our new product or fails to produce design that meet customer demand our business could be materially adversely affected we depend on third party company for the design manufacture and supply of motherboards software memory and other computer platform component to support our business we depend on third party company for the design manufacture and supply of motherboards graphic card software bios operating system driver memory and other component that our customer utilize to support and or use our microprocessor gpu and apu offering we also rely on our add in board aib partner to support our gpu and apu product in addition our microprocessor are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with intel microprocessor if the designer manufacturer aibs and supplier of motherboards graphic card software memory and other component cease or reduce their design manufacture or production of current or future product that are based on or support our product our business could be materially adversely affected if we lose microsoft corporation support for our product or other software vendor do not design and develop software to run on our product our ability to sell our product could be materially adversely affected our ability to innovate beyond the instruction set controlled by intel depends partially on microsoft designing and developing it operating system to run on or support our based microprocessor product with respect to our graphic product we depend in part on microsoft to design and develop it operating system to run on or support our graphic product similarly the success of our product in the market such our apu product is dependent on independent software provider designing and developing software to run on our product if microsoft doe not continue to design and develop it operating system so that they work with our instruction set or doe not continue to develop and maintain their operating system to support our graphic product independent software provider may forego designing their software application to take advantage of our innovation and customer may not purchase pc with our product in addition some software driver licensed for use with our product are certified by microsoft if microsoft did not certify driver or if we otherwise fail to retain the support of microsoft or other software vendor our ability to market our product would be materially adversely affected our reliance on third party distributor and aib partner subject to certain risk we market and sell our product directly and through third party distributor and aib partner pursuant to agreement that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party these agreement are non exclusive and permit both our distributor and aib partner to offer our competitor product we are dependent on our distributor and aib partner to supplement our direct marketing and sale effort if any significant distributor or aib partner or substantial number of our distributor or aib partner their relationship with decided to market our competitor product over our product or decided not to market our product at all our ability to bring our product to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected in addition if we are unable to collect account receivable from our significant distributor and or aib partner it could have material adverse effect on our business if we are unable to manage the risk related to the use of our third party distributor and aib partner or offer appropriate incentive to focus them on the sale of our product our business could be materially adversely affected additionally distributor and aib partner typically maintain an inventory of our product in most instance our agreement with distributor protect their inventory of our product against price reduction well provide return right for any product that we have removed from our price book and that is not more than month older than the manufacturing date some agreement with our distributor also contain standard stock rotation provision permitting limited level of product return our agreement with aib partner protect their inventory of our product against price reduction in the event of significant decline in the price of our product the price protection right we offer would materially adversely affect because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business process and information system and modification or interruption of such system may disrupt our business process and internal control we rely upon number of internal business process and information system to support key business function and the efficient operation of these process and system is critical to our business our business process and information system need to be sufficiently scalable to support the growth of our business and may require modification or upgrade that expose to number of operational risk such our information system will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business need these change may be costly and disruptive to our operation and could impose substantial demand on management time these change may also require change in our information system modification of internal control procedure and significant training of employee and third party resource we continuously work on simplifying our information system and application through consolidation and standardization effort there can be no assurance that our business and operation will not experience any disruption in connection with this transition our information technology system and those of third party information technology provider or business partner may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstance beyond our control including catastrophic event power anomaly or outage natural disaster virus or malware cyber attack data breach and computer system or network failure exposing to significant cost reputational harm and disruption or damage to our business in addition our it environment continues to evolve we are embracing new way of communicating and sharing data internally and externally with customer and partner using method such mobility and the cloud that can promote business efficiency however these practice can also result in more distributed it environment making it more difficult for to maintain visibility and control over internal and external user and meet scalability and administrative requirement if our security control can not keep pace with the speed of these change or if we are not able to meet regulatory and compliance requirement our business would be materially adversely affected if our product are not compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware we could be materially adversely affected our product may not be fully compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware further we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problem in timely manner if our customer are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware we could be materially adversely affected in addition the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our product could have material adverse effect on our business cost related to defective product could have material adverse effect on product complex those we offer may contain defect or failure when first introduced or when new version or enhancement to existing product are released we can not assure you that despite our testing procedure error will not be found in new product or release after commencement of commercial shipment in the future which could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our product material recall and replacement cost loss of revenue writing down the inventory of defective product the diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from product development effort defending against litigation related to defective product or related liability including property damage personal injury damage to our reputation in the industry and loss of data or property and could adversely affect our relationship with our customer in addition we may have difficulty identifying the end customer of the defective product in the field result we could incur substantial cost to implement modification to correct defect any of these problem could materially adversely affect our business we could be subject to potential product liability claim if one of our product cause or merely appears to have caused an injury whether tangible or intangible claim may be made by consumer or others selling our product and we may be subject to claim against even if an alleged injury is due to the action of others product liability claim recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liability or for amount in excess of insured liability could have material adverse effect on our business if we fail to maintain the efficiency of our supply chain we respond to change in customer demand for our product our business could be materially adversely affected our ability to meet customer demand for our product depends in part on our ability to deliver the product our customer want on timely basis accordingly we rely on our supply chain for the manufacturing distribution and fulfillment of our product we continue to grow our business expand to high growth adjacent market acquire new customer and strengthen relationship with existing customer the efficiency of our supply chain will become increasingly important because many of our customer tend to have specific requirement for particular product and specific time frame in which they require delivery of these product if we are unable to consistently deliver the right product to our customer on timely basis in the right location our customer may reduce the quantity they order from which could have material adverse effect on our business we outsource to third party certain supply chain logistics function including portion of our product distribution transportation management and information technology support service we rely on third party provider to operate our regional product distribution center and to manage the transportation of our work in process and finished product among our facility to our manufacturing supplier and to our customer in addition we rely on third party to provide certain information technology service to including help desk support desktop application service business and software support application server and storage administration data center operation database administration and voice video and remote access we can not guarantee that these provider will fulfill their respective responsibility in timely manner in accordance with the contract term in which case our internal operation and the distribution of our product to our customer could be materially adversely affected also we can not guarantee that our contract with these third party provider will be renewed in which case we would have to transition these function in house or secure new provider which could have material adverse effect on our business if the transition is not executed appropriately our inability to effectively control the sale of our product on the gray market could have material adverse effect on we market and sell our product directly to oems and through authorized third party distributor from time to time our product are diverted from our authorized distribution channel and are sold on the gray market gray market product result in shadow inventory that is not visible to thus making it difficult to forecast demand accurately also when gray market product enter the market we and our distribution channel compete with these heavily discounted gray market product which adversely affect demand for our product and negatively impact our margin in addition our inability to control gray market activity could result in customer satisfaction issue because any time product are purchased outside our authorized distribution channel there is risk that our customer are buying counterfeit or substandard product including product that may have been altered mishandled or damaged or are used product represented new and regulatory risksgovernment action and regulation such export administration regulation tariff and trade protection measure may limit our ability to export our product to certain customer we have equity interest in two joint venture collectively the thatic jv with higon information technology co ltd thatic third party chinese entity in june the bureau of industry and security bi of the united state department of commerce added certain chinese entity to the entity list including thatic and the thatic jv in october the bi added additional chinese entity to the entity list also the united state administration ha called for change to domestic and foreign policy specifically united state china trade relation remain uncertain the united state administration ha announced tariff on certain product imported into the united state with china the country of origin and china ha imposed tariff in response to the action of the united state we are taking step to mitigate the impact of these tariff on our business and amd processor based product there is also possibility of future tariff trade protection measure import or export regulation or other restriction imposed on our product or on our customer by the united state china or other country that could have material adverse effect on our business significant trade disruption or the establishment or increase of any tariff trade protection measure or restriction could result in lost sale adversely impacting our reputation and business if we can not realize our deferred tax asset our result of operation could be adversely affected in the fourth quarter of we reduced the valuation allowance against significant portion of our deferred tax asset resulting in billion of deferred tax asset on our balance sheet our deferred tax asset include net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income and reduce income tax payable in future period each quarter we consider both positive and negative evidence to determine whether all or portion of the deferred tax asset are more likely than not to be realized if we determine that some or all of our deferred tax asset are not realizable it could result in material expense in the period in which this determination is made which may have material adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operation in addition

action for example described in note of our consolidated financial statement we have been subject to certain claim concerning federal security law and corporate governance our product are purchased by and or used by consumer which could increase our exposure to consumer action such product liability claim and consumer class action claim including those described in note of our consolidated financial statement on occasion we receive claim that individual were allegedly exposed to substance used in our former semiconductor wafer manufacturing facility and that this alleged exposure caused harm litigation can involve complex factual and legal question and it outcome is uncertain it is possible that if claim is successfully asserted against including the claim described in note of our consolidated financial statement it could result in the payment of damage that could be material to our business respect to intellectual property litigation from time to time we have been notified of or third party may bring or have brought action against and or against our customer based on allegation that we are infringing the intellectual property right of others contributing to or inducing the infringement of the intellectual property right of others improperly claiming ownership of intellectual property or otherwise improperly using the intellectual property of others if any such claim are

related to our intellectual property right or the intellectual property right of others can always be avoided or successfully concluded even if we were to prevail any litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operation which could have material adverse effect on we are subject to environmental law conflict mineral related provision of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act well variety of other law or regulation that could result in additional cost and liability our operation and property have in the past been and continue to be subject to various united state and foreign law and regulation including those relating to material used in our product and manufacturing process discharge of pollutant into the environment the treatment transport storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and remediation of contamination these law and regulation require our supplier to obtain permit for operation making our product including the discharge of air pollutant and wastewater although our management system are designed to oversee our supplier compliance we can not assure you that our supplier have been or will be at all time in complete compliance with such law regulation and permit if our supplier violate or fail to comply with any of them range of consequence could result including fine suspension of production alteration of manufacturing process import export restriction sale limitation criminal and civil liability or other sanction such non compliance from our manufacturing supplier could result in disruption in supply higher sourcing cost and or reputational damage for environmental law are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time for example the european union eu and china are two among growing number of jurisdiction that have enacted restriction on the use of lead and other material in electronic product these regulation affect semiconductor device and packaging regulation restricting material in electronic product continue to increase around the world there is risk that the cost quality and manufacturing yield of product that are subject to these restriction may be le favorable compared to product that are not subject to such restriction or that the transition to compliant product may not meet customer roadmaps or produce sudden change in demand which may result in excess inventory number of jurisdiction including the eu australia california and china are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulation for computer and server based on energy star specification well additional energy consumption limit there is the potential for certain of our product being excluded from some of these market which could materially adversely affect certain environmental law including the united state comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of or the superfund act impose strict or under certain circumstance joint and several liability on current and previous owner or operator of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substance and impose liability for damage to natural resource these law often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of or wa not responsible for the release of such hazardous substance these environmental law also ass liability on person who arrange for hazardous substance to be sent to disposal or treatment facility when such facility are found to be contaminated such person can be responsible for cleanup cost even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility we have been named responsible party at three superfund site in sunnyvale california although we have not yet been we could be named potentially responsible party at other superfund or contaminated site in the future in addition contamination that ha not yet been identified could exist at our other facility the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of the sec adopted disclosure and reporting requirement for company that use conflict mineral originating from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining country we continue to incur additional cost associated with complying with these requirement such cost related to developing internal control for the due diligence process determining the source of any conflict mineral used in our product auditing the process and reporting to our customer and the sec in addition to the sec regulation the european union china and other jurisdiction are developing new policy focused on conflict mineral that may impact and increase the cost of our compliance program also since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenge if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origin of the subject mineral moreover we are likely to encounter challenge to satisfy those customer who require that all of the component of our product be certified conflict free if we can not satisfy these customer they may choose competitor product the united state federal government ha issued new policy for federal procurement focused on eradicating the practice of forced labor and human trafficking germany federal procurement office in collaboration with the bitkom trade association issued new supply chain labor requirement in addition the united kingdom australia and the state of california have issued law that require to disclose our policy and practice for identifying and eliminating forced labor and human trafficking in our supply chain several customer well the responsible business alliance have also issued expectation to eliminate these practice that may impact while we have policy and management system to identify and avoid these practice in our supply chain we can not guarantee that our supplier will always be in conformance to these law and expectation we may face enforcement liability and reputational challenge if we are unable to sufficiently meet these expectation moreover we are likely to encounter challenge with customer if we can not satisfy their forced and trafficked labor police and they may choose competitor product xilinx merger and acquisition risksacquisitions joint venture and or investment including our recently announced acquisition of xilinx and the failure to integrate acquired business could disrupt our business and or dilute or adversely affect the price of our common stock our success will depend in part on our ability to expand our product offering and grow our business in response to changing technology customer demand and competitive pressure in some circumstance we may pursue growth through the acquisition of complementary business solution or technology or through joint venture or investment rather than through internal development the identification of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidate can be difficult time consuming and costly and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisition or joint venture for example on october we along with direct wholly owned subsidiary of ours entered into an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement with xilinx inc xilinx whereby we agreed to acquire xilinx the merger we entered into the merger agreement with the belief that the merger will result in certain benefit including certain operational synergy and cost efficiency and drive product innovation achieving these anticipated benefit will depend on successfully combining our and xilinx business together it is not certain that xilinx business can be successfully integrated with our business in timely manner or at all or that any of the anticipated benefit will be realized for variety of reason including but not limited to failure to obtain applicable regulatory or stockholder approval in timely manner or otherwise failure to satisfy other closing condition to the merger our inability to integrate or benefit from xilinx acquired technology or service in profitable manner diversion of capital and other resource including management attention from our existing business unanticipated cost or liability associated with the merger failure to leverage the increased scale of the combined business quickly and effectively coordinating and integrating in country in which we have not previously operated the potential impact of the merger on our relationship with employee vendor supplier and customer the impairment of relationship with or the loss of xilinx employee vendor supplier and customer adverse change in general economic condition in region in which we and xilinx operate potential litigation associated with the merger difficulty in the assimilation of employee and culture difficulty in managing the expanded operation of larger and more complex company challenge in attracting and retaining key personnel and difficulty with harmonizing our and xilinx financial reporting system many of these factor will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased cost decrease in expected revenue and diversion of management time and attention which could materially impact the combined company in addition even if the operation of the business are integrated successfully the full benefit of the merger may not be realized within the anticipated time frame or at all all of these factor could decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the merger and negatively impact the combined company if we can not successfully integrate our xilinx business and operation or if there are delay in combining the business it could negatively impact our ability to develop or sell new product and impair our ability to grow our business which in turn could adversely affect our financial condition and operating result acquisition and joint venture may also involve the entry into geographic or business market in which we have little or no prior experience consequently we may not achieve anticipated benefit of acquisition or joint venture which could harm our operating result in addition to complete an acquisition and contemplated in the merger we may issue equity security which would dilute our stockholder ownership and could adversely affect the price of our common stock and or incur debt assume contingent liability or have amortization expense and write down of acquired asset which could adversely affect our result of operation moreover if such acquisition or joint venture require to seek additional debt or equity financing we may not be able to obtain such financing on term favorable to or at all even if we successfully complete an acquisition or joint venture we may not be able to assimilate and integrate effectively or efficiently the acquired business technology solution asset personnel or operation particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for acquisition and joint venture may also reduce our cash available for operation and other us which could harm our business also any failure on our part to effectively evaluate and execute new business initiative could adversely affect our business we may not adequately ass the risk of new business initiative and subsequent event may arise that alter the risk that were initially considered furthermore we may not achieve the objective and expectation with respect to future operation product and service the majority of our atmp service are provided by the atmp jv and there is no guarantee that the jv will be able to fulfill our long term atmp requirement if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the atmp jv it could result in lost sale and have material adverse effect on our business in addition we may not realize the anticipated benefit from our business initiative for example we may not realize the expected benefit from the thatic jv expected future performance including the receipt of any future milestone payment and any royalty from certain licensed intellectual property in june the bi added certain chinese entity to the entity list including thatic and the thatic jv we are complying with law pertaining to the entity list designation our ability to complete the merger is subject to closing condition including approval by our and xilinx stockholder and the receipt of consent and approval from governmental authority which may impose condition that could adversely affect or cause the merger not to be completed the merger is subject to number of closing condition specified in the merger agreement these include among others approval by our and xilinx stockholder the receipt of approval under certain competition law and the absence of governmental restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the merger no assurance can be given that the required consent and approval will be obtained or that the closing condition will be satisfied in timely manner or at all any delay in completing the merger could cause the combined company not to realize or to be delayed in realizing some or all of the benefit that we expect to achieve in addition we can provide no assurance that these condition will not result in the abandonment or delay of the merger the occurrence of any of these event could have material adverse effect on our result of operation and the trading price of our common stock additionally under the merger agreement xilinx will be required to pay termination fee to equal to billion if the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstance including if the merger agreement is terminated because xilinx board of director ha changed it recommendation we will be required to pay termination fee to xilinx equal to billion if the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstance including if the merger agreement is terminated because our board of director ha changed it recommendation we will be required to pay termination fee equal to billion if the merger agreement is terminated in certain circumstance related to the failure to obtain required regulatory approval by october subject to automatic extension first to january and then to april in each case to the extent the regulatory closing condition remain outstanding whether or not it is completed the announcement and pendency of the merger could cause disruption in our business which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial result whether or not it is completed the announcement and pendency of the merger could cause disruption in our business our and xilinx current and prospective employee may experience uncertainty about their future role with the combined company which might adversely affect the ability to retain key employee uncertainty regarding the completion of the merger may cause customer supplier distributor vendor strategic partner or others to delay or defer entering into contract make other decision or seek to change or cancel existing business and the attention of management may be directed toward the completion of the merger if the merger is not completed we will have incurred significant cost including the potential payment of termination fee and the diversion of management resource for which we will have received little or no benefit any impairment of the combined company tangible definite lived intangible or indefinite lived intangibleassets including goodwill may adversely impact the combined company financial position and result of operation the merger will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting under the provision of asc business combination with amd representing the accounting acquirer under this guidance we will record asset acquired including identifiable intangible asset and liability assumed from xilinx at their respective fair value at the date of completion of the merger any excess of the purchase price over the net fair value of such asset and liability will be recorded goodwill in connection with the merger the combined company is expected to record significant goodwill and other intangible asset on it consolidated balance sheet indefinite lived intangible asset including goodwill will be tested for impairment at least annually and all tangible and intangible asset including goodwill will be tested for impairment when certain indicator are present if in the future the combined company determines that tangible or intangible asset including goodwill are impaired the combined company would record an impairment charge at that time impairment testing of goodwill and intangible asset requires significant use of judgment and assumption particularly it relates to the determination of fair value decrease in the long term economic outlook and future cash flow of the combined company business could significantly impact asset value and potentially result in the impairment of intangible asset including goodwill which may have material adverse impact on the combined company financial position and result of operation liquidity and capital resource risk the

and vms for use to improve real time analysis on large volume of data streaming from application website and more we also expanded our embedded processor family with two new amd ryzen embedded low power processor that provide customer with thermal design power tdp range of up to watt in november we launched the amd ryzen embedded series processor built on nm process technology zen core and high performance amd radeon graphic while the current covid pandemic continues to impact our business operation and practice and we expect that it may continue to impact our business we experienced limited financial disruption during although many of our office remained open to enable critical on site business function in accordance with local government guideline most of our employee worked from home

requirement based on changing customer need and demand we also ass our product schedule and roadmaps to make any adjustment that may be necessary to support remote working requirement and address the geographic and market demand shift caused by covid part of our strategy to establish amd the industry high performance computing leader we announced in october that we entered into definitive agreement to acquire xilinx inc in an all stock transaction the transaction is currently expected to close by the end of calendar year we intend the discussion of our financial condition and result of operation that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statement the change in certain key item in those financial statement from period to period the primary factor that resulted in those change and how certain accounting principle policy and estimate affect our financial statement critical accounting estimatesour discussion and analysis of our financial condition and result of operation are based upon our consolidated financial statement which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle gaap the preparation of our financial statement requires to make estimate and judgment that affect the reported amount in our consolidated financial statement we evaluate our estimate on an on going basis including those related to our revenue inventory goodwill and income tax we base our estimate on historical experience and on various other assumption that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance the result of which form the basis for making judgment about the carrying value of asset and liability although actual result have historically been reasonably consistent with management expectation the actual result may differ from these estimate or our estimate may be affected by different assumption or condition management belief the following critical accounting estimate are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statement and require the most difficult subjective and complex judgment revenue allowance revenue contract with our customer include variable amount which we evaluate under asc through in order to determine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled and which we recognize revenue we determine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer after adjustment to the contract price for right of return and rebate to our oem customer and right of return rebate and price protection on unsold merchandise to our distributor customer we base our determination of necessary adjustment to the contract price by reference to actual historical activity and experience including actual historical return rebate and credit issued to oem and distributor customer adjusted applicable to include adjustment if any for known event or current economic condition or both our estimate of necessary adjustment for distributor price incentive and price protection on unsold product held by distributor are based on actual historical incentive provided to distributor customer and known future price movement based on our internal and external market data analysis our estimate of necessary adjustment for oem price incentive utilize in addition to known pricing agreement actual historical rebate attainment rate and estimate of future oem rebate program attainment based on internal and external market data analysis offer incentive program through cooperative advertising and marketing promotion where fund provided for such program can be estimated we recognize reduction to revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized otherwise we recognize such reduction to revenue at the later of when the related revenue transaction occurs or ii the program is offered for transaction where we reimburse customer for portion of the customer cost to perform specific product advertising or marketing and promotional activity such amount are recognized reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition we also provide limited product return right to certain oems and to most distribution customer these return right are generally limited to contractual percentage of the customer prior quarter shipment although from time to time we may approve additional product return beyond the contractual arrangement based on the applicable fact and circumstance in order to estimate adjustment to revenue to account for these return including product restocking right provided to distributor and oem customer we utilize relevant trended actual historical product return rate information gathered adjusted for actual known information or event applicable overall our estimate of adjustment to contract price due to variable consideration under our contract with oem and distributor customer based on our assumption and include adjustment if any for known event have been materially consistent with actual result however these estimate are subject to management judgment and actual provision could be different from our estimate and current provision resulting in future adjustment to our revenue and operating result inventory valuation we value inventory at standard cost adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumption about future demand and market condition material assumption we use to estimate necessary inventory carrying value adjustment can be unique to each product and are based on specific fact and circumstance in determining excess or obsolescence reserve for product we consider assumption such change in business and economic condition other than temporary decrease in demand for our product and change in technology or customer requirement in determining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserve we consider assumption such recent historical sale activity and selling price well estimate of future selling price if in any period we anticipate change in assumption such future demand or market condition to be le favorable than our previous estimate additional inventory write down may be required and would be reflected in cost of sale resulting in negative impact to our gross margin in that period if in any period we are able to sell inventory that had been written down to level below the ultimate realized selling price in previous period related revenue would be recorded with lower or no offsetting charge to cost of sale resulting in net benefit to our gross margin in that period overall our estimate of inventory carrying value adjustment have been materially consistent with actual result goodwill we perform our goodwill impairment analysis of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and if certain event or circumstance indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred on more frequent basis the analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factor to ass the likelihood of an impairment we first analyze qualitative factor to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit exceeds it carrying amount qualitative factor include industry and market consideration overall financial performance share price trend and market capitalization and company specific event if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit exceeds it carrying amount we do not proceed to perform quantitative impairment test if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is le than it carrying value quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to it carrying value quantitative impairment analysis if necessary considers the income approach which requires estimate of the present value of expected future cash flow to determine reporting unit fair value significant estimate include revenue growth rate and operating margin used to calculate projected future cash flow discount rate and future economic and market condition goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which reporting unit fair value is le than it carrying value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit income tax in determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purpose we must make certain estimate and judgment these estimate and judgment are applied in the calculation of certain tax liability and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax asset which arise from temporary difference between the recognition of asset and liability for tax and financial statement reporting purpose regularly ass the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax asset unless recovery is considered more likely than not probability level of more than we will record charge to income tax expense in the form of valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable or maintain the valuation allowance recorded in prior period when considering all available evidence if we determine it is more likely than not we will realize our deferred tax asset we will reverse some or all of the existing valuation allowance which would result in credit to income tax expense and the establishment of an asset in the period of reversal in determining the need to establish or maintain valuation allowance we consider the four source of jurisdictional taxable income carryback of net operating loss to prior year ii future reversal of existing taxable temporary difference iii viable and prudent tax planning strategy and iv future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary difference and carryforwards through the end of we demonstrated consistent continued and increasing profitability over the preceding three year period our ability to sustain and grow our profitability is supported by the continued positive momentum of our consumer and commercial product including our newly released desktop mobile and graphic processor greater market acceptance for our server product the successful adoption of our new game console processor product and our leadership in the continued development of hpc product in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax asset we considered the highly dynamic and competitive landscape of our industry the continued performance and market acceptance of our new product and the impact of such market acceptance on our estimate of future profitability result in the fourth quarter of we concluded that our history of profitable operating result including the current period result along with increasingly favorable forecast of continued future profitability provided sufficient positive evidence supporting the realizability of certain amount of our deferred tax asset accordingly the release of the related valuation allowance previously recorded against these deferred tax asset resulting in tax benefit of billion in the fourth quarter of we continue to maintain valuation allowance of approximately billion for certain federal state and foreign tax attribute the federal valuation allowance maintained is due to current limitation including limitation under internal revenue code section or separate return loss year rule or dual consolidated loss rule the state and foreign valuation allowance maintained is due to lack of sufficient source of income in addition the calculation of our tax liability involves addressing uncertainty in the application of complex multi jurisdictional tax rule and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax position by the internal revenue service or other taxing authority if our estimate of these tax are greater or le than actual result an additional tax benefit or charge could result result of operationswe report our financial performance based on the following two reportable segment the computing and graphic segment and the enterprise embedded and semi custom segment additional information on our reportable segment is contained in note segment reporting of the note to financial statement part ii item of this form our operating result tend to vary seasonally historically our net revenue ha been generally higher in the second half of the year

favorable forecast of continued future profitability provided sufficient positive evidence supporting the realizability of certain amount of our deferred tax asset and accordingly the release of the related valuation allowance previously recorded against these deferred tax asset resulting in tax benefit of billion in the fourth quarter of we continue to maintain valuation allowance of approximately billion for certain federal state and foreign tax attribute the federal valuation allowance maintained is due to current limitation including limitation under internal revenue code

benefit of billion in and an income tax provision of million in the income tax benefit in wa primarily due to billion of tax benefit from the valuation allowance release in the this benefit wa partially offset by approximately million of withholding tax expense related to cross border transaction million of state and foreign tax and million increase in valuation allowance against certain

contractual obligation table off balance sheet arrangementsas of december we had no off balance sheet arrangement quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for change in interest rate relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long term debt we usually invest our cash in investment with short maturity or with frequent interest reset term accordingly our interest income fluctuates with short term market condition of december our investment portfolio consisted of time deposit and commercial paper due to the relatively short weighted average maturity of our investment portfolio and the current low interest rate environment our exposure to interest rate risk is minimal of december all of our outstanding long term debt had fixed interest rate consequently our exposure to market risk for change in interest rate on reported interest expense and corresponding cash flow is minimal we will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk default risk we mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only high credit quality security and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond to significant reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor our portfolio includes investment in marketable debt security with active secondary or resale market to ensure portfolio liquidity we are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested fund by limiting default risk and market risk we actively monitor market condition and development specific to the security and security class in which we invest we believe that we take conservative approach to investing our fund in that we invest only in highly rated debt security with relatively short maturity and do not invest in security which we believe involve higher degree of risk of december substantially all of our investment in debt security were rated by at least one of the rating agency while we believe we take prudent measure to mitigate investment related risk such risk can not be fully eliminated there are circumstance outside of our control foreign exchange risk
