available including content from dtc streaming and other ott service provider online medium and other digital source in addition advertising revenue is adversely affected by the growing use of

of our production cost for these broadcast and the amortization of the related right fee revenue in cable communication cable network broadcast television and sky is also subject to cyclical advertising pattern and change in viewership level advertising revenue in the united state is generally higher in the second and fourth quarter of each year and in even numbered year due to increase in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season and advertising related to candidate running for political office and issue oriented advertising

fourth quarter of each year advertising revenue at sky typically ha seasonally higher audience level in winter month and increased competition in the summer during major sporting event where public

our dth and dtc streaming service including the start of the new soccer season and the christmas holiday this generally result in greater net customer relationship addition and higher subscriber acquisition cost in the second half of each year due to higher marketing expense exclusive sport right such european soccer play key role within sky wider content strategy in europe broadcasting right

right agreement require payment at the start of each season resulting in increase in sport right payment in the third and fourth quarter of each year legislation and regulationwhile all of our business are subject to various federal state and local law and regulation compliance with certain law and regulation is most material with respect to our cable communication and broadcast television business in the united state specifically the communication act of amended the communication act and federal communication commission fcc regulation and policy affect significant aspect of our cable communication and broadcast business in the united state and these business are also subject to other regulation by federal state and local authority in addition our international business are subject to the law and the jurisdiction of the foreign regulatory authority where they operate beyond any significant regulation summarized below legislator and regulator at all level of government frequently consider changing and sometimes change existing statute rule or regulation or interpretation of existing statute rule or regulation or prescribe new one any of which may significantly affect our business and ability to effectively compete these legislator and regulator have been active in considering rulemakings and legislation at time looking to adopt regulatory approach from different country that may be more burdensome and they along with some state attorney general and foreign governmental authority have also been active in conducting inquiry and review regarding our service state legislative and regulatory initiative can create patchwork of different and or conflicting state requirement such with respect to privacy and open internet net neutrality regulation that can affect our business operation and further constrain our ability to compete comcast annual report on form of contentslegislative and regulatory activity may increase with the change in administration following the presidential election for example the congress may consider proposal that address communication issue including whether it rewrite the entire communication act to account for change in the communication marketplace whether it should enact new permanent open internet net neutrality requirement and whether it should fund new broadband infrastructure or broadband connectivity initiative any of these regulation could significantly affect our business and compliance cost in addition united state and foreign regulator and court could adopt new interpretation of existing competition law or enact new competition law or regulatory tool that could negatively impact our business with the change in administration tax legislation could be enacted increasing the federal corporate income tax from the current rate of any future legislative judicial regulatory or administrative action may increase our cost or impose additional restriction on our business some of which may be significant we are unable to predict the outcome or effect of any of these potential action or any other legislative or regulatory proposal on our business the following paragraph summarize the significant legal and regulatory requirement affecting our business communication related regulation in the united stateshigh speed internetour high speed internet service are subject to number of regulation and commitment the fcc frequently considers imposing new broadband related regulation such those relating to an open internet state and locality also consider new broadband related regulation including those regarding government owned broadband network net neutrality and connectivity during covid new broadband regulation if adopted may have adverse effect on our business in addition an internet service provider isp we must implement certain network capability to assist law enforcement in conducting surveillance of person suspected of criminal activity from time to time the fcc considers imposing new regulatory obligation on isps open internet regulationsvarious form of open internet regulation can significantly affect our high speed internet service in the fcc reversed it prior classification of broadband internet access service title ii telecommunication service under the communication act and classified it an information service under title in addition it eliminated it prior net neutrality rule prohibiting isps from blocking access to lawful content on the internet impairing or degrading lawful internet traffic on the basis of content application or service throttling prioritizing certain internet traffic in exchange for consideration or in favor of an affiliate paid or affiliated prioritization and generally prohibiting isps from unreasonably interfering with or unreasonably disadvantaging consumer ability to access and use the lawful internet content application service or device of their choosing or unreasonably interfering with or disadvantaging edge provider ability to make lawful content application service or device available to consumer general conduct standard the fcc stated that jurisdiction to regulate isp conduct would rest at the federal trade commission ftc and it expressly preempted all state open internet law in addition the fcc revised the transparency rule to add requirement that isps disclose any blocking and throttling practice and any paid or affiliated prioritization practice associated with their broadband offering we have disclosed that we do not block throttle or engage in paid or affiliated prioritization and have committed not to block throttle or discriminate lawful content the ftc ha authority to enforce these public commitment and the fcc ha authority to enforce compliance with it transparency rule the fcc decision wa challenged and in the court of appeal for the district of columbia largely upheld the fcc decision including the classification of broadband title information service and repeal of it prior rule however it vacated the fcc express preemption of all state open internet law but noted that state law may nevertheless be preempted on case by case basis if those regulation conflict with federal law or policy or under other theory and precedent on implied preemption several state have passed or introduced legislation or have adopted executive order that impose open internet requirement in variety of way and new state legislation may be introduced and adopted in the future certain of these state initiative have been challenged in court such attempt by the state to regulate have the potential to create differing and or conflicting state regulation the fcc under the new administration likely will revisit the regulatory classification of broadband internet access service and reclassify broadband internet access service telecommunication service which would authorize the fcc to subject it to traditional common carriage regulation under title ii of the communication act under title ii framework the fcc could potentially regulate our customer rate speed data usage threshold or other term for internet service and could prohibit or seriously restrict arrangement between and internet content application and service provider including backbone annual report on form ktable of contentsinterconnection arrangement any fcc action could impact state open internet initiative and related legal challenge and also could prompt further litigation congress may also consider legislation addressing these regulation and the regulatory framework for broadband internet access service we can not predict whether or the rule might be changed the impact of potential new legislation or the outcome of any litigation broadband deployment infrastructure initiativesbeginning in the fcc adopted series of order aimed at removing barrier to the deployment of broadband infrastructure including the preemption of certain state and local law or regulation that may unreasonably impede the deployment of wireless broadband network over time these order may have the effect of creating regulatory imbalance that favor wireless service over wireline broadband service like our own we can not predict the extent to which the fcc might adopt similar order in the future whether such future order would be upheld if appealed how state or local law or regulation may be impacted or how such change may affect our business there also have been and may continue to be broadband deployment funding initiative at the federal and state level including part of covid relief effort that could subsidize other service provider building network within our footprint or potentially subsidize expansion of our network to new area we can not predict how such fund will be awarded or the impact of these initiative on our business municipally owned broadband networksa number of local municipality operate municipally owned broadband network and there may be further effort by local government to expand or create government owned network certain state have enacted law that restrict or prohibit local municipality from operating municipally owned broadband network and there may be effort in other state legislature to restrict the development of government owned network although some may choose to ease or facilitate such network we can not predict how successful those effort will be and how they might affect our business video the video marketplace is quickly evolving and continues to become even more competitive particularly new dtc streaming and other ott service provider enter the market at growing pace there are number of law and regulation that apply solely to multichannel video programming distributor mvpds or cable operator and to cable network and local broadcast television station these law and regulation can constrain our ability to compete particularly against new online provider which are not subject to these same requirement cable pricing and packagingwhile the vast majority of our video service including equipment and installation fee are no longer subject to rate regulation by the fcc certain state entity monitor and challenge in court the marketing and advertising of our service and some have attempted to regulate the service package we offer and our billing practice we can not predict the outcome of any current litigation with state entity or whether other state may pursue similar action cable franchisingcable operator generally operate their cable system under nonexclusive franchise granted by local or state franchising authority the term and condition of franchise vary materially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction franchise typically last for fixed term obligate the franchisee to pay franchise fee and meet service quality customer service and other requirement and are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provision franchising authority also may require adequate channel capacity facility and financial support for public educational and governmental access programming and other in kind contribution the communication act also contains provision governing the franchising process including renewal procedure designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denial of renewal and unreasonable renewal condition we believe that our franchise renewal prospect are generally favorable but can not guarantee the future renewal of any individual franchise the fcc adopted an order in that prohibits state and local authority from imposing duplicative franchise and or fee requirement on the provision of broadband and other non cable service over franchised cable system and ruling that in kind contribution are treated franchise fee subject to the statutory cap on franchise fee of of cable service revenue unless those contribution are expressly excluded by the communication act the order ha been appealed and we can not predict the outcome of this litigation program carriagefcc regulation prohibit from unreasonably restraining the ability of an unaffiliated video programming network to compete fairly by discriminating against the network on the basis of it non affiliation in the selection term or condition for it carriage in addition cable operator and other mvpds in the united state are prohibited from requiring condition of comcast annual report on form of contentscarriage financial interest in or exclusive distribution right for video programming network we have been involved in program carriage dispute at the fcc well in the court and may be subject to new complaint in the future program accessthe communication act and fcc regulation generally prevent cable network affiliated with cable operator from favoring affiliated cable operator over competing mvpds the fcc and congress have considered proposal that would require company that own multiple cable network to make each of their network available individually when negotiating distribution agreement with mvpds and potentially with dtc streaming and other ott service provider maine ha enacted law mandating retail la carte distribution by cable operator that may have similar effect the maine statute ha been appealed and is currently stayed by the court but we can not predict the outcome of that litigation we currently offer our cable network on packaged basis in tier and in various case individually we have been involved in program access dispute at the fcc and may be subject to new complaint in the future must carry retransmission consentcable operator are required to carry without compensation programming transmitted by most local commercial and noncommercial broadcast television station an alternative to this must carry requirement local broadcast television station may choose to negotiate with the cable operator for retransmission consent under which the station give up it must carry right and instead seek to negotiate carriage agreement with the cable operator which frequently will involve payment to the station we currently pay certain local broadcast television station in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of the station broadcast programming to our video service customer and expect to continue to be subject to demand for increased payment and other concession from local broadcast television station failure to reach retransmission consent agreement with broadcaster could result in the loss of popular programming on our video service with respect to our broadcast television business every three year each local commercial broadcast television station must elect for each cable system in it dma either must carry or retransmission consent similar regulatory scheme applies to satellite provider for the three year period from january to december all of our owned nbc and telemundo local broadcast television station elected retransmission consent the next three year period will commence on january for which election were made by october all of our owned nbc and telemundo local broadcast television station elected retransmission consent although we have reached retransmission consent agreement with almost all mvpds in the past there can be no assurance that we will always be able to renew those agreement under favorable term or at all broadcast licensinglocal broadcast television station may be operated only in accordance with license issued by the fcc upon finding that the grant of the license will serve the public interest convenience and necessity the fcc grant broadcast television station license for specific period of time which may be renewed with or without condition the fcc renewed all of our broadcast television station license without condition during the last license renewal cycle the current television license renewal cycle began in although our license have been renewed in prior cycle there can be no assurance that we will always obtain renewal grant broadcast

framework applicable to our business in the united kingdom may be subject to greater uncertainty result of the united kingdom withdrawal from the european union and the end of the transition period on december with the possibility of greater divergence between the regulation of our business and that of our other european business over time we are not able to predict the extent of any such

highly competitive consumer driven and rapidly changing environment this environment is affected by government regulation economic strategic political and social condition consumer response to new and

materially from our forward looking statement result of any of such factor which could adversely affect our business result of operation or financial condition we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement item risk factorsrisks related to our business industry and operationsthe covid pandemic ha had and will likely continue to have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation the impact of covid and measure to prevent it spread across the globe have impacted our business in number of way while our cable communication result were strong in they were negatively affected by the significant deterioration in domestic economic condition and by cost associated with our support of customer connectivity people increasingly worked and learned remotely from home covid had material negative impact on nbcuniversal and sky result of operation during for example in late february we temporarily closed our theme park in japan and in mid march we temporarily closed our theme park in orlando and hollywood and although our park in orlando and japan reopened with limited capacity in june our park in hollywood remains closed we can not predict when the hollywood park will reopen if any reopened park will remain open or estimate attendance level at any of the park we expect the result of operation at our theme park will continue to be negatively impacted in the near to medium term the creation and availability of our film and television programming globally have been and will continue to be disrupted including result of the postponement or cancellation of sporting event such the professional soccer hockey baseball and basketball league and the olympics theatrical closure and the suspension of entertainment content production we expect any continued deterioration of global economic condition would result in lower advertising revenue and consumer spending across our business the impact of covid on our business also generally depends on the extent of restrictive governmental measure taken that affect day to day life and the length of time that such measure remain in place to respond to covid further deterioration of the global economy and the widespread availability of vaccine at this point it is impossible to predict such extent and duration and the degree to which our result of operation will continue to be affected covid may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risk set forth below annual report on form ktable of contentsour business operate in highly competitive and dynamic industry and our business and result of operation could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively all of our business operate in intensely competitive consumer driven rapidly changing environment and compete with growing number of company that provide broad range of communication product and service well entertainment news and information content to consumer some established dtc streaming and other ott service provider have become core competitor to our video service and more continue to enter the market at growing pace for example cable communication and sky high speed internet service compete primarily against wireline telecommunication company with fiber based network wireless telecommunication company offering internet service such and wireless broadband service certain municipality in the united state that own and operate their own broadband network and db provider competition for cable communication video service consists primarily of db provider phone company with fiber based network and increasingly dtc streaming and other ott service provider and device each of which typically offer feature pricing and packaging for service comparable to ours including bundled offer with high speed internet service sky face competition for it service from cable and telecommunication provider in it european market many of which offer customer bundled service which ha increased competition nbcuniversal and sky face substantial and increasing competition from provider of similar type of content well from other form of entertainment and recreational activity nbcuniversal and sky must compete to obtain talent content including sport programming and other resource required to operate their business this competition ha intensified dtc streaming and other ott service provider seek to develop high quality programming to attract viewer for more detailed description of the competition facing our business see item business and refer to the competition discussion within that section consolidation of or cooperation between our competitor including supplier and distributor of content may increase competition in all of these area may the emergence of additional competitor with significant resource and efficiency of scale who are competing with our business in all form of content distribution and production for example consolidation or cooperation between phone company which are also wireless distributor and content provider may allow competitor to offer free or lower cost streaming service potentially on an exclusive basis through unlimited data usage plan for internet or wireless phone service the ability of our business to compete effectively also depends on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituency including our customer consumer advertiser business partner employee investor and government authority our ability to compete will be negatively affected if we do not provide our customer with satisfactory customer experience while we continue to seek way to enhance the value of our business such by growing high speed internet service and business service and by investing in peacock the medium and entertainment landscape continues to rapidly evolve there can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiative in manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or operating margin or to compete successfully in the future there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against existing or new competitor or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our business change in consumer behavior driven by online video distribution platform for viewing content continue to adversely affect our business and challenge existing business model distribution platform for viewing and purchasing content over the internet have been and will likely continue to be developed that further increase the number of competitor that all our business face and challenge existing business model consumer increasingly turn to dtc streaming and other ott service the number of cable communication video customer and subscriber to nbcuniversal cable network decrease even cable communication high speed internet service become more important to consumer dtc streaming and other ott service have driven and will continue to drive change in consumer behavior consumer seek more control over when where and how they consume content and access communication service and how much they pay for such content for example in europe more of sky new video customer have recently subscribed and may continue to subscribe to sky dtc streaming service instead of it traditional dth video service although we have attempted to adapt our video service offering and enhance our high speed internet service for changing consumer behavior for example by deploying the and sky platform and flex which more easily aggregate content from linear traditional television channel and comcast annual report on form of contentsdtc streaming and other ott service for our customer and by launching peacock our dtc streaming service the continuing trend of content owner delivering their content directly to consumer over the internet rather than through or in addition to traditional video distribution service continues to disrupt traditional distribution business model the increase in dtc streaming and other ott service provider also ha significantly increased the number of entertainment choice available to consumer which ha intensified audience fragmentation and disaggregated the way that content traditionally ha been distributed and viewed by consumer nbcuniversal revenue relatedly may be negatively impacted traditional and virtual multichannel video provider which pay nbcuniversal fee based on their respective number of customer lose customer time shifting technology such dvr and on demand service reduce viewership which ha caused and likely will continue to cause audience rating decline for our programming channel consumer in many case have multiple option for viewing the same content for example content may be available through traditional linear platform on demand service or dtc streaming or ott service which may also result in audience rating decline reduced rating may adversely affect the price and amount of advertising that advertiser are willing to purchase from and the amount that we receive for distribution of our content in addition more programming provider offer their content directly to consumer they may reduce the quantity and quality of the programming they license to nbcuniversal or sky programming channel our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitor or change in consumer behavior including among younger consumer and shifting business model could have an adverse effect on our competitive position business and result of operation decline in advertiser expenditure or change in advertising market could negatively impact our business cable communication nbcuniversal and sky compete for the sale of advertising time with digital medium distributor other television network and station well with all other advertising platform such radio and print we derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising and decline in expenditure by advertiser including through traditional linear television distribution model could negatively impact our result of operation decline can be caused by the economic prospect of specific advertiser or industry increased competition for the leisure time of viewer such from social medium and video game audience fragmentation increased viewing of content through dtc streaming and other ott service provider regulatory intervention regarding where and when advertising may be placed or economic condition generally in addition advertiser have shifted portion of their total expenditure to digital medium and mobile offering which can deliver targeted advertising their willingness to purchase advertising from may be adversely affected by lower audience rating which many of nbcuniversal network and some of sky television channel have experienced and likely will continue to experience or from the level of popularity or perceived acceptance of peacock advertising sale and rate also are dependent on the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodology do not accurately reflect actual viewership level for example certain method of viewing content such through dtc streaming or other ott service provider or delayed viewing through dvr or on demand service might not be fully counted in audience measurement or may generate le if any revenue than traditional linear television distribution method which could have an adverse effect on our advertising revenue programming expense for our video service are increasing which could adversely affect cable communication video business we expect programming expense for our video service to continue to be the largest single expense item for our cable communication segment and to increase for the foreseeable future our programming expense may also increase we add programming to our video service or distribute existing programming to more of our customer or through additional delivery platform such on demand or streaming service additionally cable communication pay certain local broadcast television station in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to video service customer we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demand for payment and other concession from local broadcast television station these market factor may be exacerbated by increased consolidation in the medium industry which may further increase our programming expense if we are unable to raise our customer rate or otherwise offset programming cost increase through the sale of additional service cost management or other initiative the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our cable communication segment result of operation moreover our contract with content provider expire there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable term or at all in which case we may be unable to provide such content part of cable communication video service and our business and result of operation could be adversely affected nbcuniversal and sky success depends on consumer acceptance of their content and their business may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the cost to create or acquire content increase nbcuniversal and sky create and acquire medium and entertainment content the success of which depends substantially on consumer taste and preference that change in often unpredictable way the success of these business depends on our annual report on form ktable of contentsability to consistently create acquire market and distribute television programming filmed entertainment theme park attraction and other content that meet the changing preference of the broad domestic and international consumer market we have invested and will continue to invest substantial amount in our content including in the production of original content at nbcuniversal and sky in our film and for new theme park and theme park attraction before learning the extent to which they will earn consumer acceptance we also are incurring significant cost to develop peacock and there can be no assurance that consumer and advertiser will embrace this offering nbcuniversal and sky also obtain significant portion of their content from third party such movie studio television production company sport organization and other supplier sometimes on an exclusive basis competition for popular content particularly for sport programming is intense and we may have to increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitor for popular content we also may be unable to license popular third party content for nbcuniversal and sky programming channel if medium company determine that licensing the content to is not in their strategic best interest for example they may launch dtc streaming or other ott service for their owned content forgo license fee from and only provide their content directly to consumer or they may license their content on an exclusive basis to certain of our competitor or rival dtc streaming or other ott service provider entering into or renewing contract for such programming right or acquiring additional right may result in significantly increased cost particularly with respect to long term contract for sport programming right for nbcuniversal and sky our result of operation and cash flow over the term of contract depend on number of factor including the strength of the advertising market audience size the timing and amount of right payment and the ability of nbcuniversal to secure distribution from impose surcharge on or obtain carriage on multichannel video provider there can be no assurance that revenue from these contract will exceed our cost for the right well the other cost of producing and distributing the programming if our content not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or if we can not obtain or retain right to popular content on acceptable term or at all nbcuniversal and sky business may be adversely affected the loss of programming distribution and licensing agreement or the renewal of these agreement on le favorable term could adversely affect our business nbcuniversal cable network depend on their ability to secure and maintain distribution agreement with traditional and virtual multichannel video provider the number of subscriber to nbcuniversal cable network ha been and likely will continue to be reduced result of fewer subscriber to multichannel video provider sky also depends on it ability to secure and maintain wholesale distribution agreement for it television channel with multichannel video provider nbcuniversal and sky ability to renew these agreement on favorable term may be affected by recent industry consolidation and new participant entering the market for distribution of content on digital platform increasingly nbcuniversal and sky license their prior season and library content on third party distribution platform including to dtc streaming and other ott service provider if this programming doe not attract sufficient viewer these provider may not distribute nbcuniversal or sky programming and dtc streaming and other ott service provider may not license programming nbcuniversal or sky creates or license it at reduced rate in addition we expect not to license certain popular content and we may decide not to license additional owned popular content to third party so we may offer it exclusively through peacock which would result in foregone licensing revenue nbcuniversal broadcast television network depend on their ability to secure and maintain network affiliation agreement with third party local broadcast television station in the market where it doe not own the affiliated local broadcast television station in addition every three year each of it owned local broadcast television station must elect with respect to it retransmission by multichannel video provider within it dma either must carry status in which the distributor carriage of the station is mandatory and doe not generate any compensation for the local station or retransmission consent in which the station give up it right to mandatory carriage and instead seek to negotiate the term and condition of carriage with the distributor including the amount of compensation if any paid to the station by such distributor there can be no assurance that any of these agreement will be entered into or renewed in the future on acceptable term the inability to enter into or renew these agreement could reduce our revenue and the reach of our programming which could adversely affect nbcuniversal and sky business le favorable european telecommunication access regulation the loss of sky transmission access agreement with satellite or telecommunication provider or the renewal of these agreement on le favorable term could adversely affect sky business sky relies on various third party telecommunication provider to deliver it video high speed internet voice and wireless phone service to it customer for example sky relies on satellite transponder capacity leased from third party to provide most of it video service in addition under the current regulatory regime in the united kingdom ireland and italy sky comcast annual report on form of contentsaccesses network owned by third party telecommunication provider to offer it high speed internet and phone service in many case on regulated term including price if there is change in regulation in these market the regulated term could become le favorable moreover while sky receives wholesale fiber access on fair reasonable and non discriminatory term specific pricing term are not regulated result if sky is only able to enter into or renew it transmission agreement with satellite or telecommunication operator on le favorable term this would adversely affect sky ability to compete and if it is ultimately unable to do so on commercially viable term or if these operator were to terminate their agreement sky may be unable to deliver some of it service to customer in one or more of the country in which it operates which would adversely affect sky business and result of operation our business depend on using and protecting certain intellectual property right and on not infringing the intellectual property right of others we rely on our intellectual property such patent copyright trademark and trade secret well license and other agreement with our vendor and other third party to use various technology conduct our operation and sell our product and service legal challenge to our intellectual property right and claim of intellectual property infringement by third party could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreement on unfavorable term incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question from importing into the united state or other jurisdiction in which we operate hardware or software that us such intellectual property or from the continuation of our business currently conducted we may need to change our business practice if any of these event occur which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our result of operation even if we believe any such challenge or claim are without merit they can be time consuming and costly to defend and divert management attention and resource away from our business moreover if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain license from our vendor and other third party on reasonable term our business could be adversely affected in addition intellectual property constitutes significant part of the value of nbcuniversal and sky business and their success is highly dependent on protecting the intellectual property right of the content they create or acquire against third party misappropriation reproduction or infringement the unauthorized reproduction distribution or display of copyrighted material negatively affect our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content well from the sale of advertising in connection with our content and increase our cost due to our active enforcement of our intellectual property right piracy and other unauthorized us of content are made easier and the enforcement of intellectual property right more challenging by technological advance that allow the conversion of programming film and other content into digital format which facilitates the creation transmission and sharing of high quality unauthorized copy in particular piracy of programming and film through unauthorized distribution platform continues to present challenge for nbcuniversal cable network broadcast television and filmed entertainment business and certain illegal online entity may stream our broadcast television content online without our consent and without paying any compensation to it also present similar challenge for sky business including result of illegal retransmission of sport event while piracy is challenge in the united state it is particularly prevalent in many part of the world that lack developed copyright law effective enforcement of copyright law and technical protective measure like those in effect in the united state if any or international law intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property right are repealed or weakened or are not adequately enforced or if the legal system fails to adapt to new technology that facilitate piracy we may be unable to effectively protect our right the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our cost of enforcing our right may increase we may be unable to obtain necessary hardware software and operational support we depend on third party vendor to supply with significant amount of the hardware software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our product and service some of these vendor represent our primary source of supply or grant the right to incorporate their intellectual property into some of our hardware and software product while we actively monitor the operation and financial condition of key vendor in an attempt to detect any potential difficulty there can be no assurance that we would timely identify any operating or financial difficulty associated with these vendor or that we could effectively mitigate our risk with respect to any such difficulty if any of these vendor experience operating or financial difficulty if our demand exceeds their capacity or if they breach or terminate their agreement with or are otherwise unable to meet our specification or provide the equipment product or service we need in timely manner or at all or at reasonable price our ability to provide some product or service may be adversely affected and we may incur additional cost weak economic condition may have negative impact on our business substantial portion of our revenue come from customer whose spending pattern may be affected by prevailing economic condition weak economic condition in the united state or globally could adversely affect demand for any of our product and service and have negative impact on our result of operation for example weak economic condition will likely impact our customer discretionary spending and result they may reduce the level of service to which they subscribe or may annual report on form ktable of contentsdiscontinue subscribing to one or more of cable communication or sky service this risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive service such certain dtc streaming and other ott service or substitute service for high speed internet and voice service such mobile phone and wi fi network weak economic condition also negatively impact our advertising revenue the performance of our film and home entertainment release and attendance and spending in our theme park in particular the success of our theme park and theatrical release largely depend on consumer demand for out of home entertainment experience which may be limited by weakened economic condition well natural disaster infectious disease outbreak such covid terrorist attack or other similar event weak economic condition and disruption in the global financial market may also have an impact on the ability of third party to satisfy their obligation to or increase our exposure to currency fluctuation in country where we operate in addition in connection with our acquisition of sky we incurred and assumed significant amount of additional debt if our business are negatively impacted by weak economic condition we may not be able to reduce the amount of our debt outstanding quickly expected further significant increase in interest rate or disruption in the global financial market may affect our ability to obtain financing or to refinance existing debt on acceptable term if at all and could increase the cost of our borrowing acquisition and other strategic initiative present many risk and we may not realize the financial and strategic goal that we had contemplated from time to time we make acquisition and investment and may pursue other strategic initiative such peacock in connection with such acquisition and strategic initiative we may incur significant or unanticipated expense fail to realize anticipated benefit and synergy have difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business disrupt relationship with current and new employee customer and vendor incur significant debt divert the attention of management from our current operation or have to delay or not proceed with announced transaction or initiative additionally federal regulatory agency such the fcc or doj or international regulator may impose restriction on the operation of our business result of our seeking regulatory approval for any significant acquisition and strategic initiative or may dissuade from pursuing certain transaction the occurrence of any of these event could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation we face risk relating to business internationally that could adversely affect our business we operate our business worldwide there are risk inherent in doing business internationally including global financial market turmoil economic volatility and global economic slowdown currency exchange rate fluctuation and inflationary pressure political risk the requirement of local law and custom relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising import or export restriction tariff sanction and trade regulation difficulty in developing staffing and managing foreign operation issue related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor law and regulation and potentially adverse tax development additionally although we employ foreign currency derivative instrument to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk including the british pound and euro the use of such derivative instrument may not be sufficient to mitigate exchange rate fluctuation sky business in particular are also subject to risk relating to uncertainty and effect of the united kingdom withdrawal from the european union referred to brexit including financial legal tax and trade implication in addition doing business internationally subject to risk relating to political or social unrest well corruption and government regulation including law such the foreign corrupt practice act and the bribery act that impose stringent requirement on how we conduct our foreign operation if any of these event occur or our conduct doe not comply with such law and regulation our business may be adversely affected our business depend on keeping pace with technological development our success is to large extent dependent on our ability to acquire develop adopt and leverage new and existing technology and our competitor use of certain type of technology and equipment may provide them with competitive advantage new technology can materially impact our business in number of way including affecting the demand for our product the distribution method of our product and content to our customer the way in which our customer can purchase and view our content and the growth of distribution platform available to advertiser for example current and new wireless internet technology such and wireless broadband service continue to evolve rapidly and may allow for greater speed and reliability in addition some company and municipality are building advanced fiber based network that provide very fast internet access speed we expect advance in communication technology to continue to occur in the future if we choose technology or equipment that is not effective or attractive to consumer that employed by our competitor if we fail to employ technology desired by consumer before our competitor do so or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiative our business and result of operation could be adversely affected we also will continue to incur additional cost we execute our technology initiative such the deployment of flex and sky set top box wireless gateway and the development of peacock there can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiative in manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or to successfully compete in the future we also may generate le revenue or incur increased cost if change in our competitor product offering require that we offer certain service or enhancement at lower

security breach could lead to litigation or could cause regulator in the united state and internationally to impose fine or other remedy for failure to comply with relevant customer privacy rule the risk of system related event and security breach occurring continues to intensify in many of our business and our business may be at disproportionately heightened risk of these event occurring due to the nature of our business and because we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form in the ordinary course of our business there are frequent attempt by third party to cause such system related event and security breach and to identify our security architecture or system design vulnerability while we develop and maintain system and operate an extensive security program seeking to prevent system related event and security breach from occurring the development maintenance and operation of these system and program is costly and requires ongoing

widespread availability of vaccine cable communication our distribution network performed well under the stress of increased traffic and peak usage driven by increased video streaming gaming and

addition the number of such customer decreased in the third and fourth quarter some of these customer either began paying for service resulting in customer net addition or disconnected and no longer

canceled match and reduced schedule certain of our programming distribution agreement with regional sport network include contractual adjustment provision if minimum number of sporting event doe not occur our programming expense were reduced result of these provision and our revenue wa negatively impacted in similar amount result of adjustment that we passed through to our customer in and continue to pas through in the first quarter of the deterioration of economic condition and increased economic uncertainty resulting from covid have resulted in reduced demand for certain of our residential and business service and reduced spending from advertiser which have had and while we have seen some improvement over the course of likely will continue to have negative impact on our

our bad debt expense nbcuniversal the temporary closure of all of our theme park had the most significant impact on our revenue and adjusted ebitda for the year ended december on consolidated basis our park in orlando and japan reopened with limited capacity in june while our park in hollywood remains closed we expect the result of operation at our theme park will continue to be negatively impacted in the near to medium term and we can not predict with certainty when the hollywood park will reopen if any reopened park will remain open or the level of attendance at any reopened park in addition although we currently expect that universal beijing resort will open in we have delayed certain construction project including the development of the epic universe theme park in orlando the deterioration of economic condition caused by covid resulted in significant reduction in advertising spend by our customer in the cable network and broadcast television segment and while we have seen some improvement over the course of we expect this trend to continue over the near to medium term there ha also been and likely will continue to be an acceleration of subscriber loss at our network we incurred cost in associated with compensating personnel who were unable to work due to the closing or suspension of operation due to covid primarily during the first half of the year including at our

agreement with multichannel video provider require contractual adjustment if minimum number of sporting event doe not occur our distribution revenue wa negatively impacted result of credit accrued relating to these provision and the programming cost that we recognized the remaining event occurred were also impacted in addition there have been and there may be in the future delay to the start of the current or upcoming season for certain professional sport league when or the extent to which sporting event will occur in will impact the timing and potentially the amount of revenue and expense recognition in addition the tokyo olympics have been postponed from the third quarter of to the third quarter of resulting in corresponding delay of the associated revenue and cost the creation and

production operation have resumed at limited capacity additionally with the temporary closure of many movie theater worldwide we have delayed or altered the theatrical distribution strategy for

expect result of operation in our filmed entertainment segment to continue to be negatively impacted over the near to medium term result of covid sky direct to consumer revenue ha been negatively impacted result of lower sport subscription revenue due to the disruption of professional sport season and future period may be negatively impacted result of the reopening plan and the extent of

for certain sport including european soccer result significant cost associated with broadcasting these program were not recognized in covid continues to result in uncertainty in the ultimate timing of

suspended certain sale channel due to covid which negatively impacted net customer addition and revenue in the first half of our sale channel generally resumed operation in june covid ha resulted in the deterioration of economic condition and increased economic uncertainty in europe intensifying wa an already deteriorating economic and advertising environment these condition negatively impacted

there is increased risk associated with collection on our outstanding receivables and we have incurred and may continue to incur increase in our bad debt expense we have implemented and will continue to implement cost saving initiative across our business that have impacted and will continue to impact our result of operation certain cost incurred by our business in response to covid including severance are presented in corporate and other our business implemented separate cost saving initiative with the most significant relating to severance at nbcuniversal in connection with the

related to nbcuniversal employee severance are expected to be completed in nbcuniversal employee related cost saving will be realized in operating cost and expense primarily beginning in and portion of these cost saving may be reallocated to investment in content and other strategic initiative global financial market have been volatile and domestic and global economic condition continue to show sign of material weakness at this point it is impossible to predict the extent and duration of these and any other impact of covid to our business or the degree to which demand for our product and service or supply of key input to those product and service will be affected this uncertainty make it challenging for management to estimate with precision the future performance of our business of

continue to evaluate the impact of covid on our business including the impact of overall economic condition which could result in the recognition of an impairment charge in the future liquidityalthough negatively impacted by the effect of covid we expect that our business will continue to generate significant cash flow from operating activity and we believe that these cash flow together with our existing cash cash equivalent and investment available borrowing under our existing credit facility and our ability to obtain future external financing will be sufficient for to meet our current and long term liquidity and capital requirement in we issued billion of long term debt the proceeds of which were used to repay existing indebtedness and increase cash on our balance sheet in order to bolster liquidity and strengthen our financial position result of the increased uncertainty related to the duration and scope of the covid pandemic we also took action to conservatively

recent accounting pronouncement including the impact of the adoption of the updated accounting guidance related to film and television cost and credit loss annual report on form ktable of contentscritical accounting judgment and estimatesthe preparation of our consolidated financial statement requires to make estimate that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense and the related disclosure of contingent asset and contingent liability we base our judgment on our historical experience and on various other assumption that we believe are reasonable under the circumstance the result of which form the basis for making estimate about the carrying value of asset and liability that are not readily apparent from other source actual result may differ from these estimate under different assumption or condition we believe our judgment and related estimate associated with the valuation and impairment testing of goodwill and cable franchise right and the accounting for film and television cost are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statement management ha discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgment and estimate with the audit committee of our board of director and the audit committee ha reviewed the related disclosure below see also note and valuation and impairment testing of goodwill and cable franchise rightswe ass the recoverability of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset including cable franchise right annually of july or more frequently whenever event or substantive change in circumstance indicate that the asset might be impaired the assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factor to determine whether the existence of event or circumstance lead to determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit or an indefinite lived intangible asset is le than it carrying amount quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment result in more likely than not determination or if qualitative assessment is not performed goodwillgoodwill result from business combination and represents the excess amount of the consideration paid over the identifiable asset and liability recorded in the acquisition we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and have concluded that our reporting unit are generally the same our reportable segment we evaluate the determination of our reporting unit periodically or whenever event or substantive change in circumstance occur when performing quantitative assessment we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit primarily based on discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment including market participant estimate of future cash flow expected to be generated by the business and the selection of discount rate when analyzing the fair value indicated under discounted cash flow model we also consider multiple of adjusted ebitda generated by the underlying asset current market transaction and profitability information we performed qualitative assessment in for goodwill in our cable communication and nbcuniversal segment the qualitative assessment considered that the estimated fair value of these reporting unit substantially exceeded their carrying value at the time of our previous quantitative assessment in change in projected future cash flow recent market transaction and overall macroeconomic condition including the effect of covid discount rate and change in our market capitalization based on these assessment we concluded that it wa more likely than not that the estimated fair value of our reporting unit were higher than their carrying value and that the performance of quantitative impairment test wa not required we performed quantitative assessment in for goodwill in our sky segment and the estimated fair value of the reporting unit wa higher than the carrying value asset and liability resulting from business combination are initially recorded at fair value and the risk of goodwill impairment is reduced the value of the business in reporting unit increase and the carrying value of the reporting unit decrease due to the amortization of the historical cost of acquired long lived asset over time given the goodwill in our sky segment resulted from our recent acquisition of sky in the fourth quarter of the fair value is in close proximity to the carrying value of the sky reporting unit change in market condition law and regulation and key assumption made in future quantitative assessment including expected cash flow competitive factor and discount rate could negatively impact the result of future impairment testing and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge cable franchise rightsour cable franchise right asset result from agreement we have with state and local government that allow to construct and operate cable business within specified geographic area the value of franchise is derived from the economic benefit we receive from the right to solicit new customer and to market additional service in particular service area the amount we record for cable franchise right are primarily result of cable system acquisition typically when we acquire cable system the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise right often these cable system acquisition include multiple franchise area we currently serve approximately franchise area in the united state comcast annual report on form of contentswe have concluded that our cable franchise right have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factor which limit the period over which these right will contribute to our cash flow accordingly we do not amortize our cable franchise right for purpose of impairment testing we have grouped the recorded value of our various cable franchise right into our three cable communication division or unit of account we evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level when performing quantitative assessment we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise right primarily based on discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment including the estimate of future cash flow and the selection of discount rate when analyzing the fair value indicated under the discounted cash flow model we also consider multiple of adjusted ebitda generated by the underlying asset current market transaction and profitability information in we performed qualitative assessment of our cable franchise right at the time of our previous quantitative assessment in the estimated fair value of our franchise right substantially exceeded their carrying value we also considered various factor that would affect the estimated fair value of our cable franchise right in our qualitative assessment including change in our projected future cash flow associated with our cable communication segment recent market transaction and overall macroeconomic condition including the effect of covid discount rate and change in our market capitalization based on this assessment we concluded that it wa more likely than not that the estimated fair value of our cable franchise right were higher than the carrying value and that the performance of quantitative impairment test wa not required change in market condition law and regulation and key assumption made in future quantitative assessment including expected cash flow competitive factor and discount rate could negatively impact the result of future impairment testing and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge film and television contentwe capitalize cost for owned film and television content including direct cost production overhead print cost development cost and interest well acquired library we have determined that the predominant monetization strategy for the substantial majority of our content is on an individual basis amortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued cost associated with participation and residual payment are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method which recognizes the cost in the same ratio the associated ultimate revenue our estimate of ultimate revenue for film generally include revenue from all source that are expected to be earned within year from the date of film initial release these estimate are based on the distribution strategy and historical performance of similar content well factor unique to the content the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue for film intended for theatrical release is the film theatrical performance subsequent revenue from the licensing and sale of film ha historically exhibited high correlation to it theatrical performance upon film release our estimate of revenue from succeeding market including from content licensing across multiple platform and home entertainment sale are revised based on historical relationship and an analysis of current market trend with respect to television series or other owned television programming the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue is whether the series can be successfully licensed beyond it initial license window initial estimate of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue attributed to the initial license window once it is determined that television series or other owned television programming can be licensed beyond the initial license window revenue estimate for these additional window or platform such and international syndication home entertainment and other distribution platform are included in ultimate revenue revenue estimate for produced episode include revenue expected to be earned within year of delivery of the initial episode or if still in production year from the delivery of the most recent episode if later we capitalize the cost of licensed content when the license period begin the content is made available for use and the cost of the license are known licensed content is amortized the associated program are broadcast we recognize the cost of multiyear live event sport right the right are utilized over the contract term based on estimated relative value estimated relative value is generally based on the ratio of the current period revenue to the estimated ultimate revenue or the term of the contract our estimate of ultimate revenue for sport right include estimate of advertising and subscriber receiving or viewing the broadcast over the term of the agreement annual report on form ktable of contentscapitalized film and television cost are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering event are identified the substantial majority of our owned content is evaluated for impairment on an individual title basis licensed content that is not part of film group is tested for impairment primarily on channel network or platform basis with the exception of our broadcast network and owned local broadcast television station which are tested on daypart basis sport right are accounted for executory contract and are not subject to impairment when performing an impairment
