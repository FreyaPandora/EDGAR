weight the mix of service purchased by our customer the price we obtain for our service primarily measured by yield revenue per package or pound or revenue per hundredweight for ltl freight shipment our ability to manage our cost structure capital expenditure and operating expense to match shifting volume level and the timing and amount of fluctuation in fuel price and our ability to recover incremental fuel cost through our fuel surcharge the majority of our operating expense are directly impacted by revenue and volume level accordingly we expect these operating expense to fluctuate on year over year basis consistent with the change in revenue and volume therefore the discussion of operating expense caption focus on the key driver and trend impacting expense other than change in

overview section salary and benefit increased in primarily due to higher incentive compensation cost and the full reinstatement of company matching contribution effective january purchased transportation cost increased in due to volume growth and higher fuel surcharge at fedex ground cost associated with the expansion of our freight forwarding business at fedex trade network and higher utilization of third party transportation provider in international location primarily due to business acquisition at fedex express the following graph for our transportation segment show our average

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk section of this md have timing lag and are designed to pas through the price of fuel not included in our base shipping rate to our customer based on static analysis of the impact to operating income of year over year change in fuel price compared change in fuel surcharge fuel surcharge significantly exceeded incremental fuel cost in if fuel price remain at current level that effect is expected to reverse in our analysis considers the estimated impact of the reduction in fuel surcharge included in the base rate charged for fedex express and fedex ground service however this analysis doe not consider the negative effect that fuel surcharge level may have on our business including reduced demand and shift by our customer to lower yielding service while fluctuation in fuel surcharge rate can be significant from period to period fuel surcharge represent one of the many individual component of our pricing structure that impact our overall revenue and yield additional component include the mix of service sold the base price and extra service charge we obtain for these service and the level of pricing discount offered in order to provide information about the impact of fuel surcharge on the trend in revenue and yield growth we have included the comparative fuel surcharge rate in effect for and in the accompanying discussion of each of our transportation segment in operating income increased primarily due to yield and volume increase across all our transportation segment higher compensation and benefit including retirement plan and medical cost and increased maintenance and repair expense had negative impact on our performance for cost related to the combination of our fedex freight and fedex national ltl operation also negatively impacted our result by million unusually severe weather in the second half of caused widespread disruption to our network which led to lost revenue and drove higher purchased transportation salary and wage and other operational cost additionally million reserve associated with an adverse jury decision in the ata airline lawsuit against fedex express wa recognized in salary and employee benefit increased in due to the reinstatement of merit salary increase increase in pension and medical cost and the reinstatement of full company matching contribution effective january purchased transportation increased in due to volume growth higher fuel surcharge and higher rate paid to our independent contractor at fedex ground well cost associated with the expansion of our freight forwarding business at fedex trade network maintenance and repair expense increased in primarily due to an increase in maintenance event result of timing and higher utilization of our fleet driven by increased volume other operating expense increased primarily due to volume and weather related expense fuel expense increased during primarily due to increase in the average price per gallon of fuel and fuel consumption driven by volume increase based on static analysis of the net impact of year over year change in fuel price compared to year over year change in fuel surcharge fuel had positive impact on operating income in predominantly at fedex express other income and expense interest expense decreased million in due to debt maturity an increase in capitalized interest related to the timing of progress payment on aircraft purchase and lower financing fee interest expense increased million in due to decrease in capitalized interest related to timing of construction project and progress payment on aircraft purchase income tax our effective tax rate wa in in and in our rate wa lower than our rate primarily due to favorable audit development the rate wa lower than our rate primarily due to increased permanently reinvested foreign earnings and lower state rate driven by favorable audit and legislative development our permanent reinvestment

million at the end of table of content our current federal income tax expense in and were significantly reduced by accelerated depreciation deduction we claimed under provision of the tax relief and the small business job act of the american recovery and reinvestment tax act of and the economic stimulus act of those act designed to stimulate new business investment in the accelerated our depreciation deduction for new qualifying investment such our new boeing freighter aircraft these are timing benefit only in that the depreciation would have otherwise been recognized in later year the component of the provision for federal income tax for the year ended may were follows in million current deferred total federal provision for we expect our effective tax rate to be between and the actual rate however will depend on number of factor including the amount and source of operating income we also expect our current federal income tax expense will increase in possibly significantly due to lower accelerated depreciation benefit than in prior year additional information on income tax including our effective tax rate reconciliation and liability for uncertain tax position can be found in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement business acquisition during we continued to expand our fedex express international network on july we completed our acquisition of servicios nacionales mupa de multipack mexican domestic express package delivery company for million in cash from operation last year fedex express completed the acquisition of the indian logistics distribution and express business of afl pvt ltd and it affiliate unifreight india pvt ltd for million in cash on february the financial result of these acquired business are included in the fedex express segment from the date of acquisition and were not material individually or in the aggregate to our result of operation or financial condition substantially all of the purchase price wa allocated to goodwill which wa entirely attributed to our fedex express reporting unit subsequent to year end we completed the following acquisition opek sp polish domestic express package delivery company for million in cash from operation on june tatex french express transportation company for million in cash from operation on july rapidão cometa logística transportes brazilian transportation and logistics company for million in cash from operation on july based on the timing of the completion of these acquisition in relation to the date of issuance of the financial statement the initial purchase price accounting wa not completed for these acquisition the financial result of these acquired business will be included in the fedex express segment from the date of acquisition and will be immaterial to our result these acquisition will give more robust transportation network within these country and added capability in these important global market table of content outlook we anticipate revenue and earnings growth in despite only modest growth in the global economy we believe domestic and global economic condition will be impacted by the european debt crisis slowing growth in asia and the uncertainty these issue create on the global economy and the demand for our service these weaker global economic condition have driven shift by our customer from premium service to our deferred service and we expect that trend to continue in our anticipated earnings growth in is predicated on continued improvement in profitability at our fedex freight segment from yield growth and efficiency improvement and the sustained strong performance of our fedex ground segment international revenue growth and network efficiency improvement at fedex express should also contribute to our earnings growth in however significant cost headwind in pension expense will hamper earnings growth in historically low discount rate at our may measurement date will increase these cost by approximately million during we will continue to evaluate action and opportunity to reduce cost improve efficiency and adjust our network to match anticipated demand initial action were taken in we made the decision to retire aircraft and related engine at fedex express to better align the domestic air network capacity to match current and anticipated shipment volume in addition we remain focused on modernizing our aircraft fleet at fedex express by adding newer aircraft that are more reliable fuel efficient and technologically advanced and retiring older le efficient aircraft result of these effort fedex express is shortening the depreciable life of the following aircraft and related engine additional boeing additional airbus four boeing and one boeing this will accelerate the retirement of these aircraft to align with the delivery schedule for replacement boeing freighter and boeing aircraft the accelerated depreciation on these aircraft is expected to total million in with partial offset from the avoidance of depreciation related to the aircraft retirement described in the impairment and other charge section above fedex express is also developing an operating and cost structure plan during to further improve it operational efficiency our capital expenditure for are expected to decrease to approximately billion with fewer aircraft delivery in we will continue to evaluate our investment in critical long term strategic project to ensure our capital expenditure generate high return on investment and are balanced with our outlook for global economic condition on june fedex express entered into supplemental agreement to purchase nine additional aircraft exercised ten option available under the december agreement and purchased the right to additional option in conjunction with the supplemental agreement to purchase aircraft fedex express converted four aircraft delivery to equivalent purchase value for aircraft purchased under the supplemental agreement for additional detail on key capital project refer to the capital resource and liquidity outlook section of this md our outlook is dependent upon stable pricing environment for fuel volatility in fuel price impact our fuel surcharge level fuel expense and demand for our service historically our fuel surcharge have largely offset incremental fuel cost however volatility in fuel cost may impact earnings because adjustment to our fuel surcharge lag change in actual fuel price paid therefore the trailing impact of adjustment to our fuel surcharge can significantly affect our earnings either positively or negatively in the short term described in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement and the independent contractor matter section of our fedex ground segment md we are involved in number of lawsuit and other proceeding that challenge the status of fedex ground owner operator independent contractor fedex ground anticipates continuing change to it relationship with it contractor the nature timing and amount of any change are dependent on the outcome of numerous future event we can not reasonably estimate the potential impact of any such change or meaningful range of potential outcome although they could be material however we do not believe that any such change will impair our ability to operate and profitably grow our fedex ground business table of content see risk factor for discussion of these and other potential risk and uncertainty that could materially affect our future performance seasonality of business our business are cyclical in nature seasonal fluctuation affect volume revenue and earnings historically the express package business experience an increase in volume in late november and december international business particularly in the asia to market peak in october and november in advance of the holiday sale season our first and third fiscal quarter because they are summer vacation and post winter holiday season have historically experienced lower volume relative to other period normally the fall is the busiest shipping period for fedex ground while late december june and july are the slowest period for fedex freight the spring and fall are the busiest period and the latter part of december january and february are the slowest period for fedex office the summer month are normally the slowest period shipment level operating cost and earnings for each of our company can also be adversely affected by inclement weather particularly the impact of severe winter weather in our third fiscal quarter new accounting guidance new accounting rule and disclosure requirement can significantly impact our reported result and the comparability of our financial statement during our fiscal year the financial accounting standard board issued new guidance to make the presentation of item within other comprehensive income oci more prominent the new standard will require company to present item of net income item of oci and total comprehensive income in one continuous statement or two separate consecutive statement and company will no longer be allowed to present item of oci in the statement of

during the second half of ltl shipment year over year comparison improved sequentially in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter due to enhanced service level strong customer satisfaction from our service offering and the impact of severe weather in the prior year table of content fedex freight segment revenue increased in due to higher ltl yield and average daily ltl shipment ltl yield increased in due to our yield management program and higher fuel surcharge under these program ltl yield increased sequentially in each of the previous four quarter while average daily ltl shipment fell during the second half of for the full year average daily ltl shipment increased in primarily due to volume increase during the first half of resulting from the impact of discounted pricing in

fuel surcharge ranged follows for the year ended may low high weighted average on june fedex freight announced general rate increase of for ltl shipment to be effective on july in june fedex freight increased the fuel surcharge rate to maximum of percentage point above previous level in september we implemented general rate increase of for ltl shipment in november we implemented general rate increase for ltl shipment fedex freight segment operating income loss in the fedex freight segment operating income increased significantly result of higher fuel surcharge yield growth and ongoing improvement in operational efficiency due to the combination of our fedex freight and fedex national ltl operation in see below additionally the fedex freight segment result benefited from milder winter weather while our result were negatively impacted by unusually severe winter weather purchased transportation cost increased in due to higher rate and the increased utilization of rail partially offset by lower cost per mile due to our ability to optimize mode of transportation while meeting service standard fuel cost increased in due to higher average price per gallon of diesel fuel partially offset by the increased utilization of rail based on static analysis of the net impact of year over year change in fuel price compared to year over year change in fuel surcharge fuel had positive impact to operating income in depreciation and amortization expense decreased in primarily due to accelerated depreciation in associated with the combination of our ltl operation the

transportation cost increased in due to higher shipment volume and higher rate fuel cost increased in due to higher average price per gallon of diesel fuel and increased fuel consumption result of higher shipment volume based on static analysis of the net impact of year over year change in fuel price compared to year over year change in fuel surcharge fuel had slightly table of content favorable impact to operating income in maintenance and repair expense increased in due to higher volume and the aging of our fleet also higher intercompany charge in reflect the transfer of sale and

well progress payment toward future aircraft delivery at fedex express for we anticipate making required contribution to our pension plan totaling approximately million our pension plan have ample fund to meet expected benefit payment we have several aircraft modernization program underway which are supported by the purchase of and aircraft these aircraft are significantly more fuel efficient per unit than the aircraft type previously utilized and these expenditure are necessary to achieve significant long term operating saving and to support projected long term international volume growth our ability to delay the timing of these aircraft related expenditure is limited without incurring significant cost to modify existing purchase agreement we will have benefit from the tax expensing

statement in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state requires management to make significant judgment and estimate to develop amount reflected and disclosed in the financial statement in many case there are alternative policy or estimation technique that could be used we maintain thorough process to review the application of our accounting policy and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimate that are required to prepare the financial statement of complex global corporation however even under optimal circumstance estimate routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstance and new or better information the estimate discussed below include the financial statement element that are either the most judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policy and are material to our financial statement management ha discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of director and with our independent registered public accounting firm retirement plan overview we sponsor program that provide retirement benefit to most of our employee these program include defined benefit pension plan defined contribution plan and postretirement healthcare plan pension benefit for most employee are accrued under cash balance formula we call the portable pension account under the portable pension account the retirement benefit is expressed dollar amount in notional account that grows with annual credit based on pay age and year of credited service and interest on the notional account balance the portable pension account benefit table of content is payable lump sum or an annuity at retirement at the election of the employee the plan interest credit rate varies from year to year based on treasury index and corporate bond rate prior to certain employee earned benefit using traditional pension formula based on average earnings and year of service benefit under this formula were capped on may for most employee the current rule for pension accounting are complex and can produce tremendous volatility in our result financial condition and liquidity our pension expense is primarily function of the value of our plan asset and the discount rate used to measure our pension liability at single point in time at the end of our fiscal year the measurement date both of these factor are significantly influenced by the stock and bond market which in recent year have experienced substantial volatility in addition to expense volatility we are required to record year end adjustment to our balance sheet on an annual basis for the net funded status of our pension and postretirement healthcare plan these adjustment have fluctuated significantly over the past several year and like our pension expense are result of the discount rate and value of our plan asset at the measurement date the funded status of our plan also impact our liquidity current funding law require increasingly aggressive funding level for our pension plan however the cash funding rule operate under completely different set of assumption and standard than those used for financial reporting purpose so our actual cash funding requirement can differ materially from our reported funded status our retirement plan cost is included in the salary and employee benefit caption in our consolidated income statement summary of our retirement plan cost over the past three year is follows in million domestic and international pension plan domestic and international defined contribution plan postretirement healthcare plan total retirement plan cost increased million in primarily due to higher expense for our plan due to the full restoration of company matching contribution on january total retirement plan cost increased million in driven by lower discount rate used to measure our benefit obligation at our may measurement date additionally we incurred higher expense for our plan in due to the partial reinstatement of company matching contribution on january previously suspended in february our retirement plan cost are expected to increase significantly in historically low discount rate at may will increase our expense by over million of which million is attributable to pension plan expense pension cost the accounting for pension and postretirement healthcare plan includes numerous assumption including the discount rate and expected long term investment return on plan asset these assumption most significantly impact our pension plan the component of pension cost for all pension plan are follows in million service cost interest cost expected return on plan asset recognized actuarial loss gain and other net periodic benefit cost table of content following is discussion of the key estimate we consider in determining our pension cost discount rate this is the interest rate used to discount the estimated future benefit payment that have been accrued to date the projected benefit obligation or pbo to their net present value and to determine the succeeding year pension expense the discount rate is determined each year at the plan measurement date decrease in the discount rate increase pension expense the discount rate affect the pbo and pension expense based on the measurement date described below xxxx xxx xxxx xxx measurementdate discountrate amount determined by measurement date anddiscount rate pbo and expense pbo and expense pbo and expense pbo and expense we determine the discount rate with the assistance of actuary who calculate the yield on theoretical portfolio of high grade corporate bond rated aa or better with cash flow designed to match our expected benefit payment in future year in developing this theoretical portfolio we select bond that match cash flow to benefit payment limit our concentration by industry and issuer and apply screening criterion to ensure bond with call feature have low probability of being called to the extent scheduled bond proceeds exceed the estimated benefit payment in given period the calculation assumes those excess proceeds are reinvested at one year forward rate the discount rate assumption is highly sensitive the following table illustrates for our largest tax qualified domestic pension plan sensitivity in million effect on effect on one basis point change in discount rate at our may measurement date basis point increase in the discount rate would have decreased our pbo by approximately billion and basis point decrease in the discount rate would have increased our pbo by approximately billion from to the discount rate used to value our liability ha declined by over basis point which increased the valuation of our liability by over billion plan asset the estimated average rate of return on plan asset is long term forward looking assumption that also materially affect our pension cost it is required to be the expected future long term rate of earnings on plan asset our pension plan asset are invested primarily in listed security and our pension plan hold only minimal investment in fedex common stock that is entirely at the discretion of third party pension fund investment manager part of our strategy to manage future pension cost and net funded status volatility we have transitioned to liability driven investment strategy with greater concentration of fixed income security to better align plan asset with liability table of content establishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension asset is judgmental matter which we review on an annual basis and revise appropriate management considers the following factor in determining this assumption the duration of our pension plan liability which drive the investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan asset the type of investment class in which we invest our pension plan asset and the expected compound geometric return we can reasonably expect those investment class to earn over time and the investment return we can reasonably expect our investment management program to achieve in excess of the return we could expect if investment were made strictly in indexed fund the following table summarizes our current asset allocation strategy dollar in million plan asset at measurement date asset class actual actual target actual actual target domestic equity international equity private equity total equity fixed income security cash and other we have assumed an compound geometric long term rate of return on our pension plan asset for and the actual return during each of the last three fiscal year have exceeded that long term assumption the actual historical return on our pension plan asset calculated on compound geometric basis wa approximately net of investment manager fee for the year period ended may and net of investment manager fee for the year period ended may one basis point change in our expected return on plan asset impact our pension expense by million pension expense is also affected by the accounting policy used to determine the value of plan asset at the measurement date we use calculated value method to determine the value of plan asset which help mitigate short term volatility in market performance both increase and decrease by amortizing certain actuarial gain or loss over period no longer than four year another method used in practice applies the market value of plan asset at the measurement date for purpose of valuing plan asset for determining pension expense the calculated value method resulted in the same value the market value table of content funded status following is information concerning the funded status of our pension plan of may in million

discount rate those loss are subject to amortization over future year and may be reflected in future income statement unless they are recovered at may we recorded decrease to equity through oci of million net of tax to reflect unrealized actuarial loss during related to decline in the discount rate the funding requirement for our pension plan are governed by the pension protection act of which ha aggressive funding requirement in order to avoid benefit payment restriction that become effective if the funded status determined under internal revenue service rule fall below at the beginning of plan year all of our pension plan have funded status level in excess of and our plan remain adequately funded to provide benefit to our employee they come due additionally current benefit payment are nominal compared to our total plan asset benefit payment for our pension plan for were approximately million or of plan asset during we made million in contribution to our pension plan including million in voluntary contribution over the past several year we have made voluntary contribution to our pension plan in excess of the minimum required contribution amount contributed in excess of the minimum required result in credit balance for funding purpose that can be used to meet minimum contribution requirement in future year for we anticipate making required contribution to our pension plan totaling approximately million cumulative unrecognized actuarial loss were billion through may compared to billion through may these unrecognized loss reflect change in the discount rate and difference between expected and actual asset return which are being amortized over future period these unrecognized loss may be recovered in future period through actuarial gain however unless they are below corridor amount these unrecognized actuarial loss are required to be amortized and recognized in future period our pension expense includes amortization of these actuarial loss of million in million in and million in table of content self insurance accrual we are self insured up to certain limit for cost associated with worker compensation claim vehicle accident and general business liability and benefit paid under employee healthcare and long term disability program our reserve are established for estimate of loss on reported claim including incurred but not reported claim self insurance accrual reflected in our balance sheet were billion at may and may approximately of these accrual were classified current liability our self insurance accrual are primarily based on the actuarially estimated undiscounted cost of claim incurred of the balance sheet date these estimate include consideration of factor such severity of claim frequency of claim and future healthcare cost cost trend on material accrual are updated each quarter we self insure up to certain limit that vary by operating company and type of risk periodically we evaluate the level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance level based on risk tolerance and premium expense historically it ha been infrequent that incurred claim exceeded our self insured limit we believe the use of actuarial method to account for these liability provides consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accrual however the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claim involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known we believe our recorded obligation for these expense are consistently measured on conservative basis nevertheless change in healthcare cost accident frequency and severity insurance retention level and other factor can materially affect the estimate for these liability long lived asset property and equipment our key business are capital intensive with approximately of our total asset invested in our transportation and information system infrastructure we capitalize only those cost that meet the definition of capital asset under accounting standard accordingly repair and maintenance cost that do not extend the useful life of an asset or are not part of the cost of acquiring the asset are expensed incurred the depreciation or amortization of our capital asset over their estimated useful life and the determination of any salvage value requires management to make judgment about future event because we utilize many of our capital asset over relatively long period the majority of aircraft cost are depreciated over to year we periodically evaluate whether adjustment to our estimated service life or salvage value are necessary to ensure these estimate properly match the economic use of the asset this evaluation may result in change in the estimated life and residual value used to depreciate our aircraft and other equipment in may we made the decision to shorten the depreciable life for aircraft and related engine to accelerate the retirement of these aircraft to better align the domestic air network capacity to match current and anticipated shipment volume in light of the delivery schedule for replacement aircraft due to our decision to accelerate retirement of certain aircraft and related engine our depreciation expense will increase over the next three year partially offset from the avoidance of depreciation related to aircraft retirement see the outlook section for additional information for our aircraft we typically assign no residual value due to the utilization of these asset in cargo configuration which result in little to no value at the end of their useful life these estimate affect the amount of depreciation expense recognized in period and ultimately the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset change in the estimated life of asset will result in an increase or decrease in the amount of depreciation recognized in future period and could have material impact on our result of operation historically gain and loss on disposal of operating equipment have not been material however such amount may differ materially in the future due to change in business level technological obsolescence accident frequency regulatory change and other factor beyond our control because of the lengthy lead time for aircraft manufacture and modification we must anticipate volume level and plan our fleet requirement year in advance and make commitment for aircraft based on those projection furthermore the timing and availability of certain used aircraft type particularly those with better fuel efficiency may create limited opportunity to acquire these aircraft at favorable price in advance of our capacity need these activity create risk that asset capacity may exceed demand and that an impairment of our asset may occur aircraft purchase primarily aircraft in passenger configuration that have not been placed in service totaled million at may and million at may we plan to modify these asset in the future and place them into operation table of content the accounting test for whether an asset held for use is impaired involves first comparing the carrying value of the asset with it estimated future undiscounted cash flow if the cash flow do not exceed the carrying value the asset must be adjusted to it current fair value we operate integrated transportation network and accordingly cash flow for most of our operating asset are assessed at network level not at an individual asset level for our analysis of impairment further decision about capital investment are evaluated based on the impact to the overall network rather than the return on an individual asset we make decision to remove certain long lived asset from service based on projection of reduced capacity need or lower operating cost of newer aircraft type and those decision may result in an impairment charge asset held for disposal must be adjusted to their estimated fair value le cost to sell when the decision is made to dispose of the asset and certain other criterion are met the fair value determination for such aircraft may require management estimate there may not be active market for some of these aircraft such estimate are subject to revision from period to period during the fourth quarter of we incurred noncash impairment charge of million this charge related to our may decision to permanently retire airbus aircraft and related engine well six boeing aircraft and related engine to better align the domestic air network capacity of fedex express to match current and anticipated shipment volume the majority of these aircraft were temporarily idled and not in revenue service in we incurred asset impairment charge of million related to the combination of our ltl operation at fedex freight there were no material property and equipment impairment charge recognized in lease we utilize operating lease to finance certain of our aircraft facility and equipment such arrangement typically shift the risk of loss on the residual value of the asset at the end of the lease period to the lessor disclosed in contractual cash obligation and note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement at may we had approximately billion on an undiscounted basis of future commitment for payment under operating lease the weighted average remaining lease term of all operating lease outstanding at may wa approximately six year the future commitment for operating lease are not reflected liability in our balance sheet under current accounting rule the determination of whether lease is accounted for capital lease or an operating lease requires management to make estimate primarily about the fair value of the asset and it estimated economic useful life in addition our evaluation includes ensuring we properly account for build to suit lease arrangement and making judgment about whether various form of lessee involvement during the construction period make the lessee an agent for the owner lessor or in substance the owner of the asset during the construction period we believe we have well defined and controlled process for making these evaluation including obtaining third party appraisal for material transaction to assist in making these evaluation under proposed revision to the accounting standard for lease we would be required to record an asset and liability for our outstanding operating lease similar to the current accounting for capital lease notably the amount we record in the future would be the net present value of our future lease commitment at the date of adoption this proposed guidance ha not been issued and ha been subjected to numerous revision since the proposal wa issued accordingly we can not make any judgment about the specific impact of the new proposed standard to however our existing financing agreement and the rating agency that evaluate our credit worthiness already take our operating lease into account table of content goodwill of may we had billion of recorded goodwill from our acquisition representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net asset we have acquired several factor give rise to goodwill in our acquisition such the expected benefit from synergy of the combination and the existing workforce of the acquired entity in our evaluation of goodwill impairment we perform qualitative assessment which requires management judgment and the use of estimate to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive we would proceed to two step process to test goodwill for impairment including comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with it carrying value including attributable goodwill fair value is estimated using standard valuation methodology principally the income or market approach incorporating market participant consideration and management assumption on revenue growth rate operating margin discount rate and expected capital expenditure estimate used by management can significantly affect the outcome of the impairment test change in forecasted operating result and other assumption could materially affect these estimate we perform our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter unless circumstance indicate the need to accelerate the timing of the test our reporting unit with significant recorded goodwill include our fedex express fedex freight and fedex office reported in the fedex service segment reporting unit we evaluated these reporting unit during the fourth quarter of and the estimated fair value of each of these reporting unit exceeded their carrying value in and and we do not believe that any of these reporting unit were at risk of may we have recorded goodwill impairment charge associated with our fedex office reporting unit in recent year while the performance of this business ha improved the realization of the value of the remaining attributable goodwill million is dependent upon execution of our growth strategy and initiative in the future in connection with our annual impairment testing of goodwill conducted in the fourth quarter of we recorded charge of million for impairment of the value of the remaining goodwill at our fedex national ltl reporting unit the impairment charge resulted from the significant negative impact of the recession on the ltl industry which resulted in volume and yield decline and operating loss in connection with the combination of our ltl network in this unit wa merged into the fedex freight reporting unit contingency we are subject to various loss contingency including tax proceeding and litigation in connection with our operation contingent liability are difficult to measure their measurement is subject to multiple factor that are not easily predicted or projected further additional complexity in measuring these liability arises due to the various jurisdiction in which these matter occur which make our ability to predict their outcome highly uncertain moreover different accounting rule must be employed to account for these item based on the nature of the contingency accordingly significant management judgment is required to ass these matter and to make determination about the measurement of liability if any our material pending loss contingency are described in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement in the opinion of management the aggregate liability if any of individual matter or group of matter not specifically described in note is not expected to be material to our financial position result of operation or cash flow the following describes our method and associated process for evaluating these matter tax contingency we are subject to income and operating tax rule of the it state and municipality and of the foreign jurisdiction in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining income tax provision well deferred tax asset and liability balance and related deferred tax valuation allowance if necessary due to the complexity of these rule and their interaction with one another we account for income tax by recording both current tax payable and deferred tax asset and liability our provision for income tax is based on domestic and international statutory income tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we operate applied to taxable income reduced by applicable tax credit tax contingency arise from uncertainty in the application of tax rule throughout the many jurisdiction in which we operate and are impacted by several factor including tax audit appeal litigation change in tax law and other rule and their interpretation and table of content change in our business we regularly ass the potential impact of these factor for the current and prior year to determine the adequacy of our tax provision we continually evaluate the likelihood and amount of potential adjustment and adjust our tax position including the current and deferred tax liability in the period in which the fact that give rise to revision become known in addition management considers the advice of third party in making conclusion regarding tax consequence we recognize liability for uncertain income tax position based on two step process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeal or litigation process if any the second step requires to estimate and measure the tax benefit the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amount we must determine the probability of various possible outcome we reevaluate these uncertain tax position on quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to management these reevaluation are based on factor including but not limited to change in fact or circumstance change in tax law successfully settled issue under audit and new audit activity such change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of tax benefit or an increase to the related provision we classify interest related to income tax liability interest expense and if applicable penalty are recognized component of income tax expense the income tax liability and accrued interest and penalty that are due within one year of the balance sheet date are presented current liability the remaining portion of our income tax liability and accrued interest and penalty are presented noncurrent liability because payment of cash is not anticipated within one year of the balance sheet date these noncurrent income tax liability are recorded in the caption other liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet we account for operating tax based on multi state local and foreign taxing jurisdiction rule in those area in which we operate provision for operating tax are estimated based upon these rule asset acquisition and disposal historical spend and other variable these provision are consistently evaluated for reasonableness against compliance and risk factor we measure and record operating tax contingency accrual in accordance with accounting guidance for contingency discussed below this guidance requires an accrual of estimated loss from contingency such tax or other legal proceeding or claim when it is probable that loss will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated other contingency because of the complex environment in which we operate we are subject to other legal proceeding and claim including those relating to general commercial matter employment related claim and fedex ground owner operator accounting guidance for contingency requires an accrual of estimated loss from contingency such tax or other legal proceeding or claim when it is probable the future event or event are likely to occur that loss will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated this guidance also requires disclosure of loss contingency matter when in management judgment material loss is reasonably possible or probable during the preparation of our financial statement we evaluate our contingency to determine whether it is probable reasonably possible or remote that liability ha been incurred loss is recognized for all contingency deemed probable and estimable regardless of amount for unresolved contingency with potentially material exposure that are deemed reasonably possible we evaluate whether potential loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated our evaluation of these matter is the result of comprehensive process designed to ensure that accounting recognition of loss or disclosure of these contingency is made in timely manner and involves our legal and accounting personnel well external counsel where applicable the process includes regular communication during each quarter and scheduled meeting shortly before the completion of our financial statement to evaluate any new legal proceeding and the status of any existing matter table of content in determining whether loss should be accrued or loss contingency disclosed we evaluate among other factor the current status of each matter within the scope and context of the entire lawsuit the lengthy and complex nature of class action matter the procedural status of each lawsuit any opportunity to dispose of the lawsuit on it merit before trial motion to dismiss or for summary judgment the amount of time remaining before the trial date the status of discovery the status of settlement arbitration or mediation proceeding and our judgment regarding the likelihood of success prior to or at trial in reaching our conclusion with respect to accrual of loss or loss contingency disclosure we take holistic view of each matter based on these factor and the information available prior to the issuance of our financial statement uncertainty with respect to an individual factor or combination of these factor may impact our decision related to accrual or disclosure of loss contingency including conclusion that we are unable to establish an estimate of possible loss or meaningful range of possible loss we update our disclosure to reflect our most current understanding of the contingency at the time we issue our financial statement however event may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of contingency may result in loss to that differs materially from our previously estimated liability or range of possible loss despite the inherent complexity in the accounting and disclosure of contingency we believe that our process are robust and thorough and provide consistent framework for management in evaluating the potential outcome of contingency for proper accounting recognition and disclosure risk factor our financial and operating result are subject to many risk and uncertainty described below we are directly affected by the state of the economy while macro economic risk apply to most company we are particularly vulnerable the transportation industry is highly cyclical and especially susceptible to trend in economic activity such the recent global recession our primary business is to transport good so our business level are directly tied to the purchase and production of good key macro economic measurement when individual and company purchase and produce fewer good we transport fewer good in addition we have relatively high fixed cost structure which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume level moreover we continue to grow our international business we are increasingly affected by the health of the global economy in global economic condition resulted in decreased demand for our domestic and international priority package service at fedex express customer utilized lower priced deferred service our business depend on our strong reputation and the value of the fedex brand the fedex brand name symbolizes high quality service reliability and speed fedex is one of the most widely recognized trusted and respected brand in the world and the fedex brand is one of our most important and valuable asset in addition we have strong reputation among customer and the general public for high standard of social and environmental responsibility and corporate governance and ethic the fedex brand name and our corporate reputation are powerful sale and marketing tool and we devote significant resource to promoting and protecting them adverse publicity whether or not justified relating to activity by our employee contractor or agent such customer service mishap or noncompliance with anti corruption law could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand with the increase in the use of social medium outlet such youtube and twitter adverse publicity can be disseminated quickly and broadly making it increasingly difficult for to defend against damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our service and thus have an adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity and result of operation well require additional resource to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand table of content we rely heavily on information and technology to operate our transportation and business network and any disruption to our technology infrastructure or the internet could harm our operation and our reputation among customer our ability to attract and retain customer and to compete effectively depends in part upon the sophistication and reliability of our technology network including our ability to provide feature of service that are important to our customer external and internal risk such malware code anomaly act of god attempt to penetrate our network data leakage and human error pose direct threat to our product service and data any disruption to the internet or our complex global technology infrastructure including those impacting our computer system and customer web site could adversely impact our customer service volume and revenue and result in increased cost these type of adverse impact could also occur in the event the confidentiality integrity or availability of company and customer information wa compromised due to data loss by fedex or trusted third party while we have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiative information technology risk management and disaster recovery plan these measure can not fully insulate from technology disruption or data loss and the resulting adverse effect on our operation and financial result our transportation business may be impacted by the price and availability of fuel we must purchase large quantity of fuel to operate our aircraft and vehicle and the price and availability of fuel can be unpredictable and beyond our control to date we have been mostly successful in mitigating over time the expense impact of higher fuel cost through our indexed fuel surcharge the amount of the surcharge is closely linked to the market price for fuel if we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharge because of competitive pricing pressure or some other reason fuel cost could adversely impact our operating result even if we are able to offset the cost of fuel with our surcharge high fuel surcharge could move our customer especially in the domestic market away from our higher yielding express service to our lower yielding ground service or even reduce customer demand for our service altogether in addition disruption in the supply of fuel could have negative impact on our ability to operate our transportation network our business are capital intensive and we must make capital decision based upon projected volume level we make significant investment in aircraft vehicle technology package handling facility sort equipment copy equipment and other asset to support our transportation and business network we also make significant investment to rebrand integrate and grow the company that we acquire the amount and timing of capital investment depend on various factor including our anticipated volume growth we must make commitment to purchase or modify aircraft year before the aircraft are actually needed we must predict volume level and fleet requirement and make commitment for aircraft based on those projection missing our projection could result in much or too little capacity relative to our shipping volume overcapacity could lead to asset disposition or write down and undercapacity could negatively impact service level for example in the fourth quarter of in order to better align the domestic air network capacity of fedex express to match current and anticipated shipment volume we made decision to retire from service certain aircraft and certain excess aircraft engine and thus recorded noncash impairment charge of million we are also developing operating and cost structure plan to further improve our efficiency at fedex express we face intense competition the transportation and business service market are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service especially in period of little or no macro economic growth some of our competitor have more financial resource than we do or they are controlled or subsidized by foreign government which enables them to raise capital more easily we believe we compete effectively with these company for example by providing more reliable service at compensatory price however an irrational pricing environment can limit our ability not only to maintain or increase our price including our fuel surcharge in response to rising fuel cost but also to maintain or grow our market share in addition high volume package shipper could develop in house ground delivery capability which would in turn reduce our revenue and market share while we believe we compete effectively through our current service offering if our current competitor or potential future competitor offer broader range of service or more effectively bundle their service or our current customer become competitor it could impede our ability to maintain or grow our market share table of content if we do not effectively operate integrate leverage and grow acquired business our financial result and reputation may suffer our strategy for long term growth productivity and profitability depends in part on our ability to make prudent strategic acquisition and to realize the benefit we expect when we make those acquisition in furtherance of this strategy we recently made strategic acquisition in mexico poland france and brazil while we expect our past and future acquisition to enhance our value proposition to customer and improve our long term profitability there can be no assurance that we will realize our expectation within the time frame we have established if at all or that we can continue to support the value we allocate to these acquired business including their goodwill or other intangible asset labor organization attempt to organize group of our employee from time to time and potential change in labor law could make it easier for them to do so if we are unable to continue to maintain good relationship with our employee and prevent labor organization from organizing group of our employee our operating cost could significantly increase and our operational flexibility could be significantly reduced despite continual organizing attempt by labor union other than the pilot of fedex express all of our employee have thus far chosen not to unionize the congress ha in the past considered adopting change in labor law however that would make it easier for union to organize unit of our employee for example there is always possibility that congress could remove most fedex express employee from the purview of the rla for additional discussion of the rla see part item of this annual report under the caption regulation such legislation could expose our customer to the type of service disruption that the rla wa designed to prevent local work stoppage in key area that interrupt the timely flow of shipment of time sensitive high value good throughout our global network such disruption could threaten our ability to provide competitively priced shipping option and ready access to global market there is also the possibility that congress could pas other labor legislation that could adversely affect our company such fedex ground and fedex freight whose employee are governed by the national labor relation act of amended the nlra in addition federal and state governmental agency such the national labor relation board have and may continue to take action that could make it easier for our employee to organize under the rla or nlra finally change to federal or state law governing employee classification could impact the status of fedex ground owner operator independent contractor fedex ground relies on owner operator to conduct it linehaul and pickup and delivery operation and the status of these owner operator independent contractor rather than employee is being challenged fedex ground use of independent contractor is well suited to the need of the ground delivery business and it customer evidenced by the strong growth of this business segment we are involved in numerous lawsuit and state tax and other administrative proceeding that claim that the company owner operator or their driver should be treated our employee rather than independent contractor we incur certain cost including legal fee in defending the status of fedex ground owner operator independent contractor we believe that fedex ground owner operator are properly classified independent contractor and that fedex ground is not an employer of the driver of the company independent contractor however adverse determination in these matter could among other thing entitle certain of our contractor and their driver to the reimbursement of certain expense and to the benefit of wage and hour law and result in employment and withholding tax and benefit liability for fedex ground and could result in change to the independent contractor status of fedex ground owner operator if fedex ground is compelled to convert it independent contractor to employee labor organization could more easily organize these individual our operating cost could increase materially and we could incur significant capital outlay the transportation infrastructure continues to be target of terrorist activity because transportation asset continue to be target of terrorist activity government around the world are adopting or are considering adopting stricter security requirement that will increase operating cost and potentially slow service for business including those in the transportation industry for example the transportation security administration continues to require fedex express to comply with full all cargo aircraft operator standard security plan which contains evolving and strict security requirement these requirement are not static but change periodically the result of regulatory and legislative requirement imposing additional security cost and creating level of uncertainty for our operation thus it is reasonably possible that these rule or other future security requirement could impose material cost on moreover terrorist attack directed at fedex or other aspect of the transportation infrastructure could disrupt our operation and adversely impact demand for our service table of content increased pilot safety requirement could impose substantial cost on the faa in september proposed rule that would significantly reduce the maximum number of hour on duty and increase the minimum amount of rest time for our pilot and thus require to hire additional pilot and modify certain of our aircraft when the faa issued final regulation in december all cargo carrier including fedex express were exempt from these new pilot fatigue requirement and instead required to continue complying with previously enacted flight and duty time rule in may however the faa indicated that it would reconsider the exclusion of cargo pilot from these new pilot fatigue requirement thus it is reasonably possible that these rule or other future flight safety requirement could impose material cost on the regulatory environment for global aviation or other transportation right may impact our operation our extensive air network is critical to our success our right to serve foreign point is subject to the approval of the department of transportation and generally requires bilateral agreement between the united state and foreign government in addition we must obtain the permission of foreign government to provide specific flight and service our operation outside of the united state such fedex express growing international domestic operation are also subject to current and potential regulation including certain postal regulation and licensing requirement that restrict make difficult and sometimes prohibit the ability of foreign owned company such fedex express to compete effectively in part of the international domestic transportation and logistics market regulatory action affecting global aviation or transportation right or failure to obtain or maintain aviation or other transportation right in important international market could impair our ability to operate our network we may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market response to such change concern over climate change including the impact of global warming ha led to significant and international legislative and regulatory effort to limit greenhouse gas ghg emission including our aircraft and diesel engine emission for example during the european commission approved the extension of the european union emission trading scheme ets for ghg emission to the airline industry under this decision all fedex express flight to and from any airport in any member state of the european union are now covered by the ets requirement and each year we are required to submit emission allowance in an amount equal to the carbon dioxide emission from such flight in addition the congress ha in the past considered bill that would regulate ghg emission and some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future increased regulation regarding ghg emission especially aircraft or diesel engine emission could impose substantial cost on especially at fedex express these cost include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital cost associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicle prematurely until the timing scope and extent of such regulation becomes known we can not predict it effect on our cost structure or our operating result it is reasonably possible however that it could impose material cost on moreover even without such regulation increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the ghgs emitted by company in the airline and transportation industry could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our service especially our air express service finally given the broad and global scope of our operation and our susceptibility to global macro economic trend we are particularly vulnerable to the physical risk of climate change that could affect all of humankind such shift in weather pattern and world ecosystem localized disaster in key geography could adversely impact our business while we operate several integrated network with asset distributed throughout the world there are concentration of key asset within our network that are exposed to localized risk from natural or manmade disaster such tornado flood earthquake or terrorist attack the loss of key location such our memphis super hub or one of our information technology center could cause significant disruption to our operation and cause to incur significant cost to reestablish or relocate these function moreover resulting economic dislocation including supply chain and fuel disruption could adversely impact demand for our service our business may be adversely impacted by disruption or modification in service by the usps the usps is significant customer and vendor of fedex and thus disruption or modification in service by the usps consequence of the usps current financial difficulty or any resulting structural change to it operation network service offering or pricing could have an table of content adverse effect on our operation and financial result for instance because fedex smartpost us the usps for final delivery to residence any change in usps service such the cessation of saturday delivery could impact the term and cost of our fedex smartpost service in addition the usps ha informed that it intends to solicit proposal for the provision of air transportation service currently provided by fedex express upon the expiration of the current agreement in september accordingly upon the expiration of the current agreement the transportation service we provide to the usps could be transitioned in whole or in part to another provider this would have negative impact on our asset utilization and profitability moreover to the extent that any such service are retained by the term and condition of the new arrangement may be le favorable than those currently in place we are also subject to other risk and uncertainty that affect many other business including increasing cost the volatility of cost and funding requirement and other legal mandate for employee benefit especially pension and healthcare benefit the increasing cost of compliance with federal and state governmental agency mandate and defending against inappropriate or unjustified enforcement or other action by such agency the impact of any international conflict on the united state and global economy in general the transportation industry or in particular and effect these event will have on our cost or the demand for our service any impact on our business resulting from new domestic or international government law and regulation change in foreign currency exchange rate especially in the british pound canadian dollar chinese yuan euro hong kong dollar and japanese yen which can affect our sale level and foreign currency sale price market acceptance of our new service and growth initiative any liability resulting from and the cost of defending against class action litigation such wage and hour and discrimination and retaliation claim and any other legal or governmental proceeding the outcome of future negotiation to reach new collective bargaining agreement including with the union that represents the pilot of fedex express the current pilot contract is scheduled to become amendable in march the impact of technology development on our operation and on demand for our service and our

cost rate of increase in future compensation level used to determine benefit obligation rate of increase in future compensation level used to determine net periodic benefit cost expected long term rate of return on asset table of content the estimated average rate of return on plan asset is the expected future long term rate of earnings on plan asset and is forward looking assumption that materially affect our pension cost establishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension asset is judgmental matter we review the expected long term rate of return on an annual basis and revise it appropriate management considers the following factor in determining this assumption the duration of our pension plan liability which drive the investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan asset the type of investment class in which we invest our pension plan asset and the expected compound geometric return we can reasonably expect those investment class to earn over time and the investment return we can reasonably expect our investment management program to achieve in excess of the return we could expect if investment were made strictly in indexed fund our estimated long term rate of return on plan asset remains at for consistent with our expected rate of return in and our actual return in each of the past three year exceeded that amount for our principal domestic pension plan for the year period ended may our actual return were pension expense is also affected by the accounting policy used to determine the value of plan asset at the measurement date we use calculated value method to determine the value of plan asset which help mitigate short term volatility in market performance both increase and decrease by amortizing certain actuarial gain or loss over period no longer than four year another method used in practice applies the market value of plan asset at the measurement date for purpose of valuing plan asset for determining pension expense the calculated value method resulted in the same value the market value it did in for determining pension expense we used the calculated value method which resulted in portion of the asset gain in being deferred to future year because our actual return on plan asset significantly exceeded our assumption the investment strategy for pension plan asset is to utilize diversified mix of global public and private equity portfolio together with fixed income portfolio to earn long term investment return that meet our pension plan obligation our pension plan asset are invested primarily in listed security and our pension plan hold only minimal investment in fedex common stock that is entirely at the discretion of third party pension fund investment manager our largest holding class are corporate fixed income security large cap equity which is indexed to the index and government fixed income security accordingly we do not have any significant concentration of risk active management strategy are utilized within the plan in an effort to realize investment return in excess of market index part of our strategy to manage future pension cost and net funded status volatility we have transitioned to liability driven investment strategy with greater concentration of fixed income security to better align plan asset with liability our investment strategy also includes the limited use of derivative financial instrument on discretionary basis to improve investment return and manage exposure to market risk in all case our investment manager are prohibited from using derivative for speculative purpose and are not permitted to use derivative to leverage portfolio table of content following is description of the valuation methodology used for

lawsuit containing various class action allegation of wage and hour violation the plaintiff in these lawsuit allege among other thing that they were forced to work off the clock were not paid overtime or were not provided work break or other benefit the complaint generally seek unspecified monetary damage injunctive relief or both we do not believe that material loss is reasonably possible with respect to any of these matter independent contractor lawsuit and state administrative proceeding fedex ground is involved in numerous class action lawsuit including that have been certified class action individual lawsuit and state tax and other administrative proceeding that claim that the company owner operator should be treated employee rather than independent contractor table of content most of the class action lawsuit were consolidated for administration of the pre trial proceeding by single federal court the district court for the northern district of indiana the multidistrict litigation court granted class certification in case and denied it in case on december the court entered an opinion and order addressing all outstanding motion for summary judgment on the status of the owner operator independent contractor employee in sum the court ha now ruled on our summary judgment motion and entered judgment in favor of fedex ground on all claim in of the multidistrict litigation case that had been certified class action finding that the owner operator in those case were contractor matter of the law of the following state alabama arizona georgia indiana kansa the court previously dismissed without prejudice the nationwide class claim under the employee retirement income security act of based on the plaintiff failure to exhaust administrative remedy louisiana maryland minnesota new jersey new york north carolina ohio pennsylvania rhode island south carolina tennessee texas utah west virginia and wisconsin the plaintiff filed notice of appeal in all of these case the seventh circuit heard the appeal in the kansa case in january and in july issued an opinion that did not make determination with respect to the correctness of the district court decision and instead certified two question to the kansa supreme court related to the classification of the plaintiff independent contractor under the kansa wage payment act the multidistrict litigation court remanded the other eight certified class action back to the district court where they were originally filed because it summary judgment ruling did not completely dispose of all of the claim in those lawsuit specifically in the five case in arkansas california florida and oregon two certified case the court ruling granted summary judgment in fedex ground favor on all of the certified claim but did not decide the uncertified claim in the three case filed in kentucky nevada and new hampshire the court ruled in favor of fedex ground on some of the claim and against fedex ground on at least one claim in may the oregon district court dismissed the two oregon case but in june the plaintiff in both case filed notice of appeal with the ninth circuit court of appeal in june the kentucky district court ruled in favor of fedex ground on certain of the plaintiff claim thereby reducing our potential exposure in the matter in january one of the contractor model lawsuit that is not part of the multidistrict litigation anfinson fedex ground wa certified class action by washington state court the plaintiff in anfinson represent class of single route pickup and delivery owner operator in washington from december through december and allege that the class member should be reimbursed employee for their uniform expense and should receive overtime pay in march jury trial in the anfinson case wa held and the jury returned verdict in favor of fedex ground finding that all class member were independent contractor not employee the plaintiff appealed the verdict in december the washington court of appeal reversed and remanded for further proceeding including new trial we filed motion to reconsider and this motion wa denied in march we filed discretionary appeal with the washington supreme court and in august that petition wa granted the washington supreme court heard oral argument in february in august another one of the contractor model lawsuit that is not part of the multidistrict litigation rascon fedex ground wa certified class action by colorado state court the plaintiff in rascon represents class of single route pickup and delivery owner operator in colorado who drove vehicle weighing le than pound at any time from august through the present the lawsuit seek unpaid overtime compensation and related penalty and attorney fee and cost under colorado law our application for appeal challenging this class certification decision have been rejected we settled this matter for an immaterial amount subject to court approval in june other contractor model case that are not or are no longer part of the multidistrict litigation are in varying stage of litigation with respect to the state administrative proceeding relating to the classification of fedex ground owner operator independent contractor during the second quarter of the attorney general in new york and kentucky each filed lawsuit against fedex ground challenging the validity of the contractor model in january fedex ground settled the lawsuit filed by the kentucky attorney general for an immaterial amount and in april the lawsuit wa dismissed while the granting of summary judgment in favor of fedex ground by the multidistrict litigation court in of the case that had been certified class action remains subject to appeal we believe that it significantly improves the likelihood that our independent contractor model will be upheld adverse determination in matter related to fedex ground independent contractor however table of content could among other thing entitle certain of our contractor and their driver to the reimbursement of certain expense and to the benefit of wage and hour law and result in employment and withholding tax and benefit liability for fedex ground and could result in change to the independent contractor status of fedex ground owner operator in certain jurisdiction we believe that fedex ground owner operator are properly classified independent contractor and that fedex ground is not an employer of the driver of the company independent contractor while it is reasonably possible that potential loss in some of these lawsuit or such change to the independent contractor status of fedex ground owner operator could be material we can not yet determine the amount or reasonable range of potential loss number of factor contribute to this the number of plaintiff in these lawsuit continues to change with some being dismissed and others being added and to new plaintiff discovery is still ongoing in addition the party have not yet conducted any discovery into damage which could vary considerably from plaintiff to plaintiff further the range of potential loss could be impacted considerably by future ruling on the merit of certain claim and fedex ground various defense and on evidentiary issue in any event we do not believe that material loss is probable in these matter ata airline in october jury returned verdict in favor of ata airline in it breach of contract lawsuit against fedex express and awarded damage of million and in january the court awarded ata pre judgment interest of million in december the seventh circuit overturned the entire judgment entered against fedex express ata airline requested the seventh circuit to rehear oral argument on appeal and in february the seventh circuit denied the request we have reversed the million accrual established in the second quarter of after the seventh circuit denied ata airline request for the seventh circuit to rehear oral argument on appeal ata airline asked the supreme court to accept discretionary appeal of the matter we believe that it is unlikely that the supreme court will accept the discretionary appeal california paystub class action federal court in california ruled in april that paystubs for certain fedex express employee in california did not meet that state requirement to reflect pay period begin date total overtime hour worked and the correct overtime wage rate the ruling came in class action lawsuit filed by former courier seeking damage on behalf of and all other fedex express employee in california that allegedly received noncompliant paystubs the court certified the class in june the court ruled that fedex express wa liable to the state of california and wa prepared to rule to whether fedex express wa liable to class member who could prove they were injured by the paystub deficiency the judge did not decide on the amount if any of liability to the state of california or to the class but had wide discretion prior to any decision on the amount of liability we reached an agreement to settle this matter for an immaterial amount in october subject to approval by the court the court granted final approval of the settlement in july other matter in august third party consultant who work with shipping customer to negotiate lower rate filed lawsuit in federal district court in california against fedex and ups alleging violation of antitrust law this matter wa dismissed in may but the court granted the plaintiff permission to file an amended complaint which fedex received in june in november the court granted our motion to dismiss this complaint but allowed the plaintiff to file an amended complaint the plaintiff filed new complaint in december and the matter remains pending before the

into the policy and practice of fedex and ups for dealing with third party consultant who work with shipping customer to negotiate lower rate we are cooperating with the investigation do not believe that we have engaged in any anti competitive activity and will vigorously defend in any action that may result from the investigation while the litigation proceeding and the doj investigation are in an early stage and the amount of loss if any is dependent on number of factor that are not yet fully developed or resolved we do not believe that material loss is reasonably possible we have received request for information from the doj in the northern district of california in connection with criminal investigation relating to the transportation of package for online pharmacy that may have shipped pharmaceutical in violation of federal law we responded to grand jury subpoena issued in june and august and to additional request for information pursuant to those subpoena and we continue to respond and cooperate with the investigation we do not believe that we have engaged in any illegal activity and will vigorously defend ourselves in any action that may result from the investigation we

decrease in fair value resulting from hypothetical increase in interest rate and amount to million of may and million of may the underlying fair value of our long term debt were estimated based on quoted market price or on the current rate offered for debt with similar term and maturity we have interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligation change in interest rate impact our liability associated with these benefit plan well the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized decline in the value of plan asset could diminish the funded status of our pension plan and potentially increase our requirement to make contribution to the plan substantial investment loss on plan asset will also increase pension and postretirement benefit expense in the year following the loss foreign currency while we are global provider of transportation commerce and business service the substantial majority of our transaction are denominated

exposure to foreign currency fluctuation is more significant with respect to our revenue than our expense significant portion of our expense are denominated in dollar such aircraft and fuel expense during and foreign currency fluctuation positively impacted operating income however favorable foreign currency fluctuation also may have had an offsetting impact on the price we obtained or the demand for our service which is not quantifiable at may the result of uniform strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to the currency in which our transaction are denominated would result in decrease in operating income of million for this theoretical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the dollar this calculation is not indicative of our actual experience in foreign currency transaction in addition to the direct effect of change in exchange rate fluctuation in exchange rate also affect the volume of sale or the foreign currency sale price competitor service become more or le attractive the sensitivity analysis of the effect of change in foreign currency exchange rate doe not factor in potential change in sale level or local currency price commodity while we have market risk for change in the price of jet and vehicle fuel this risk is largely mitigated by our fuel surcharge because our fuel surcharge are closely linked to market price for fuel therefore hypothetical change in the price of fuel would not be expected to materially affect our earnings however our fuel surcharge have timing lag approximately six to eight week for fedex express and fedex ground before they are adjusted for change in fuel price our fuel surcharge index also allows fuel price to fluctuate approximately for fedex express and approximately
