include marketable equity security and equity derivative instrument we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activity at the inception of our investment in the event we do decide to enter into hedge arrangement before so we evaluate legal market and economic factor well the expected timing of disposal to determine whether hedging is appropriate our equity market risk management program may include equity derivative with or without hedge accounting designation that utilize warrant equity option or other equity derivative we also utilize total return swap to offset change in liability related to the equity market risk of certain deferred compensation arrangement gain or loss from change in fair value of these total return swap

significant impact on our financial position and the result that we report in our consolidated financial statement while we believe that our estimate assumption and judgment are reasonable they are based on information available when the estimate wa made refer to note accounting policy within the consolidated financial statement for further information on our critical accounting estimate and policy which are follows inventory the transition of manufacturing cost to inventory excluding factory excess capacity cost inventoried product reflected at the lower of cost or net realizable value considering future demand and market condition property plant and equipment the useful life determination and the related timing of when depreciation begin long lived asset the valuation method and assumption used in assessing the impairment of property plant and equipment identified intangible and goodwill including the determination of asset grouping and the identification and allocation of goodwill to reporting unit non marketable equity investment the valuation estimate and assessment of other than temporary impairment business combination the assumption used to allocate the purchase price paid for asset acquired and liability assumed in connection with our acquisition income tax the identification and measurement of deferred tax asset and liability and the provisional estimate associated with tax reform and loss contingency the estimation of when loss is probable and reasonably estimable risk factorsthe following risk could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition cash flow and result of operation and the trading price of our common stock could decline these risk factor do not identify all risk that we face our operation could also be affected by factor that are not presently known to or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operation due to risk and uncertainty known and unknown our past financial result may not be reliable indicator of future performance and historical trend should not be used to anticipate result or trend in future period refer also to the other information set forth in this annual report on form including md result of operation and our financial statement and the related note change in product demand can adversely affect our financial result demand for our product is variable and hard to predict our platform product are used across different market segment and demand for our platform may vary within or among our client computing data center internet of thing and other market segment it is difficult to anticipate the impact of these change demand may increase in one or more market segment while decreasing in others change in the demand for our product particularly in the client computing or data center market segment may reduce our revenue lower our gross margin or require to write down the value of our asset important factor that could lead to variation in the demand for our product include change in business condition including downturn in the market segment in which we operate or in the global or regional economy consumer confidence or income level caused by change in market condition including change in government borrowing taxation or spending policy the credit market or expected inflation employment and energy or other commodity price the level of our customer inventory competitive and pricing pressure including action taken by competitor customer order pattern including order cancellation failure to timely introduce competitive product and market acceptance and industry support of our new and maturing product due to the complexity of our manufacturing operation we may be unable to timely respond to fluctuation in demand and we may incur significant charge and cost because we own and operate high tech fabrication facility our operation have high cost that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term including our cost related to utilization of existing facility facility construction and equipment and the employment and training of highly skilled workforce if product demand decrease or we fail to forecast demand accurately we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charge which would lower our gross margin if the demand decrease is prolonged our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized and we may be required to write down our long lived asset which would increase our expense we may also be required to shorten the useful life of under used facility and equipment and accelerate depreciation conversely if product demand increase we may be unable to add capacity fast enough to meet market demand we face significant competition the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market development change in industry standard change in customer need and frequent product introduction and improvement if we do not anticipate and respond to these development our competitive position may weaken and our product or technology might be uncompetitive or become obsolete additionally number of business combination including merger asset acquisition and strategic partnership in the semiconductor industry have occurred over the last several year and more could occur in the future consolidation in the industry could lead to fewer customer partner or supplier any of which could negatively affect our financial result in recent year in connection with our strategic transformation to data centric company we have entered new area and introduced adjacent product in programmable solution ai and autonomous driving we have also expanded our adjacent product offering in client computing the data center the internet of thing and memory with offering such modem silicon photonics solution and xpoint technology product result we face new source of competition including in certain of these market segment from incumbent competitor with established customer base and greater brand recognition these developing product and market segment may not grow significantly projected or at all or may utilize technology that are different from the one that we develop and manufacture to be successful we need to cultivate new industry relationship with customer and partner in these market segment in addition we must continually improve the cost performance integration and energy efficiency of our product well expand our software capability to provide customer with comprehensive computing solution despite our ongoing effort there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain market demand or acceptance for our product and service in these various market segment other key information of contentsto compete successfully we must maintain successful effort develop new product and production process and improve our existing product and process ahead of competitor for example we invest substantially in our network of manufacturing and assembly and test facility including the construction of new fabrication facility to support smaller transistor geometry and larger wafer we do not expect all of our investment to be successful we may be unable to develop and market new product successfully and the product and technology we invest in and develop may not be well received by customer our investment may not contribute to our future operating result for several year if at all and such contribution may not meet our expectation or even cover the cost of such investment additionally the product and technology offered by others may affect demand for or pricing of our product if we are not able to compete effectively our financial result will be adversely affected including reduced revenue and gross margin and we may be required to accelerate the write down of the value of certain asset change in the mix of product sold may impact our financial result our pricing and margin vary across our product and market segment due in part to marketability of our product and difference in their feature or manufacturing cost for example our platform product offering range from lower priced and entry level platform such those based on intel atom processor to higher end platform based on intel xeon processor if demand shift from our higher priced to lower priced product in any of our market segment our gross margin and revenue would decrease we operate globally and are subject to significant risk in many jurisdiction global or regional condition may harm our financial result we have manufacturing assembly and test sale and other operation in many country and some of our business activity may be concentrated in one or more geographic area moreover sale outside the accounted for approximately of our revenue for the fiscal year ended december result our operation and our financial result including our ability to manufacture assemble and test design develop or sell product may be adversely affected by number of factor outside of our control including global and regional economic condition geopolitical and security issue such armed conflict and civil or military unrest political instability including geopolitical uncertainty on the korean peninsula human right concern and terrorist activity natural disaster public health issue and other catastrophic event inefficient infrastructure and other disruption such supply chain interruption and large scale outage or unreliable provision of service from utility transportation data hosting or telecommunication provider government restriction on or nationalization of our operation in any country or restriction on our ability to repatriate earnings from particular country differing employment practice and labor issue formal or informal imposition of new or revised export and or import and doing business regulation including trade sanction and tariff which could be changed without notice ineffective legal protection of our ip right in certain country local business and cultural factor that differ from our current standard and practice and continuing uncertainty regarding social political immigration and tax and trade policy in the and abroad including the united kingdom vote to withdraw from the european union we are subject to law and regulation worldwide which may differ among jurisdiction affecting our operation in area including but not limited to ip ownership and infringement tax import and export requirement anti corruption foreign exchange control and cash repatriation restriction data privacy requirement competition advertising employment product regulation environment health and safety requirement and consumer law compliance with such requirement may be onerous and expensive and may otherwise impact our business operation negatively for example unfavorable development with evolving law and regulation worldwide related to technology may limit it global introduction and adoption which could impede our modem strategy and negatively impact our long term outlook although we have policy control and procedure designed to help ensure compliance with applicable law there can be no assurance that our employee contractor supplier and or agent will not violate such law or our policy violation of these law and regulation could result in fine criminal sanction against our officer or our employee prohibition on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation we may be affected by fluctuation in currency exchange rate we are potentially exposed to adverse well beneficial movement in currency exchange rate although most of our sale occur in dollar expense may be paid in local currency an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customer of our product in those market outside the where we sell in dollar and weakened dollar could increase the cost of expense such payroll utility tax and marketing expense well overseas capital expenditure we also conduct certain investing and financing activity in local currency our hedging program reduce but do not eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movement therefore change in exchange rate could harm our result of operation and financial condition other key information of contentscatastrophic event could have material adverse effect on our operation and financial result our operation and business could be disrupted by natural disaster industrial accident public health issue cybersecurity incident interruption of service from utility transportation or telecommunication provider or other catastrophic event such event could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver product to our customer receive production material from our supplier or perform critical function which could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery time and expenditure to resume operation while we maintain business recovery plan that are intended to enable to recover from natural disaster or other event that can be disruptive to our business some of our system are not fully redundant and we can not be sure that our plan will fully protect from all such disruption we maintain program of insurance coverage for variety of property casualty and other risk the type and amount of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability cost and decision with respect to risk retention some of our policy have large deductible and broad exclusion in addition one or more of our insurance provider may be unable or unwilling to pay claim loss not covered by insurance may be large which could harm our result of operation and financial condition we are vulnerable to product and manufacturing related risk we are subject to risk associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing process technology production of integrated circuit is complex process our strategy is significantly dependent upon the timely advancement of moore law and we are continually engaged in the development of next generation process technology we may not be successful or efficient in developing or implementing new process node and production process our effort to innovate involve significant expense and carry inherent risk including difficulty in designing and developing such next generation process technology and investment in manufacturing asset and facility year in advance of the process node introduction risk inherent in the development of next generation process technology include production timing delay lower than anticipated manufacturing yield and product defect and erratum disruption in the production process can also result from error defect in material delay in obtaining or revising operating permit and license interruption in our supply of material or resource and disruption at our fabrication and assembly and test facility due to accident maintenance issue or unsafe working condition all of which could affect the timing of production ramp and yield production issue can lead to increased cost and may affect our ability to meet product demand which could adversely impact our business and the result of operation in addition if we face unexpected delay in the timing of our product introduction our revenue and gross margin could be adversely affected because we incur significant cost up front in the product development stage and earn revenue to offset these cost over time we face supply chain risk thousand of supplier provide material and equipment that we use in production and other aspect of our business where possible we seek to have several source of supply however for certain material we may rely on single or limited number of supplier or upon supplier in single location in addition consolidation among supplier could impact the nature quality availability and pricing of the product and service available to the inability of supplier to deliver necessary production material or equipment could disrupt our production process and make it more difficult for to implement our business strategy production could be disrupted by the unavailability of resource such water silicon electricity gas and other material the unavailability or reduced availability of material or resource may require to reduce production or incur additional cost which could harm our business and result of operation our manufacturing operation and ability to meet product demand may also be impacted by ip or other litigation between our supplier where an injunction against intel or supplier could interrupt the availability of good or service supplied to intel by others we also rely on third party provider to manufacture and assemble and test certain component or product particularly those related to networking communication programmable semiconductor solution and nand flash memory if any of these third party are unable to perform these service on timely or cost effective basis we may encounter supply delay or disruption that could adversely affect our business and financial result in addition increased regulation or stakeholder expectation regarding responsible sourcing practice could cause our compliance cost to increase or result in publicity that negatively affect our reputation moreover given that we use many material in the manufacturing of our product and rely on many supplier to provide these material but do not directly control the procurement or employment practice of such supplier we could be subject to similar financial or reputational risk result of our supplier conduct other key information of contentswe are subject to the risk of product defect erratum or other product issue product defect and erratum deviation from published specification may result from problem in our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test process component and product we purchase or license from third party supplier or attain through acquisition may also contain defect we could face risk if product that we design manufacture or sell or that include our technology cause personal injury or property damage even where the cause is unrelated to product defect or erratum these risk may increase our product are introduced into new device market segment technology or application including wearable drone and transportation health care and financial transaction and other industrial and consumer us cost from defect erratum or other product issue could include writing off some or all of the value of inventory recalling product that have been shipped providing product replacement or modification reimbursing customer for certain cost they incur defending against litigation and or paying resulting damage and paying fine imposed by regulatory agency these cost could be large and may increase expense and lower gross margin and result in delay or loss of revenue any product defect erratum or other issue could also damage our reputation negatively affect product demand delay product release or result in legal liability the announcement of product defect or erratum could cause customer to purchase product from competitor any of these occurrence could harm our business and financial result in addition although we maintain liability insurance our coverage ha certain exclusion and or may not adequately cover liability incurred our insurance provider may be unable or unwilling to pay claim and loss not covered by insurance could be large which could harm our financial condition we are subject to risk associated with environmental health and safety regulation and climate change the manufacturing and assembly and test of our product require the use of hazardous material that are subject to broad array of environmental health and safety law and regulation our failure to comply with these law or regulation could result in regulatory penalty fine and legal liability suspension of production alteration of our manufacturing and assembly and test process damage to our reputation and restriction on our operation or sale our failure to manage the use transportation emission discharge storage recycling or disposal of hazardous material could lead to increased cost or future liability our ability to expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future may be impeded by environmental regulation such air quality and wastewater requirement environmental law and regulation could also require to acquire additional pollution abatement or remediation equipment modify product design or incur other expense many new material that we are evaluating for use in our operation may be subject to regulation under environmental law and regulation these restriction could harm our business and result of operation by increasing our expense or requiring to alter manufacturing and assembly and test process climate change may also pose regulatory and environmental risk that could harm our result of operation and affect the way we conduct business for example climate change regulation could result in increased manufacturing cost associated with air pollution control requirement and increased or new monitoring recordkeeping and reporting of greenhouse gas emission we also see the potential for higher energy cost driven by climate change regulation if for example utility company pas on their cost to their customer furthermore many of our operation are located in semi arid region such arizona new mexico and israel that may become increasingly vulnerable to rising average temperature or prolonged drought due to climate change our fabrication facility require significant water use and while we recycle and reuse portion of the water used we may have difficulty obtaining sufficient water to fulfill our operational need in addition climate change may pose physical and regulatory risk to our supplier including increased extreme weather event that could result in supply delay or disruption we are subject to cybersecurity and privacy risk third party regularly attempt to gain unauthorized access to our network product service and infrastructure we regularly face attempt by others to gain unauthorized access through the internet or to introduce malicious software to our it system additionally individual or organization including malicious hacker or intruder into our physical facility may attempt to gain unauthorized access and corrupt the process of hardware and software product that we manufacture and service we provide due to the widespread use of our product we are frequent target of computer hacker and organization that intend to sabotage take control of or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other process product and service we are also target of malicious attacker who attempt to gain access to our network or data center or those of our customer or end user steal proprietary information related to our business product employee and customer or interrupt our system and service or those of our customer or others we believe such attempt are increasing in number and in technical sophistication we become more data centric company our processor may be used in more and different critical application area and may be subject to increased cybersecurity and privacy risk from time to time we encounter intrusion or unauthorized access to our network product service or infrastructure to date none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business or operation such incident whether or not successful could result in our incurring significant cost related to for example rebuilding internal system writing down inventory value implementing other key information of contentsadditional threat protection measure providing modification to our product and service defending against litigation responding to regulatory inquiry or action paying damage providing customer with incentive to maintain the business relationship or taking other remedial step with respect to third party in addition these threat are constantly evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measure while we seek to detect and investigate all unauthorized attempt and attack against our network product and service and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through change to our internal process and tool and or change or update to our product and service we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threat in some instance we our customer and the user of our product and service may be unaware of an incident or it magnitude and effect security vulnerability may exist with respect to our processor and other product well the operating system and workload running on them mitigation technique designed to address these security vulnerability including software and firmware update or other preventative measure may not operate intended or effectively resolve these vulnerability in addition we may be required to rely on third party including hardware software and service vendor well end user to develop and deploy mitigation technique and the effectiveness of mitigation technique may depend solely or in part on the action of these third party security vulnerability and or mitigation technique including software and firmware update may result in adverse performance reboots system instability data loss or corruption unpredictable system behavior or the misappropriation of data by third party which could adversely impact our business and harm our reputation side channel exploit is type of security vulnerability that ha recently received attention result of the variant referred to spectre and meltdown information on these variant wa prematurely reported publicly before mitigation technique to address all vulnerability were made widely available and certain of the mitigation technique did not operate intended to date we do not expect material financial impact to our business or operation from these security vulnerability however subsequent event or new information could develop which change our expectation including additional information learned we deploy update evaluate the competitiveness of existing and new product address future warranty or other claim or customer satisfaction consideration well development in the course of responding to any litigation or investigation over these matter the recent publicity regarding side channel exploit may also result in increased attempt by third party to identify additional variant we will continue to reassess whether or not we expect to be exposed to loss that could be material result of the foregoing risk we have and may continue to face product claim litigation and adverse publicity and customer relation from security vulnerability and or mitigation technique publicity about security vulnerability and attempted or successful exploit whether accurate or inaccurate may result in increased attempt by third party to identify additional vulnerability this publicity could damage our reputation with customer or user and reduce demand for our product and service in addition future vulnerability and mitigation of those vulnerability may also adversely impact our result of operation financial condition customer relationship and reputation moreover we may be unable to anticipate the timing of the release of information by third party regarding potential vulnerability of our product which in turn ha and could adversely impact our ability to timely introduce mitigation technique and thereby harm our business and reputation we may be subject to theft loss or misuse of personal data about our employee customer or other third party which could increase our expense damage our reputation or result in legal or regulatory proceeding the theft loss or misuse of personal data collected used stored or transferred by to run our business could result in significantly increased business and security cost or cost related to defending legal claim global privacy legislation enforcement and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating complex regulatory compliance environment cost to comply with and implement these privacy related and data protection measure could be significant in addition even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal state or international privacy related or data protection law and regulation could result in proceeding against by governmental entity or others we are subject to ip risk and risk associated with litigation and regulatory proceeding we may be unable to enforce or protect our ip right we regard our patent copyright trade secret and other ip right important to the success of our business we rely on ip law well confidentiality and licensing agreement with our customer employee technology development partner and others to protect our ip right our ability to enforce these right is subject to general litigation risk well uncertainty to the enforceability of our ip right in various country when we seek to enforce our right we may be subject to claim that our ip right are invalid not enforceable or licensed to an opposing party our assertion of ip right may result in another party seeking to assert claim against which could harm our business government may adopt regulation and government or court may render decision requiring compulsory licensing of ip right or government may require product to meet standard that favor local company our inability to enforce our ip right under any of these circumstance may harm our competitive position and business in addition the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secret and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our product result the value of our investment in product development and marketing could be reduced our license with other company and participation in industry initiative may allow competitor to use our patent right technology company often bilaterally license patent between each other to settle dispute or part of business agreement our competitor may have license to our patent and under current case law some of the license may exhaust our patent right to licensed product sale under some circumstance our participation in industry standard organization or with other industry initiative may require to license our patent to company that adopt industry standard specification depending on the rule of the organization government regulation or court decision we might have to grant license to our patent for little or no cost and result we may be unable to enforce certain patent against others our cost of enforcing our license or protecting our patent may increase and the value of our ip right may be impaired other key information of contentsthird party may assert claim based on ip right against or our product which could harm our business we may face claim based on ip right from individual and company including claim from those who have aggregated patent acquired from multiple source to form new larger portfolio to assert claim against and other company additionally large patent portfolio owner may divest portion of their portfolio to more than one individual or company increasing the number of party who own ip right previously all held by single party we are typically engaged in number of dispute involving ip right claim that our product or process infringe the ip right of others regardless of their merit could cause to incur large cost to respond to defend and resolve the claim and they may divert the effort and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business and operation in addition we may face claim based on the alleged theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third party trade secret and other confidential information or end user data that we obtain in conducting our business any such incident and claim could severely disrupt our business and we could suffer loss including the cost of product recall and return and reputational harm furthermore we have agreed to indemnify customer for certain ip right claim against them result of ip right claim we could pay monetary damage including payment to satisfy indemnification obligation stop manufacturing using selling offering to sell or importing product or technology subject to claim need to develop other product or technology not subject to claim which could be time consuming or costly and or enter into settlement and license agreement which agreement may not be available on commercially reasonable term these ip right claim could harm our competitive position result in expense or require to impair our asset if we alter or stop production of affected item our revenue could be harmed we rely on access to third party ip which may not be available to on commercially reasonable term or at all many of our product include third party technology and or implement industry standard and may require license from third party based on past experience and industry practice we believe such license generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable term however there is no assurance that the necessary license can be obtained on acceptable term or at all failure to obtain the right to use third party technology or to license ip on commercially reasonable term could preclude from selling certain product or otherwise have material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating result we are subject to the risk associated with litigation and regulatory proceeding we may face legal claim or regulatory matter involving stockholder consumer competition and other issue on global basis described in note commitment and contingency within the consolidated financial statement we are engaged in number of litigation and regulatory matter litigation and regulatory proceeding are inherently uncertain and adverse ruling could occur including monetary damage or an injunction stopping from manufacturing or selling certain product engaging in certain business practice or requiring other remedy such compulsory licensing of patent an unfavorable outcome may result in material adverse impact on our business financial condition and result of operation in addition regardless of the outcome litigation and regulatory proceeding can be costly time consuming disruptive to our operation and distracting to management we must attract retain and motivate key employee to be competitive we must attract retain and motivate executive and other key employee hiring and retaining qualified executive scientist engineer technical staff and sale representative are critical to our business and competition for experienced employee can be intense to help attract retain and motivate qualified employee we use share based and other performance based incentive award such rsus and cash bonus also key to our employee hiring and retention is our ability to build and maintain an inclusive business culture and be viewed an employer of choice if our share based or other compensation program and workplace culture cease to be viewed competitive our ability to attract retain and motivate employee could be weakened which could harm our result of operation we are subject to risk associated with our strategic transaction we invest in company for strategic reason and may not realize return on our investment we make investment in public and private company around the world to further our strategic objective and support key business initiative many of the instrument in which we invest are non marketable at the time of our initial investment company in which we invest range from early stage company still defining their strategic direction to mature company with established revenue stream and business model the success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on the company access to additional funding on favorable term or liquidity event such public offering or acquisition if any of the company in which we invest fail we could lose all or part of our investment our acquisition divestiture and other strategic transaction could fail to achieve our financial or strategic objective disrupt our ongoing business and adversely impact our result of operation in pursuing our business strategy we routinely conduct discussion evaluate opportunity and enter into agreement for possible acquisition divestiture and other strategic transaction these transaction involve numerous risk including the transaction may not advance our business strategy and it

are limited and our decision to pursue transaction ha opportunity cost accordingly if we pursue particular transaction we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transaction that could help achieve our financial or strategic objective any of these risk could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition or cash flow particularly in the case of large acquisition or several concurrent acquisition we are subject to sale related risk we face risk related to sale through distributor and other third party we sell significant portion of our product through third party such distributor value added resellers and channel partner collectively referred to distributor well oems odms and internet service provider we depend on many distributor to help create end customer demand provide technical support and other value added service to customer fill customer order and stock our product we may rely on one or more key distributor for product and material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributor or their failure to perform expected could reduce our revenue our ability to add or replace distributor for some of our product may be limited in addition our distributor expertise in the determination and stocking of acceptable inventory level for some of our product may not be easily transferable to new distributor result end customer may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of distributor using third party for distribution expose to many risk including competitive pressure and concentration credit and compliance risk distributor and other third party may sell product that compete with our product and we may need to provide financial and other incentive to focus them on the sale of our product they may face financial difficulty including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of account receivable and financial result violation of the foreign corrupt practice act or similar law by distributor or other third party intermediary could have material impact on our business failure to manage risk related to our use of distributor and other third party may reduce sale increase expense and weaken our competitive position we receive significant portion of our revenue from limited number of customer collectively our three largest customer accounted for approximately of our net revenue in and of our net revenue in we expect small number of customer will continue to account for significant portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future if one of our key customer stop purchasing from materially reduces it demand for our product or delay it order for our product we may experience reduction in revenue which could harm our result of operation and financial condition for more information about our customer including customer who accounted for greater than of our net consolidated revenue see note operating segment within the consolidated financial statement we face risk related to business transaction with government entity we receive proceeds from service and product we provide to the government government demand and payment may be affected by public sector budgetary cycle and funding authorization government contract are subject to oversight including special rule on accounting ip right expense review information handling and security failure to comply with these rule could result in civil and criminal penalty and sanction including termination of contract fine and suspension or debarment from future business with the government change in our

generally accepted accounting principle gaap requires to make estimate and judgment that affect the amount reported in our consolidated financial statement and the accompanying note the actual result that we experience may differ materially from our estimate during our annual assessment of the useful life of our property plant and equipment we determined that the estimated useful life of machinery and equipment in our wafer fabrication facility should be increased from to year because the lengthening of the process technology cadence resulted in longer node transition on both nanometer nm and product we have also increased the re use of machinery and tool across each generation of process technology this change in estimate wa applied prospectively effective at the beginning of during this change increased our operating income by approximately billion our net income by approximately million and our diluted earnings per share by approximately note accounting policy revenue recognitionwe recognize net product revenue when the earnings process is complete and the risk and reward of product ownership have transferred to our customer evidenced by the existence of an agreement delivery occurred pricing being deemed fixed and collection being considered probable we record pricing allowance including discount based on contractual arrangement with customer when we recognize revenue reduction to both account receivable and net revenue on sale made to distributor that allow for price protection or right of return until the distributor sell through the merchandise we defer product revenue and related cost of sale due to sale price reduction and rapid technology obsolescence in our industry the right of return granted generally consists of stock rotation program in which distributor are able to exchange certain product based on the number of qualified purchase made by the distributor under the price protection program we give distributor credit for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer we include shipping charge billed to customer in net revenue and include the related shipping cost in cost of sale we make payment to our customer through cooperative advertising program such our intel inside program for marketing activity for certain of our product we accrue cooperative advertising obligation and record the cost at the same time that the related revenue is recognized we record cooperative advertising cost marketing general and administrative mg expense to the extent that an advertising benefit separate from the revenue transaction can be identified and the fair value of that advertising benefit received is determinable we record any excess in cash paid to customer over the fair value of the advertising benefit we receive reduction in revenue during the first half of our cooperative advertising cost under the intel inside program met the criterion to be recorded mg during the second half of we transitioned customer from previous offering under the intel inside program to cooperative advertising offering more tailored to customer and their marketing audience in the second half of cooperative advertising cost were recorded reduction of revenue we no longer met the criterion for recording these expense within mg financial statement note to financial of contentsinventorieswe compute inventory cost on first in first basis our process and product development life cycle corresponds with substantive engineering milestone these engineering milestone are regularly and consistently applied in assessing the point at which our activity and associated cost change in nature from research and development to cost of sale and when cost of sale can be capitalized inventory for product to be manufactured in high volume and sold to our customer under our standard warranty it must meet our rigorous technical quality specification this milestone is known product release qualification prq we have identified prq the point at which the cost incurred to manufacture our product are included in the valuation of inventory prior to prq cost that do not meet the criterion for are included in cost of sale in the period incurred if the point at which we estimate that inventory meet prq criterion change in the future the timing and recognition of cost would shift between inventory and and cost of sale single prq ha previously ranged up to million and is dependent on product type the valuation of inventory includes determining which fixed production overhead cost can be included in inventory based on the normal capacity of our manufacturing and assembly and test facility we apply our historical loading compared to our total available capacity in statistical model to determine our normal capacity level if the factory loading are below the established normal capacity level portion of our fixed production overhead cost would not be included in the cost of inventory instead it would be recognized cost of sale in that period we refer to these cost excess capacity charge excess capacity charge are insignificant in the year presented charge in certain prior year have ranged from million to billion the high end of the range would be million when excluding the billion charge taken in connection with the economic recession inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value based upon assumption about future demand and market condition product specific fact and circumstance reviewed in the inventory valuation process include review of our customer base the stage of the product life cycle and an assessment of selling price in relation to product cost inventory reserve increased by approximately million in compared to the valuation of inventory also requires to estimate obsolete and excess inventory well inventory that is not of saleable quality we use the demand forecast to develop our short term manufacturing plan to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decision we compare the estimate of future demand to work in process and finished good inventory level to determine the amount if any of obsolete or excess inventory if our demand forecast for specific product is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly we could be required to write off inventory property plant and equipmentwe compute depreciation using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of asset we also capitalize interest on borrowing related to eligible capital expenditure capitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified asset and depreciated together with that asset cost we record capital related government grant earned reduction to property plant and equipment annually we evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of our property plant and equipment considering factor such the process technology cadence between node transition change in machinery and equipment technology and re use of machinery and tool across each generation of process technology we make manufacturing process conversion and other factory planning decision we use assumption involving the use of management judgment regarding the remaining useful life of asset primarily process specific semiconductor manufacturing tool and building improvement when we determine that the useful life of asset are shorter or longer than we had originally estimated we adjust the rate of depreciation to reflect the asset revised useful life we ass property plant and equipment for impairment when event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of the asset or the asset grouping may not be recoverable factor that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of business or product line in relation to expectation significant negative industry or economic trend and significant change or planned change in our use of the asset we measure the recoverability of asset that we will continue to use in our operation by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flow arising from the use of that asset grouping if an asset grouping carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flow the asset grouping is considered to be impaired we measure the impairment by comparing the difference between the asset grouping carrying value and it fair value we may have certain facility included within construction in progress being held in safe state and not currently in use that we plan to place into service at future date the time at which these asset are placed into service depends on our existing manufacturing capacity market demand for our product and where we are in the transition of product on our roadmap management make judgment about the timing of when these facility will be readied for their intended use and placed into service for the manufacturing of our product depreciation is not recognized on these asset and they are not eligible for capitalized interest when construction is on hold financial

would use when pricing the asset or liability our financial asset are measured and recorded at fair value except for cost method investment cost method loan receivable equity method investment grant receivable and reverse repurchase agreement with original maturity greater than three month the three level of input that may be used to measure fair value are level quoted price in active market for

liability quoted price in le active market or model derived valuation all significant input used in our valuation such discounted cash flow are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability we use libor based yield curve currency spot and forward rate and credit rating significant input in

corroborate them with quoted market price for similar instrument or compare them to output from internally developed pricing model such discounted cash flow model level unobservable input to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of asset or liability we monitor and review the input and result of these valuation model to help ensure the fair value

debt instrument when the interest rate and foreign currency risk are not hedged at the inception of the investment or when our criterion for designation trading asset are not met we record the interest income and realized gain or loss on the sale of these instrument in interest and other net marketable equity security when there is no plan to sell or hedge the investment at the time of original classification we acquire these equity security to promote business and strategic objective we record the realized gain or loss on the sale or exchange of marketable equity security in gain

for cost method investment the carrying value of our non marketable equity investment portfolio totaled billion of december billion of december and is included in other long term asset financial statement note to financial of contentsour quarterly impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factor that may have significant impact on the investee fair value qualitative factor considered include industry and market condition the financial performance and near term prospect of the investee and other relevant event and factor affecting the investee we prepare quarterly quantitative assessment of the fair value of our non marketable equity investment using both the market and income approach which require judgment and the use of estimate including discount rate investee revenue and cost and comparable market data of private and public company among others other than temporary impairmentour available for sale debt security marketable equity security and non marketable equity investment are subject to periodic impairment review for available for sale debt security we consider whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of it amortized cost basis or whether recovery of the entire amortized cost basis of the security is unlikely because credit loss exists when we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security we separate other than temporary impairment into amount representing credit loss which are recognized in interest and other net and amount not related to credit loss which are recognized in other comprehensive income loss for marketable equity security we consider the severity and duration of the decline in fair value below cost and our ability and intent to hold the security for sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of value in the foreseeable future based on the financial health of and business outlook for the investee for non marketable

financial instrumentsour primary objective for holding derivative financial instrument is to manage currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk and to lesser extent equity market risk commodity price risk and credit risk we enter into master netting arrangement to mitigate credit risk in derivative transaction by permitting net settlement of transaction with the same counterparty master netting arrangement allows counterparties to net settle amount owed to each other result of multiple separate derivative transaction we also enter into collateral security arrangement with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivative instrument fluctuates from contractually established threshold we record the collateral within current other asset and long term other asset with corresponding liability for presentation on our consolidated balance sheet we do not offset fair value amount recognized for derivative instrument under

reclassified to interest and other net these derivative are classified in the consolidated statement of cash flow in the same section the underlying item fair value hedgeswe use interest rate contract such interest rate swap to hedge against change in the fair value on certain of our fixed rate indebtedness attributable to change in the benchmark interest rate the gain or loss on these hedge well the offsetting loss or gain related to the change in the fair value of the underlying hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current period primarily in interest

note to financial of contentsnon designated hedgeswe use foreign currency contract to economically hedge the functional currency equivalent cash flow of recognized monetary asset and liability non dollar denominated debt instrument classified trading asset and non dollar denominated loan receivables recognized at fair value we also use interest rate contract to hedge interest rate risk related to our dollar denominated fixed rate debt instrument classified trading asset the change in fair value of these derivative is recorded through earnings in the line item on the consolidated statement of income to which the derivative most closely relate primarily in interest and other net change in the fair value of the underlying asset and liability associated with the hedged risk are generally offset by the change in the fair value of the related derivative loan receivablewe elect the fair value option when the interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate risk is economically hedged at the inception of the loan with related derivative instrument when the fair value option is not elected the loan are carried at amortized cost we measure interest income for all loan receivable using the interest method which is based on the effective yield of the loan rather than the stated coupon rate we classify our loan within other current and long term asset credit riskfinancial instrument that potentially subject to concentration of credit risk consist principally of investment in debt instrument derivative financial instrument loan receivable reverse repurchase agreement and trade receivables we enter into master netting arrangement to mitigate credit risk in derivative transaction by permitting net settlement of transaction with the same counterparty we generally place investment with high credit quality counterparties and by policy we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of that counterparty relative credit standing required per our investment policy substantially all of our investment in debt instrument and financing receivables are in investment grade instrument credit rating criterion for derivative instrument are similar to those for other investment due to master netting arrangement the amount subject to credit risk related to derivative instrument are generally limited to the amount if any by which the counterparty obligation exceed our obligation with that counterparty of december our total credit exposure to any single counterparty excluding money market fund invested in treasury and agency security and reverse repurchase agreement collateralized by treasury and agency security did not exceed million to further reduce credit risk we obtain and secure available collateral from counterparties against obligation including security lending transaction when we deem it appropriate substantial majority of our trade receivables are derived from sale to original equipment manufacturer and original design manufacturer we also have account receivable derived from sale to industrial and communication equipment manufacturer in the computing and communication industry we believe that the net account receivable balance from our three largest customer in do not represent significant credit risk based on cash flow forecast balance sheet analysis and past collection experience for more information about the customer that represent our account receivable balance see note operating segment we have adopted credit policy and standard intended to accommodate industry growth and inherent risk we believe that credit risk are moderated by the financial stability of our major customer we ass credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis from this analysis we establish shipping and credit limit and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection device such obtaining parent guarantee standby letter of credit or credit insurance business combinationswe allocate the purchase price paid for asset acquired and liability assumed in connection with our acquisition based on their estimated fair value at the time of acquisition this allocation involves number of assumption estimate and judgment that could materially affect the timing or amount recognized in our financial statement the most subjective area include determining the fair value of the following intangible asset including the valuation methodology estimation of future cash flow discount rate market segment growth rate our assumed market segment share well the estimated useful life of intangible asset deferred tax asset and liability uncertain tax position and tax related valuation allowance which are initially estimated of the acquisition date inventory property plant and equipment pre existing liability or legal claim deferred revenue and contingent consideration each may be applicable and goodwill measured the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair value of the asset acquired and the liability assumed our assumption and estimate are based upon comparable market data and information obtained from our management and the management of the acquired company we allocate goodwill to the reporting unit of the business that are expected to benefit from the business combination financial statement note to financial of contentsgoodwillwe perform an annual impairment assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if indicator of potential impairment exist the analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factor to ass the likelihood of an impairment the reporting unit carrying value used in an impairment test represents the assignment of various asset and liability excluding certain corporate asset and liability such cash investment and debt qualitative factor include industry and market consideration overall financial performance and other relevant event and factor affecting the reporting unit additionally part of this assessment we may perform quantitative analysis to support the qualitative factor above by applying sensitivity to assumption and input used in measuring reporting unit fair value our quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate reporting unit fair value significant estimate include market segment growth rate our assumed market segment share estimated cost and discount rate based on reporting unit weighted average cost of capital we test the reasonableness of the input and outcome of our discounted cash flow analysis against available market data in the current year the fair value for all of our reporting unit substantially exceeds their carrying value and our annual qualitative assessment did not indicate that more detailed quantitative analysis wa necessary identified intangible assetswe amortize acquisition related intangible asset that are subject to amortization over their estimated useful life acquisition related in process asset represent the fair value of incomplete project that had not reached technological feasibility of the date of acquisition initially these are classified in process and are not subject to amortization these project are completed the asset balance are transferred from in process to acquisition related developed technology and are subject to amortization from this point forward the asset balance relating to project that are abandoned after acquisition are impaired and expensed to we perform quarterly review of significant finite lived identified intangible asset to determine whether fact and circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable these review can be affected by various factor including external factor such industry and economic trend and internal factor such change in our business strategy and our forecast for specific product line employee equity incentive planswe use the straight line amortization method to recognize share based compensation over the service period of the award net of estimated forfeiture upon exercise cancellation forfeiture or expiration of stock option or upon vesting or forfeiture of restricted stock unit rsus we eliminate deferred tax asset for option and rsus with multiple vesting date for each vesting period on first in first out basis if each vesting period were separate award income taxeswe compute the provision for income tax using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax asset and liability are recognized for the expected future tax consequence of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax base of asset and liability and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we measure deferred tax asset and liability using the currently enacted tax rate that apply to taxable income in effect for the year in which those tax asset are expected to be realized or settled we ass the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax asset if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for tax by recording valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax asset recorded on our consolidated balance sheet recovery of portion of our deferred tax asset is affected by management plan with respect to holding or disposing of certain investment therefore such change could also affect our future provision for tax we recognize tax benefit from uncertain tax position only if based on the technical merit of the position it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the tax authority the tax benefit recognized in the financial statement from such position are measured based on the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement we recognize interest and penalty related to unrecognized tax benefit within the provision for tax on the consolidated statement of income we have recorded provisional estimate associated with the december enactment of the tax cut and job act tax reform the sec ha provided accounting and reporting guidance that allows to report provisional amount within measurement period up to one year due to the complexity inherent in adopting the change we consider both the recognition of the transition tax and the remeasurement of deferred income tax incomplete new guidance from regulator interpretation of the law and refinement of our estimate from ongoing analysis of data and tax position may change the provisional amount financial statement note to financial of contentsthe transition tax is based on our total post foreign earnings and profit that were previously deferred from taxation we have not yet completed our substantiation of the underlying data and therefore our taxable base estimate may change our estimate of foreign tax credit may also change we substantiate tax credit claimed further the transition tax is based in part on the amount of foreign earnings held in cash and other liquid asset the transition tax may change we more precisely calculate amount held in liquid and illiquid asset at the various measurement date if the final tax outcome of these matter is different than provisional amount it will impact the provision for income tax and the effective tax rate in the period recorded for more information about tax reform impact see note income tax we recognize the tax impact of including certain foreign earnings in taxable income period cost we have not recognized deferred income tax for local country income and withholding tax that could
