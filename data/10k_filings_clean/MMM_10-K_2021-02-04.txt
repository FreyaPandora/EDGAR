company measure the present value of these future benefit by projecting benefit payment cash flow for each future period and discounting these cash flow back to the december measurement date using the yield of table of contentsportfolio of high quality fixed income debt instrument that would produce cash flow sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefit service cost and interest cost are measured separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation service cost are determined based on duration specific spot rate applied to the service cost cash flow the interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration specific spot rate to the year by year projected benefit payment the spot yield curve approach doe not affect

determined discount rate for it plan follow qualified pension international pension weighted average postretirement medical december liability benefit obligation net periodic benefit cost component

note for information on how the rate were determined follows asc fair value measurement and disclosure in determining the fair value of plan asset within the company pension and postretirement benefit plan while the company belief the valuation method used to determine the fair value of plan asset are appropriate and consistent with other market participant the use of different methodology or assumption to determine the fair value of certain financial instrument could result in different estimate of fair value at the reporting date see note for additional discussion of actuarial assumption

assessment of long lived asset and goodwill acquisition of certain identifiable definite lived and indefinite lived asset in conjunction with an acquisition of business the company record identifiable definite lived and indefinite lived intangible asset acquired at their respective fair value of the date of acquisition the corresponding fair value estimate for these asset acquired include projected future cash flow associated discount rate used to calculate present value asset life cycle royalty rate and customer retention rate the fair value calculated for indefinite lived intangible asset such certain tradenames in addition to intangible asset that are definite lived such patent customer relationship tradenames and other technology based asset may change during the finalization of the purchase price allocation due to the significant estimate used in determining their fair value result the company may make adjustment to the provisional amount recorded for certain item part of the

december net property plant and equipment totaled billion and net identifiable intangible asset totaled billion of which billion related to indefinite lived tradenames in addition goodwill totaled approximately billion of december long lived asset with definite life are tested for impairment whenever event or circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset asset group may not be recoverable an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flow from the asset or asset group ongoing use and eventual disposition if an impairment is identified the amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset carrying value over it fair value fair value is generally determined using discounted cash flow analysis intangible asset with an indefinite life namely certain tradenames are not amortized indefinite lived intangible asset are tested for impairment annually and are tested for impairment between annual test if an event occurs or circumstance change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired an impairment loss would be recognized when the fair value is le than the carrying value of the indefinite lived intangible asset goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year further discussed below and is tested between annual test if an event occurs or circumstance change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired if future non cash asset impairment charge are taken would expect that only portion of the long lived asset or goodwill would be impaired management make estimate and assumption in preparing the consolidated financial statement for which actual result will emerge over long period of time this includes the recoverability of long lived asset employed in the business including asset of acquired business these estimate and assumption are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted circumstance warrant for instance expected asset life may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group factor which could result in future impairment charge include among others change in worldwide economic condition change in competitive condition and customer preference and fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate these risk factor are discussed in item risk factor of this document in addition change in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing result of december the billion of indefinite lived tradenames primarily relates to capital safety acquired in whose tradenames million at acquisition date have been in existence for over year refer to note for more detail the primary valuation technique used in estimating the fair value of indefinite lived intangible asset tradenames is discounted cash flow approach specifically relief of royalty rate is applied to estimated sale with the resulting amount discounted using an appropriate market technology discount rate the relief of royalty rate is the estimated royalty rate market participant would pay to acquire the right to market produce the product in the first quarter of reflected an immaterial charge related to impairment of certain indefinite lived asset in based on annual impairment testing in the third quarter of no additional impairment wa indicated goodwill totaled approximately billion of december annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of each year impairment testing for goodwill is done at reporting unit level with all goodwill assigned to reporting unit reporting unit are one level below the business segment level but are required to be combined when reporting unit table of contentswithin the same segment have similar economic characteristic at reporting unit correspond to division not combine any of it reporting unit for impairment testing an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit net asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and the loss would equal that difference the estimated fair value of reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by price earnings ratio for comparable industry group or by using discounted cash flow analysis typically us the price earnings ratio approach for stable and growing business that have long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flow us the discounted cash flow approach for start up loss position and declining business in addition to using for business where the price earnings ratio valuation method indicates additional review is warranted also us discounted cash flow an additional tool for business that may be growing at slower rate than planned due to economic or other condition where applicable us weighted average discounted cash flow analysis for certain division using projected cash flow that were weighted based on different sale growth and terminal value assumption among other factor the weighting wa based on management estimate of the likelihood of each scenario occurring described in note effective in the first quarter of the company changed it business segment reporting for any product change that resulted in reporting unit change the company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting unit the result of which were immaterial in conjunction with the change in segment reporting completed an assessment indicating no goodwill impairment existed result of this new segment structure the discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter annual impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of no goodwill impairment wa indicated for any of the reporting unit of october had primary reporting unit with ten reporting unit accounting for approximately percent of the goodwill these ten reporting unit were comprised of the following division advanced material display material and system electronics material solution health information system industrial adhesive and tape medical solution oral care solution personal safety separation and purification science and transportation safety is highly integrated enterprise where business share technology and leverage common fundamental strength and capability thus many of business could not easily be sold on stand alone basis focus on research and development ha resulted in portion of value being comprised of internally developed business that have no goodwill associated with them will continue to monitor it reporting unit and asset group in for any triggering event or other indicator of impairment uncertainty in income tax position the extent of operation involves dealing with uncertainty and judgment in the application of complex tax regulation in multitude of jurisdiction the final tax paid are dependent upon many factor including negotiation with taxing authority in
