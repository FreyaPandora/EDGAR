international competitor who are intent on increasing their market share such airbus and other entrant from russia china and japan we are focused on improving our process and continuing cost reduction effort we intend to continue to compete with other airplane manufacturer by providing customer with greater value product bd face strong competition in all market segment primarily from lockheed martin corporation northrop grumman corporation raytheon technology corporation general dynamic corporation and spacex non company such bae system and airbus group continue to build strategic presence in the market by strengthening their north american operation and partnering with defense company in addition certain competitor have occasionally formed team with other competitor to address specific customer requirement bd expects the trend of strong competition to continue into the commercial and defense service market are extremely challenging and are made up of many of the strong and non competitor facing bca and bd along with other competitor in those market bgs leverage our extensive service network offering product and service which span the life cycle of our defense and commercial airplane program training fleet service and logistics maintenance and engineering modification and upgrade well the daily cycle of gate to gate operation bgs expects the market to remain highly competitive in and intends to grow market share by leveraging high level of customer satisfaction and productivity regulatory mattersour business are heavily regulated in most of our market we deal with numerous government agency and entity including but not limited to all of the branch of the military nasa the federal aviation administration faa and the department of homeland security similar government authority exist in our non market government contract the government and other government may terminate any of our government contract at their convenience well for default based on our failure to meet specified performance requirement if any of our government contract were to be terminated for convenience we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation cost if any of our government contract were to be terminated for default generally the government would pay only for the work that ha been accepted and could require to pay the difference the original contract price and the cost to re procure the contract item net of the work accepted from the original contract the government can also hold liable for damage resulting from the default commercial aircraft in the our commercial aircraft product are required to comply with faa regulation governing production and quality system airworthiness and installation approval repair procedure and continuing operational safety outside the similar requirement exist for airworthiness installation and operational approval these requirement are generally administered by the national aviation authority of each country and in the case of europe coordinated by the european union aviation safety agency environmental we are subject to various federal state local and non law and regulation relating to environmental protection including the discharge treatment storage disposal and of contentsremediation of hazardous substance and waste we continually ass our compliance status and management of environmental matter to ensure our operation are in compliance with all applicable environmental law and regulation investigation remediation and operation and maintenance cost associated with environmental compliance and management of site are normal recurring part of our operation these cost often are allowable cost under our contract with the government it is reasonably possible that cost incurred to ensure continued environmental compliance could have material impact on our result of operation financial condition or cash flow if additional work requirement or more stringent clean up standard are imposed by regulator new area of soil air and groundwater contamination are discovered and or expansion of work scope are prompted by the result of investigation potentially responsible party prp ha joint and several liability under existing environmental law where we have been designated prp by the environmental protection agency or state environmental agency we are potentially liable to the government or third party for the full cost of remediating contamination at our facility or former facility or at third party site if we were required to fully fund the remediation of site for which we were originally assigned partial share the statutory framework would allow to pursue right to contribution from other prps for additional information relating to environmental contingency see note to our consolidated financial statement non sale our non sale are subject to both and non governmental regulation and procurement policy and practice including regulation relating to import export control tariff investment exchange control anti corruption and repatriation of earnings non sale are also subject to varying currency political and economic risk raw material part and subassemblieswe are highly dependent on the availability of essential material part and subassemblies from our supplier and subcontractor the most important raw material required for our aerospace product are aluminum sheet plate forging and extrusion titanium sheet plate forging and extrusion and composite including carbon and boron although alternative source generally exist for these raw material qualification of the source could take year or more many major component and product equipment item are procured or subcontracted on sole source basis with number of company supplierswe are dependent upon the ability of large number of and non supplier and subcontractor to meet performance specification quality standard and delivery schedule at our anticipated cost while we maintain an extensive qualification and performance surveillance system to control risk associated with such reliance on third party failure of supplier or subcontractor to meet commitment could adversely affect production schedule and program contract profitability thereby jeopardizing our ability to fulfill commitment to our customer we are also dependent on the

differ materially from our past or projected future performance we urge investor to consider carefully the risk factor described below in evaluating the information contained in this report risk related to covid face significant risk related to the spread of the covid virus and development surrounding the global pandemic have had and will continue to have significant effect on our business financial condition result of operation and cash flow we also face significant risk related to the global economic downturn and severe reduction in commercial air traffic caused by the pandemic these risk include materially reduced demand for our product and service increased instability in our supply chain and challenge to the ongoing viability of of our customer we may face similar risk in connection with any future public health crisis including resurgence in the spread of covid the covid pandemic ha subjected our business operation financial performance cash flow and financial condition to number of risk including but not limited to those discussed below operation related risk result of the covid pandemic we are facing increased operational challenge from the need to protect employee health and safety these challenge have included and may in the future include production site shutdown and workplace disruption and restriction on the movement of people raw material and good both at our own facility and those of our customer and supplier for example during the second quarter of we temporarily suspended operation in puget sound south carolina and philadelphia well at several other key production site we had not previously experienced complete suspension of our operation at these production site while we have resumed operation at all of our production site we can not predict whether or where further production disruption could be required or the ongoing impact of covid related operating restriction will be for example we continue to experience additional operating cost due to social distancing requirement and other factor related to covid restriction we can not predict the impact that future production disruption may have on our business operation financial performance and financial condition we continue to monitor federal state and municipal health authority for new or modified guidance and requirement concerning the covid pandemic and we may be required to impose additional operational restriction and or suspend operation at key production site based on these requirement and recommendation and or workplace disruption caused by covid many of our supplier also were required to suspend operation during the second quarter of and they may experience additional disruption in any such disruption could have severe adverse impact on our production cost delivery schedule and or ability to meet customer commitment any prolonged suspension of operation or delayed recovery in our operation and or any similar suspension of operation or delayed recovery at one or more of our key supplier or the failure of any of our key supplier would result in further challenge to our business leading to further material adverse effect on our business financial condition result of operation and cash flow liquidity risk the covid pandemic ha also had significant impact on our liquidity and overall debt level during the year ended december net cash used by operating activity wa billion at december cash and short term investment totaled billion our debt balance totaled billion at december up from billion at december we expect negative operating cash flow in future quarter delivery begin to return to historical level and if of contentsthe pace and scope of the recovery are worse than we currently contemplate we may need to obtain additional financing in order to fund our operation and obligation if we were to need to obtain additional financing uncertainty related to covid and it impact on and the aerospace industry well continued uncertainty with respect to our credit rating could limit our access to credit market and we may have difficulty obtaining financing on term acceptable to or at all in addition certain of our customer may also be unable to make timely payment to factor that could limit our access to additional liquidity include further disruption in the global capital market and or additional decline in our financial performance outlook or credit rating the occurrence of any or all of these event could adversely affect our ability to fund our operation and or meet outstanding debt obligation and contractual commitment in addition further downgrade in our credit rating could adversely affect our cost of fund and related margin liquidity competitive position and access to capital market and significant downgrade could have an adverse impact on our business customer related risk commercial air traffic ha fallen dramatically due to the covid pandemic this trend ha impacted passenger traffic most severely near term cargo traffic ha also fallen but to lesser extent global trade ha begun to recover most airline have significantly reduced their capacity and many could implement further reduction in the near future many airline are also implementing significant reduction in staffing these capacity change are causing and are expected to continue to cause negative impact to our customer revenue earnings and cash flow and in some case may threaten the future viability of some of our customer potentially causing default within our customer financing portfolio which wa billion of december and or requiring to remarket aircraft that have already been produced and or are currently in backlog if we are unable to successfully remarket these aircraft and or the narrow body and wide body market do not recover soon we are currently assuming or if we are required to further reduce production rate and or contract the accounting quantity on any of our commercial program we could experience material reduction in earnings and or be required to recognize reach forward loss on one or more of our program for example in the fourth quarter of we recognized reach forward loss on the program in part due to impact related to the covid pandemic in addition if max aircraft in one or more jurisdiction remain grounded for an extended period of time we may experience additional reduction to backlog and or significant order cancellation additionally we may experience fewer new order and increased cancellation across all of our commercial airplane program result of the covid pandemic and associated impact on demand our customer may also lack sufficient liquidity to purchase new aircraft due to impact from the pandemic we are also observing significant increase in the number of request for payment deferral contract modification lease restructurings and similar action and these trend may lead to additional charge impairment and other adverse financial impact in our business over time in addition to the extent that customer have valid right to cancel undelivered aircraft we may be required to refund pre delivery payment putting additional constraint on our liquidity in addition to the near term impact there is risk that the industry implement longer term strategy involving reduced capacity shifting route pattern and mitigation strategy related to impact from covid and the risk of future public health crisis in addition airline may experience reduced demand due to reluctance by the flying public to travel due to travel restriction and or social distancing requirement result there is significant uncertainty with respect to when commercial air traffic level will begin to recover and whether and at what point capacity will return to and or exceed pre covid level the covid pandemic also ha increased and it aftermath is also expected to continue to increase uncertainty with respect to global trade volume which could put negative pressure on cargo traffic level any of these factor would have significant impact on the demand for both single aisle and wide body commercial aircraft well for the service we provide to commercial airline in addition lengthy period of reduced industry wide demand for commercial aircraft would put additional pressure on our supplier resulting in increased procurement cost and or additional supply chain disruption to of contentsthe extent that the covid pandemic or it aftermath further impact demand for our product and service or impairs the viability of some of our customer and or supplier our financial condition result of operation and cash flow could be adversely affected and those impact could be material other risk the magnitude and duration of the global covid pandemic is uncertain and continues to adversely affect our business and operating and financial result for example during the fourth quarter of due in part to the prolonged adverse impact of the pandemic on our earnings we recorded an increase of billion to the valuation allowance associated with deferred income tax asset the pandemic also is expected to heighten many of the other risk described below further the covid pandemic may also affect our operating and financial result in manner that is not presently known to or that we currently do not expect to present significant risk to our operation or financial result risk related to our business and operationswe are subject to number of risk and uncertainty related to the max these risk include uncertainty regarding the timing and condition of max regulatory approval in certain non jurisdiction lower than planned production rate and or delivery rate increased consideration to customer increased supplier cost and supply chain health change to the assumption and estimate made in our financial statement regarding the program and potential outcome of various max related legal proceeding and government investigation on march the federal aviation administration faa issued an order to suspend operation of all max aircraft in the and by aircraft operator following two fatal max accident non civil aviation authority issued directive to the same effect delivery of the max were suspended until december the grounding ha reduced revenue operating margin and cash flow and will continue to do until production rate return to pre grounding level in connection with the effort to return the max to service we developed software update for the max together with an associated pilot training and supplementary education program we continue to work with certain non civil aviation authority to complete remaining step toward certification and readiness for return to service worldwide any delay in certification in one or more jurisdiction and or the ramp up of delivery or other liability associated with the accident or grounding could have material adverse effect on our financial position result of operation and or cash flow in addition multiple legal action have been filed related to the max we also are fully cooperating with government investigation related to the accident and the max including investigation by the security and exchange commission in january we entered into deferred prosecution agreement with the department of justice that resolve the department of justice previously disclosed investigation into regarding the evaluation of the max airplane by the faa we expensed in the fourth quarter of related to this agreement any further adverse impact related to any such litigation or investigation could have further material impact on our financial position result of operation and or cash flow during we announced plan to reduce and ultimately to suspend production impact related to these action significantly increased cost to produce aircraft included in the current accounting quantity and have resulted in reduced program and overall bca segment operating margin we have also made significant assumption regarding estimated cost expected to be incurred in that should be included in program inventory and those estimated cost that will be expensed when incurred abnormal production cost if we are unable to return the max aircraft to service in one or more jurisdiction or deliver aircraft to customer on the schedule and or at pace consistent with our expectation we will incur significant additional cost and or delay the planned ramp up of production these delay would also result in significant additional disruption to the production system and further delay effort to restore and or implement previously planned increase in the of contentsproduction rate cash flow continue to be negatively impacted by delayed payment from customer higher cost and inventory level and payment made to customer in connection with disruption to their operation in addition we have experienced claim and assertion from customer in connection with the grounding and we recorded an earnings charge of million net of insurance recovery of million in in connection with an estimate of potential concession and other consideration to customer for disruption related to the grounding and associated delivery delay any further delay in regulatory approval of the max in one or more jurisdiction further disruption to supplier and or the long term health of the production system supplier claim or assertion or change to estimated concession or other consideration we expect to provide to customer could have material adverse effect on our financial position result of operation and or cash flow in the event of unanticipated additional training requirement in one or more jurisdiction delay in regulatory approval and or delay in our ability to resume delivery to one or more customer we may be required to take action with longer term impact such further change to our production plan employment reduction and or the expenditure of significant resource to support our supply chain and or customer we have made significant estimate with respect to the program regarding the number of unit to be produced the period during which those unit are likely to be produced and the unit expected sale price production cost program tooling and other non recurring cost and routine warranty cost in addition to the estimated timing of the resumption of delivery we have made assumption regarding outcome of accident investigation and other government inquiry timing of future production rate increase timing and sequence of future delivery supply chain health we implement our production plan well outcome of negotiation with customer any change in these estimate and or assumption with respect to the program could have material impact on our financial position result of operation and or cash flow for additional information see our discussion under management discussion and analysis critical accounting policy and estimate max grounding on page in addition to the impact of covid described above our commercial airplane and global service business depend heavily on commercial airline and are subject to unique risk market condition have significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft and related service the commercial aircraft market is predominantly driven by long term trend in airline passenger and cargo traffic the principal factor underlying long term traffic growth are sustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging market demand for our commercial aircraft is further influenced by airline profitability availability of aircraft financing world trade policy government to government relation technological advance price and other competitive factor fuel price terrorism epidemic and environmental regulation traditionally the airline industry ha been cyclical and competitive and ha experienced significant profit swing and constant challenge to be more cost competitive significant deterioration in the global economic environment the airline industry generally or the financial stability of one or more of our major customer could result in fewer new order for aircraft or service or could cause customer to seek to postpone or cancel contractual order and or payment to which could result in lower revenue profitability and cash flow and reduction in our contractual backlog in addition our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over period of several year any of these macroeconomic industry or customer impact could unexpectedly affect delivery over long period we enter into firm fixed price aircraft sale contract with indexed price escalation clause which could subject to loss if we have cost overrun or if increase in our cost exceed the applicable escalation rate commercial aircraft sale contract are often entered into year the aircraft are delivered in order to help account for economic fluctuation between the contract date and delivery date aircraft pricing generally consists of fixed amount modified by price escalation formula of contentsderived from labor commodity and other price index our revenue estimate are based on current expectation with respect to these escalation formula but the actual escalation amount are outside of our control escalation factor can fluctuate significantly from period to period change in escalation amount can significantly impact revenue and operating margin in our commercial airplane business we derive significant portion of our revenue from limited number of commercial airline we can make no assurance that any customer will exercise purchase option fulfill existing purchase commitment or purchase additional product or service from in addition fleet decision airline consolidation or financial challenge involving any of our major commercial airline customer could significantly reduce our revenue and limit our opportunity to generate profit from those customer our commercial airplane business depends on our ability to maintain healthy production system achieve planned production rate target successfully develop new aircraft or new derivative aircraft and meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standard the commercial aircraft business is extremely complex involving extensive coordination and integration with and non supplier highly skilled labor from thousand of employee and other partner and stringent regulatory requirement including the risk of evolving standard for commercial aircraft certification and performance and reliability standard in addition the introduction of new aircraft program and or derivative such the involves increased risk associated with meeting development testing production and certification schedule the program ha also experienced significant disruption due to the grounding of the max and associated suspension of max production for part of result our ability to deliver aircraft on time satisfy regulatory and customer requirement and achieve or maintain applicable program profitability is subject to significant risk for example number of our customer may have contractual remedy including right to reject individual airplane delivery if the actual delivery date is significantly later than the contractual delivery date delay on the max and program have resulted in and may continue to result in customer the right to terminate order and or substitute order for other boeing aircraft we must minimize disruption caused by production change and achieve productivity improvement in order to meet customer demand and maintain our profitability we have previously announced plan to adjust production rate on several of our commercial aircraft program we continue to engage in significant ongoing development testing and production of the aircraft in addition we continue to seek opportunity to reduce the cost of building our aircraft including working with our supplier to reduce supplier cost identifying and implementing productivity improvement and optimizing how we manage inventory if production rate change at any of our commercial aircraft assembly facility are delayed or create significant disruption to our production system or if our supplier can not timely deliver component to at the cost and rate necessary to achieve our target we may be unable to meet delivery schedule and or the financial performance of one or more of our program may suffer operational challenge impacting the production system for one or more of our commercial aircraft program could result in production delay and or failure to meet customer demand for new aircraft either of which would negatively impact our revenue and operating margin our commercial aircraft production system is extremely complex operational issue including delay or defect in supplier component failure to meet internal performance plan or delay or failure to achieve required regulatory approval could result in significant out of sequence work and increased production cost well delayed delivery to customer impact to aircraft performance and or increased warranty or fleet support cost for example in the fourth quarter of we expanded the scope of production inspection on the program and those inspection and associated rework are delaying scheduled delivery and resulting in additional aircraft in inventory of contentsif our commercial airplane fail to satisfy performance and reliability requirement we could face additional cost and or lower revenue developing and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and reliability standard well those of customer and regulatory agency can be costly and technologically challenging these challenge are particularly significant with newer aircraft program any failure of any boeing aircraft to satisfy performance or reliability requirement could result in disruption to our operation higher cost and or lower revenue change in level of government defense spending or overall acquisition priority could negatively impact our financial position and result of operation we derive substantial portion of our revenue from the government primarily from defense related program with the dod level of defense spending are very difficult to predict and may be impacted by numerous factor such the evolving nature of the national security threat environment national security strategy foreign policy the domestic political environment macroeconomic condition and the ability of the government to enact relevant legislation such authorization and appropriation bill although appropriation have been enacted long term uncertainty remains with respect to overall level of defense spending beyond and it is likely that government discretionary spending including defense spending will continue to be subject to pressure in addition the timeliness of future appropriation for government department and agency remains recurrent risk lapse in appropriation for government department or agency would result in full or partial government shutdown which could impact the company operation alternatively congress may fund government department and agency with one or more continuing resolution however this could restrict the execution of certain program activity and delay new program or competition there continues to be uncertainty with respect to future acquisition priority and program level appropriation for the dod and other government agency including nasa including tension between modernization investment sustainment investment and investment in new technology or emergent capability future investment priority change or budget cut including change associated with the authorization and appropriation process could result in reduction cancellation and or delay of existing contract or program or future program opportunity any of these impact could have material effect on the result of the company operation financial position and or cash flow in addition result of the significant ongoing uncertainty with respect to both defense spending and the evolving nature of the national security threat environment we also expect the dod to continue to emphasize affordability innovation cybersecurity and delivery of technical data and software in it procurement process if we can no longer adjust successfully to these changing acquisition policy our revenue and market share could be impacted of contentsour ability to deliver product and service that satisfy customer requirement is heavily dependent on the performance and financial stability of our subcontractor and supplier well on the availability of raw material and other component we rely on other company including and non subcontractor and supplier to provide and produce raw material integrated component and sub assembly and production commodity and to perform some of the service that we provide to our customer if one or more of our supplier or subcontractor experience financial difficulty delivery delay or other performance problem we may be unable to meet commitment to our customer or incur additional cost in addition if one or more of the raw material on which we depend such aluminum titanium or composite becomes unavailable or is available only at very high price we may be unable to deliver one or more of our product in timely fashion or at budgeted cost in some instance we depend upon single source of supply any service disruption from one of these supplier either due to circumstance beyond the supplier control such geopolitical development or result of performance problem or financial difficulty could have material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitment to our customer or increase our operating cost competition within our market and with respect to the product we sell may reduce our future contract and sale the market in which we operate are highly competitive and one or more of our competitor may have more extensive or more specialized engineering manufacturing and marketing capability than we do in some area in our commercial airplane business we anticipate increasing competition among non aircraft manufacturer of commercial jet aircraft in our bd business we anticipate that the effect of defense industry consolidation shifting acquisition and budget priority and continued cost pressure at our dod and non customer will intensify competition for many of our bd product our bgs segment face competition from many of the same strong and non competitor facing bca and bd furthermore we are facing increased international competition and cross border consolidation of competition there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitor or that the competitive pressure we face will not result in reduced revenue and market share we derive significant portion of our revenue from non sale and are subject to the risk of business in other country in non customer which includes foreign military sale fm accounted for approximately of our revenue we expect that non sale will continue to account for significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future result we are subject to risk of doing business internationally including change in regulatory requirement change in the global trade environment including dispute with authority in non jurisdiction including international trade authority that could impact sale and or delivery of product and service outside the and or impose cost on our customer in the form of tariff duty or penalty attributable to the importation of boeing product and service and non government policy including requirement to expend portion of program fund locally and governmental industrial cooperation or participation requirement fluctuation in international currency exchange rate volatility in international political and economic environment and change in non national priority and budget which can lead to delay or fluctuation in order the complexity and necessity of using non representative and consultant of content the uncertainty of the ability of non customer to finance purchase including the availability of financing from the export import bank of the united state uncertainty and restriction concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantee imposition of domestic and international tax export control tariff embargo sanction and other trade restriction the difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise spread over many country compliance with variety of non law well law affecting the activity of company abroad and unforeseen development and condition including terrorism war epidemic and international tension and conflict while the impact of these factor is difficult to predict any one or more of these factor could adversely affect our operation in the future for example since the and china have imposed tariff on each other import china is very significant market for commercial airplane and represents significant component of our commercial airplane backlog in addition the and european union eu have been engaged in two long running dispute at the world trade organization wto relating to large civil aircraft including one that ha resulted in the imposition of tariff on certain of our product impact from these or future potential tariff or deterioration in trade relation between the and one or more other country could have material adverse impact on our revenue operating earnings and or cash flow we use estimate in accounting for many contract and program change in our estimate could adversely affect our future financial result contract and program accounting require judgment relative to assessing risk estimating revenue and cost and making assumption for schedule and technical issue due to the size and nature of many of our contract and program the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variable assumption have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract or program because cost also include expected increase in wage and employee benefit material price and allocated fixed cost incentive or penalty related to performance on contract are considered in estimating sale and profit rate and are recorded when there is sufficient information for to ass anticipated performance supplier claim and assertion are also assessed and considered in estimating cost and profit rate estimate of future award fee are also included in sale and profit rate with respect to each of our commercial aircraft program inventoriable production cost including overhead program tooling and other non recurring cost and routine warranty cost are accumulated and charged cost of sale by program instead of by individual unit or contract program consists of the estimated number of unit accounting quantity of product to be produced in continuing long term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contract limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimate to establish the relationship of sale to cost of sale program accounting requires estimate of the number of unit to be produced and sold in program the period over which the unit can reasonably be expected to be produced and the unit expected sale price production cost program tooling and other non recurring cost and routine warranty cost for the total program several factor determine accounting quantity including firm order letter of intent from prospective customer and market study change to customer or model mix production cost and rate learning curve change to price escalation index cost of derivative aircraft supplier performance customer and supplier negotiation settlement supplier claim and or certification issue can impact these estimate in addition on development program such the we are subject to risk with respect to the timing and condition of aircraft certification including potential gap between when aircraft are certified in various jurisdiction and our estimate with of contentsrespect to timing of future certification could have an impact on overall program status any such change in estimate relating to program accounting may adversely affect future financial performance because of the significance of the judgment and estimation process described above materially different sale and profit amount could be recorded if we used different assumption or if the underlying circumstance were to change change in underlying assumption circumstance or estimate may adversely affect future period financial performance for additional information on our accounting policy for recognizing sale and profit see our discussion under management discussion and analysis critical accounting policy contract accounting program accounting on page and note to our consolidated financial statement on page of this form we may not realize the anticipated benefit of merger acquisition joint venture strategic alliance or divestiture part of our business strategy we may merge with or acquire business and or form joint venture and strategic alliance whether we realize the anticipated benefit from these acquisition and related activity depends in part upon our ability to integrate the operation of the acquired business the performance of the underlying product and service portfolio and the performance of the management team and other personnel of the acquired operation accordingly our financial result could be adversely affected by unanticipated performance issue legacy liability transaction related charge amortization of expense related to intangible charge for impairment of long term asset credit

pursuant to government contract which are subject to unique risk in of our revenue were earned pursuant to government contract which include fm through the government business conducted pursuant to such contract is subject to extensive procurement regulation and other unique risk our sale to the government are subject to extensive procurement regulation and change to those regulation could increase our cost new procurement regulation or change to existing requirement could increase our compliance cost or otherwise have material impact on the operating margin of our bd and bgs business these requirement may result in increased compliance cost and we could be subject to additional cost in the form of withheld payment and or reduced future business if we fail to comply with these requirement in the future compliance cost attributable to current and potential future procurement regulation such these could negatively impact our financial condition and operating result the government may modify curtail or terminate one or more of our contract the government contracting party may modify curtail or terminate it contract and subcontract with without prior notice and either at it convenience or for default based on performance in addition funding pursuant to our government contract may be reduced or withheld part of the of contentscongressional appropriation process due to fiscal constraint change in national security strategy and or priority or other reason further uncertainty with respect to ongoing program could also result in the event that the government finance it operation through temporary funding measure such continuing resolution rather than full year appropriation any loss or anticipated loss or reduction of expected funding and or modification curtailment or termination of one or more large program could have material adverse effect on our earnings cash flow and or financial position we are subject to government inquiry and investigation including periodic audit of cost that we determine are reimbursable under government contract government agency including the defense contract audit agency and the defense contract management agency routinely audit government contractor these agency review our performance under contract cost structure and compliance with applicable law regulation and standard well the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control system and policy any cost found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to specific contract will be deemed non reimbursable and to the extent already reimbursed must be refunded any inadequacy in our system and policy could result in withholds on billed receivables penalty and reduced future business furthermore if any audit inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activity we could be subject to civil and criminal penalty and administrative sanction including termination of contract forfeiture of profit suspension of payment fine and suspension or debarment from doing business with the government we also could suffer reputational harm if allegation of impropriety were made against even if such allegation are later determined to be false we enter into fixed price contract which could subject to loss if we have cost overrun our bd and bgs defense business generated approximately and of their revenue from fixed price contract while fixed price contract enable to benefit from performance improvement cost reduction and efficiency they also subject to the risk of reduced margin or incurring loss if we are unable to achieve estimated cost and revenue if our estimated cost exceed our estimated price we recognize reach forward loss which can significantly affect our reported result for example in we recorded additional reach forward loss of million on the kc tanker contract reflecting million of cost associated with the agreement signed in april with the air force to develop and integrate new remote vision system and the remaining cost reflect production inefficiency including impact of covid disruption new program could also have risk for reach forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance for example in in connection with winning the red hawk and mq competition we recorded loss of million associated with option for red hawk aircraft and loss of million related to the mq engineering manufacturing and development emd contract the long term nature of many of our contract make the process of estimating cost and revenue on fixed price contract inherently risky fixed price contract often contain price incentive and penalty tied to performance which can be difficult to estimate and have significant impact on margin in addition some of our contract have specific provision relating to cost schedule and performance fixed price development contract are generally subject to more uncertainty than fixed price production contract many of these development program have highly complex design in addition technical or quality issue that arise during development could lead to schedule delay and higher cost to complete which could result in material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition example of significant bd fixed price development contract include commercial crew kc tanker red hawk vc presidential aircraft mq and commercial and military satellite of contentswe enter into cost type contract which also carry risk our bd and bgs defense business generated approximately and of their revenue from cost type contracting arrangement some of these are development program that have complex design and technical challenge these cost type program typically have award or incentive fee that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended period in these case the associated financial risk are primarily in reduced fee lower profit rate or program cancellation if cost schedule or technical performance issue arise program whose contract are primarily cost type include ground based midcourse defense gmd proprietary and sl program we enter into contract that include in orbit incentive payment that subject to risk contract in the commercial satellite industry and certain government satellite contract include in orbit incentive payment these in orbit payment may be paid over time after final satellite acceptance or paid in full prior to final satellite acceptance in both case the in orbit incentive payment is at risk if the satellite doe not perform to specification for up to year after acceptance the net present value of in orbit incentive fee we ultimately expect to realize is recognized revenue in the construction period if the satellite fails to meet contractual performance criterion customer will not be obligated to continue making in orbit payment and or we may be required to provide refund to the customer and incur significant charge risk related to

result of operation in addition we are subject to extensive regulation under the law of the united state and it various state well other jurisdiction in which we operate result we are sometimes subject to government inquiry and investigation of our business due among other thing to our business relationship with the government the heavily regulated nature of our industry and in the case of

consolidated financial statement risk related to financing and liquiditywe may be unable to obtain debt to fund our operation and contractual commitment at competitive rate on commercially reasonable term or in sufficient amount we depend in part upon the issuance of debt to fund our operation and contractual commitment in addition our debt balance have increased significantly since driven primarily by impact related to the max grounding and the covid pandemic and we expect to continue to actively manage our liquidity our increased debt balance ha also resulted in downgrade to our

fund outstanding financing commitment or meet other business requirement our market liquidity may not be sufficient these risk will be particularly acute if we are subject to further credit rating downgrade number of factor could cause to incur increased borrowing cost and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private market for debt these factor include disruption or decline in the global capital market and or decline in our financial performance outlook or credit rating including impact described above related to the of contentscovid pandemic and or associated change in demand for our product and service the occurrence of any or all of these event may adversely affect our ability to fund our operation and contractual or financing commitment substantial pension and other postretirement benefit obligation have material impact on our earnings shareholder equity and cash flow from operation and could have significant adverse impact in future period many of our employee have earned benefit under defined benefit pension plan potential pension contribution include both mandatory amount required under the employee retirement income security act and discretionary contribution to improve the plan funded status the extent of future contribution depends heavily on market factor such the discount rate and the actual return on plan asset we estimate future contribution to these plan using assumption with respect to these and other item change to those assumption could have significant effect on future contribution well on our annual pension cost and or result in significant change to shareholder equity for government contract we allocate pension cost to individual contract based on cost accounting standard which can also affect contract profitability we also provide other postretirement benefit to certain of our employee consisting principally of health care coverage for eligible retiree and qualifying dependent our estimate of

by pension and other postretirement plan accounting policy see management discussion and analysis critical accounting policy pension plan on page of this form although under generally accepted accounting principle in the united state of america gaap the timing of periodic pension and other postretirement benefit expense and plan contribution are not directly related the key economic factor that affect gaap expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or stock we would contribute to our plan our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposure we are exposed to liability that are unique to the product and service we provide we maintain insurance for certain risk and in some circumstance we may receive indemnification from the government the amount of our insurance coverage may not cover all claim or liability and we may be forced to bear substantial cost for example liability arising from the use of certain of our product such aircraft technology space system spacecraft satellite missile system weapon cyber security border security system anti terrorism technology and or air traffic management system may not be insurable on commercially reasonable term while some of these product are shielded from liability within the under the safety act provision of the homeland security act no such protection is available outside the

impact of the max grounding continue to have significant adverse impact on our business and are expected to continue to negatively impact revenue earnings and operating cash flow in future quarter they are also having significant impact on our liquidity see liquidity matter in note to our consolidated financial statement for further discussion of liquidity and additional action we are taking in response to these challenge the covid pandemic ha caused an unprecedented shock to demand for air travel creating tremendous challenge for our customer our business and the entire commercial aerospace manufacturing and service sector global economic growth primary driver for air travel is expected to have declined to between and in the latest international air transport association iata forecast projected full year passenger traffic to be more than compared to global economic activity slows due to covid and government severely restricted travel to contain the spread of the virus the recovery remains slow and uneven travel restriction and varying regional travel protocol continue to impact air travel generally we expect domestic travel to recover faster than international travel result we expect the narrow body market to recover faster than the wide body market also the pace of the commercial market recovery will be heavily dependent on covid infection rate progress on testing government travel restriction and timing and availability of vaccine air cargo traffic level contracted this year due to weak global trade growth and capacity limitation given the large impact that covid ha had on international passenger operation which also carry cargo demand for dedicated freighter is developing better relative to cargo traffic trend of contentsairline financial performance which also play role in the demand for new capacity ha been adversely impacted by the covid pandemic according to iata net loss in for the airline industry are expected to be approximately billion compared to net profit of billion in our customer are taking action to combat the effect of the covid pandemic on the market by preserving liquidity this come in many form such deferral of advance and other payment to supplier deferral of delivery reduced spending on service and in some case cancellation of order we face challenging environment in the near to medium term airline adjust to reduced traffic which in turn will lower demand for commercial aerospace product and service the current environment is also affecting the financial viability of some airline we currently expect it will take approximately three year for world wide travel to return to level and few year beyond that for the industry to return to long term trend growth of approximately to balance the supply and demand given the covid shock and to preserve our long term potential and competitiveness we have reduced the production rate of several of our bca program these rate decision are based on our ongoing assessment of the demand environment and availability of aircraft financing there is significant uncertainty with respect to when commercial air traffic level will recover and whether and at what point capacity will return to and or exceed pre covid level during the fourth quarter of we made adjustment to our estimate regarding timing of entry into service and market demand we anticipate that the first delivery will occur in late we will closely monitor the key factor that affect backlog and future demand including customer evolving fleet plan the wide body replacement cycle and the cargo market we will maintain disciplined rate management process and make adjustment appropriate in the future notwithstanding the change we have made to production rate risk remains that further reduction will be required additionally if we are unable to make timely delivery of the large number of aircraft in inventory of december future revenue earnings and cash flow will be adversely impacted the long term outlook for the industry remains positive due to the fundamental driver of air travel demand economic growth increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade globalization and improved airline service driven by liberalization of air traffic right between country the shock from covid ha reduced the near to medium term demand but our commercial market outlook forecast project growth rate for passenger and cargo traffic over year period based on long term global economic growth projection of average annual gdp growth we project demand for approximately new airplane over the next year the industry remains vulnerable to exogenous development including fuel price spike credit market shock act of terrorism natural disaster conflict epidemic pandemic and increased global environmental regulation delivery of the max resumed in the fourth quarter of when the faa rescinded the order that grounded max aircraft in the order to suspend operation of max aircraft from certain non civil aviation authority including the civil aviation administration of china are still in effect the grounding ha had significant adverse impact on our operation and creates significant uncertainty we are focused on safely returning the max to service for all of our customer at bgs we are seeing direct impact on our commercial supply chain business fewer flight and more aircraft retirement result in decreased demand for our part and logistics offering additionally our commercial customer are curtailing discretionary spending such modification and upgrade and focusing on required maintenance similar to bca we expect multi year recovery period for the commercial service business the demand outlook for our government service business which in accounted for under half of bgs revenue remains stable at bd we continue to see healthy market with solid demand for our major platform and program both domestically and internationally however we experienced near term production impact associated with our temporary suspension of operation at various location in of contentsin march and april of result of covid we temporarily suspended operation at multiple location including the puget sound area south carolina and philadelphia operation in puget sound and philadelphia resumed during the week of april while operation in south carolina resumed beginning on may we have implemented procedure to promote employee safety in our facility including more frequent and enhanced cleaning and adjusted schedule and work flow to support physical distancing these action have resulted and will continue to result in increased operating cost in addition number of our supplier have suspended or otherwise reduced their operation and we are experiencing some supply chain shortage our supplier are also experiencing liquidity pressure and disruption to their operation result of covid we also continue to have large number of employee working from home these measure and disruption have reduced overall productivity and adversely impacted our financial position result of operation and cash flow in we expect further adverse impact in future quarter in july we announced our business transformation effort to ass our business across five key pillar infrastructure overhead and organization portfolio and investment supply chain health and operational excellence we continue to make progress across all five key pillar we utilize lower production rate environment to transform and improve our business process within the infrastructure pillar we are assessing our overall facility requirement in light of reduced demand in our commercial business and remote and virtual work opportunity for large number of our workforce the consolidation of the production in south carolina is an example of this we also anticipate reduction of approximately in office space need compared to our current capacity during we made certain reduction to our footprint and are planning to implement further reduction over the next few year however we consolidate our footprint we may incur near term adverse impact to earnings the overhead and organization pillar is focused on our cost structure and how we are organized so we can right size our workforce and simplify and reduce management layer and bureaucracy during we recorded severance cost for approximately employee of which approximately have left the company of december and the remainder are expected to leave in the portfolio and investment pillar includes aligning our portfolio and investment to focus on our core business and the change in market condition through our portfolio and investment prioritization we reduced research and development and capital expenditure during by billion from the prior year the supply chain pillar is focused on supply chain health and stability reducing indirect procurement spend and streamlining our transportation logistics and warehousing approach we reduced indirect spend in by reducing expenditure in area such freight and logistics purchased service and others the operational excellence pillar is focused on improving performance enhancing quality and reducing rework for example our information technology team are evaluating opportunity to form or expand strategic partnership with vendor that allow to simplify and optimize our operation and reduce overall cost these activity are not intended to constrain our capacity but to enable the company to emerge stronger and be more resilient when the market recovers we expect that successful execution of these measure will improve near term

implementation of this agreement is incomplete and overall diplomatic relation between the and china have deteriorated we continue monitoring development for potential adverse impact to the company beginning in june the government ha imposed tariff on steel and aluminum import in response to these tariff several major trading partner have imposed or announced their intention to impose tariff on good in may the government mexico and canada reached an agreement to end the steel and aluminum tariff between these country implementation of the mexico canada free trade agreement usmca will also result in lower tariff we continue to monitor the potential for any extra cost that may result from the remaining global tariff the government continues to impose and or consider imposing sanction on certain business and individual in russia although our operation or sale in russia have not been impacted to date we continue to monitor additional sanction that may be imposed by the government and any response from russia that could affect our supply chain business partner or customer the and european union eu have been engaged in two long running dispute at the world trade organization wto relating to large civil aircraft part of those dispute in october the wto authorized the to impose approximately billion in annual tariff on eu product in connection with the eu provision of eight instance of launch aid subsidy to airbus the is currently imposing tariff on new airbus airplane imported into the well fuselage that airbus manufacture in europe and import into the in october the wto authorized the eu to impose approximately billion in annual tariff on product in connection with tax incentive used by boeing in washington state that ha since been repealed the eu is currently imposing tariff on boeing airplane imported into the eu we will continue to ass and work with our customer on the possible impact of these tariff delivery to european customer are expected to increase

covid shock and subsequent economic impact government restriction and new regulation the commercial airplane market and the airline industry both remain extremely competitive while the impact and response have varied globally the reduction of demand and disruption in production ha adversely impacted most manufacturer in the commercial airplane industry continued access to global market remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sale potential and long term investment return approximately of commercial airplane total backlog in dollar term is with non airline we face aggressive international competitor who are intent on increasing their market share they offer competitive product and have access to most of the same customer and supplier the grounding of the max and the associated suspension of max delivery significantly reduced our market share with respect to delivery of single aisle aircraft in and and may provide competitor with an opportunity to obtain more order and increase market share with government support airbus ha historically invested heavily to create family of product to compete with after the acquisition of majority share of bombardier series now in airbus continues to expand in the seat transcontinental market other competitor are also in different phase of developing commercial jet aircraft some of these competitor have historically enjoyed access to government provided financial support including launch aid which greatly reduces the cost and commercial risk associated with airplane development activity this ha enabled the development of airplane without broad commercial viability others to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible and many offered for sale below market based price competitor continue to make improvement in efficiency which may result in funding product development gaining market share and improving earnings this market environment ha resulted in intense pressure on pricing and other competitive factor and we expect these pressure to continue or intensify in the coming year we are focused on improving our product and service and continuing our business transformation effort which enhances our ability to compete and position for market recovery we are also focused on taking action to ensure that boeing is not harmed by unfair subsidization of competitor of contentsresults of

we made adjustment to our estimate regarding timing of entry into service and market demand previously disclosed market uncertainty driven primarily by the impact of covid resulted in lower planned production rate and created significant pressure on the program revenue and cost estimate while the program did not have reach forward loss of the third quarter of based on our assessment of the probable range of initial accounting quantity and other factor at that time we noted that future level of profitability would be subject to number of factor including continued market uncertainty the impact of covid on our production system well on our supply chain and customer subsequent production rate reduction for both and other commercial program and potential risk associated with the testing program and the timing of certification we now anticipate that the first delivery will occur in late we also recorded billion reach forward loss on the program in the fourth quarter of the revised

management decision to make modification to the aircraft design an updated assessment of covid impact on market demand and discussion with our customer with respect to aircraft delivery timing these factor resulted in adjustment to production rate and the program accounting quantity increased change incorporation cost and associated customer and supply chain impact the timing of the certification

term contract our long term contract typically represent single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying good and or service and the significant service of integration that we provide accounting for long term contract involves judgmental process of estimating the total sale cost and profit for each performance obligation cost of sale is recognized incurred and revenue is determined by adding proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reported cost of sale due to the size duration and nature of many of our long term contract the estimation of total sale and cost through completion is complicated and subject to many variable total sale estimate are based on negotiated contract price and quantity modified by our assumption regarding contract option change order incentive and award provision associated with technical performance and price adjustment clause such inflation or index based clause the majority of these long term contract are with the government where the price is generally based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit federal acquisition regulation provide guidance on the type of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price total cost estimate are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract term historical performance trend business base and other economic projection factor that influence these estimate include inflationary trend technical and schedule risk internal and subcontractor performance trend business volume assumption covid disruption asset utilization and anticipated labor agreement revenue and cost estimate for all significant long term contract performance obligation are reviewed and reassessed quarterly change in these estimate could result in recognition of cumulative catch up adjustment to the performance obligation inception to date revenue cost of sale and profit in the period in which such change are made change in revenue and cost estimate could also result in reach forward loss or an adjustment to reach forward loss which would be recorded immediately in earnings for the year ended december and net unfavorable cumulative catch up adjustment including reach forward loss across all long term contract decreased earnings from operation by million million and million respectively the cumulative catch up adjustment in were primarily due to reach forward loss incurred on the kc tanker program due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above it is likely that materially different earnings could be recorded if we used different assumption or if the underlying circumstance were to change change in underlying assumption estimate supplier performance or circumstance may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future period if the combined gross margin for all long term contract performance obligation for all of had been estimated to be higher or lower by it would have increased or decreased pre tax income for the year by approximately million in addition number of our fixed price development contract are in reach forward loss position change to estimated loss are recorded immediately in earnings program accountingprogram accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sale to cost for the defined program accounting quantity program consists of the estimated number of unit accounting quantity of product to be produced in continuing long term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contract the determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimate of the revenue and cost of existing and of contentsanticipated contract for each program the amount reported cost of sale is determined by applying the estimated cost of sale percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sale recognized for airplane delivered and accepted by the customer factor that must be estimated include program accounting quantity sale price labor and employee benefit cost material cost procured part cost major component cost overhead cost program tooling and other non recurring cost and warranty cost estimation of the accounting quantity for each program take into account several factor that are indicative of the demand for the particular program such firm order letter of intent from prospective customer and market study total estimated program sale are determined by estimating the model mix and sale price for all unsold unit within the accounting quantity added together with the sale price for all undelivered unit under contract the sale price for all undelivered unit within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly cost estimate are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contract with supplier historical performance trend and business base and other economic projection factor that influence these estimate include production rate internal and subcontractor performance trend customer and or supplier claim or assertion asset utilization anticipated labor agreement covid disruption and inflationary or deflationary trend to ensure reliability in our estimate we employ rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on quarterly basis this includes reassessing the accounting quantity change in estimate of program margin are normally recognized on prospective basis however when estimated cost to complete program exceed estimated revenue from undelivered unit in the accounting quantity loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered unit in the accounting quantity the program method of accounting allocates tooling and other non recurring and production cost over the accounting quantity for each program because of the higher unit production cost experienced at the beginning of new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling and other non recurring cost new commercial aircraft program typically have lower initial margin than established program and higher risk for reach forward loss actual cost incurred for earlier unit in excess of the estimated average cost of all unit in the program accounting quantity are included within program inventory deferred production cost deferred production unamortized tooling and other non recurring cost are expected to be fully recovered when all unit in the accounting quantity are delivered the expected unit cost for later delivery is below the estimated average cost learning curve and other improvement are realized we now anticipate that the first delivery will occur in late we also recorded billion reach forward loss on the program in the fourth quarter of the revised schedule and the reach forward loss reflect number of factor including an updated assessment of global certification requirement informed by continued discussion with regulator and resulting in management decision to make modification to the aircraft design an updated assessment of covid impact on market demand and discussion with our customer with respect to aircraft delivery timing these factor resulted in adjustment to production rate and the program accounting quantity increased change incorporation cost and associated customer and supply chain impact absent change in the estimated revenue or cost delivery which are expected to begin in will be recorded at zero margin reduction to the estimated loss in subsequent period are spread over all undelivered unit in the accounting quantity whereas increase to the estimated loss are recorded immediately the level of profitability on the program will be subject to number of factor these factor include continued market uncertainty the impact of covid on our production system well impact on our supply chain and customer further production rate adjustment for the or other commercial aircraft program contraction of the accounting quantity and potential risk associated with the testing program and the timing of aircraft certification one or more of these factor of contentscould result in additional reach forward loss on the program in future period which may be material due to the impact of covid on our customer well production issue and associated rework the program ha near breakeven gross margin at december the margin reflect reduction in the production rate and program accounting quantity during if we are required to further reduce the accounting quantity and or production rate or experience higher than anticipated cost or delay addressing production issue and associated rework or other factor that could result in lower margin the program could record reach forward loss in future period which may be material the and program also have near breakeven gross margin at december if we are unable to mitigate risk associated with these program or if our assumption with respect to item such pricing cost accounting quantity or future production rate were to change we could be required to record reach forward loss in future period which may be material max groundingin following two fatal max accident the federal aviation administration faa and non civil aviation authority issued order suspending commercial operation of max aircraft delivery of the max were suspended following these order delivery resumed in late following rescission by the faa of it grounding order multiple legal action have been filed against result of the accident in addition we are fully cooperating with government investigation related to the accident and the max program including an investigation by the security and exchange commission the outcome of which may be material on january we entered into deferred prosecution agreement with the department of justice that resolve the department of justice previously disclosed investigation into regarding the evaluation of the max airplane by the faa other than with respect to the department of justice we can not reasonably estimate range of loss if any not covered by available insurance that may result given the current status of the lawsuit investigation and inquiry related to the max in the preparation of our financial statement we have made assumption regarding outcome of accident investigation and other government inquiry timing and condition of return to service the timing of future production rate increase supplier readiness to support production rate change timing and sequence of future customer delivery well outcome of negotiation with customer impacted by the grounding we have also made significant assumption regarding estimated cost expected to be incurred in that should be included in program inventory and those cost that should be expensed when incurred abnormal production cost while these assumption reflect our best estimate at this time they are highly uncertain and significantly affect the estimate inherent in our financial statement in december we delivered aircraft in compliance with the faa regulatory requirement we have assumed that the remaining non regulatory approval will occur and enable delivery during the first half of we have approximately airplane in inventory of december number of customer have requested to defer delivery or to cancel order for max aircraft and we are remarketing and or delaying delivery of certain aircraft included within inventory we now expect to deliver about half of the max aircraft in inventory by the end of in the event that we are unable to resume aircraft delivery in non jurisdiction consistent with our assumption of regulatory approval timing our expectation of delivery timing could be impacted due to the grounding and associated suspension of max delivery we temporarily suspended max production beginning in january we resumed early stage of max production in may and continued to produce at low rate through the end of of contentsin addition we reduced the number of aircraft included in the accounting quantity by unit in the first quarter of result of reduction to planned production rate due to covid driven market uncertainty we are producing at abnormally low production rate in and we expect to incur approximately billion of abnormal production cost that are being expensed incurred the slowdown in the planned production rate ramp up increased expected abnormal cost however this increase wa offset by adjustment to the determination of the normal production level due to covid impact on customer demand well cost reduction activity including significant reduction in employment level we expensed approximately billion of abnormal production cost during the year ended december in addition to impact related to the max accident and subsequent grounding the program continues to be significantly impacted by the covid pandemic and it effect on aircraft demand these impact have resulted in lower production and delivery rate assumption we currently expect to gradually increase the production rate to per month by early we currently assume that we will implement further gradual production rate increase in subsequent period based on market demand the ongoing impact of covid on market demand have also created significant uncertainty around the timing of delivery of max aircraft in inventory we may need to recognize additional cost associated with remarketing and or reconfiguring aircraft in inventory which may reduce revenue and or earnings in future period we are working with our customer to minimize the impact to their operation from grounded and undelivered aircraft we continue to reassess the liability for estimated potential concession and other consideration to customer on quarterly basis this reassessment includes updating estimate to reflect revision to return to service delivery and production rate assumption driven by timing of regulatory approval well latest information based on engagement with max customer the remaining liability of billion at december represents our current best estimate of future concession and other consideration to customer and is necessarily based on series of assumption it is subject to change in future quarter negotiation with customer mature and timing and condition of return to service are better understood our assumption reflect our current best estimate but actual timing and condition of return to service and resumption of delivery could differ from this estimate the effect of which could be material we are unable at this time to reasonably estimate potential future additional financial impact or range of loss if any due to continued uncertainty related to the timing and condition of return to service uncertainty related to the impact of covid on our operation supply chain and customer future change to the production rate supply chain impact and or the result of negotiation with particular customer any such impact including any change in our estimate could have material adverse effect on our financial position result of operation and or cash flow for example we expect that in the event that we are unable to resume aircraft delivery in non jurisdiction consistent with our assumption the continued absence of revenue earnings and cash flow associated with max delivery would continue to have material impact on our operating result in the event that future production rate increase occur at slower rate or take longer than we are currently assuming we expect that the growth in inventory and other cash flow impact associated with production would decrease however while any prolonged production suspension or delay in planned production rate increase could mitigate the impact on our liquidity it could significantly increase the overall expected cost to produce aircraft included in the accounting quantity which would reduce program margin and or increase abnormal production cost in the future goodwill impairmentswe test goodwill for impairment by performing qualitative assessment or quantitative test if we choose to perform qualitative assessment we evaluate economic industry and company specific factor an initial step in assessing the fair value of operation if we determine it is more likely than of contentsnot that the carrying value of the net asset is more than the fair value of the related operation quantitative test is performed otherwise no further testing is required for operation where the quantitative test is used we compare the carrying value of net asset to the estimated fair value of the related operation if the fair value is determined to be le than carrying value the shortfall up to the carrying value of the goodwill represents the amount of goodwill impairment we generally estimate the fair value of the related operation using combination of discounted cash flow and market based valuation methodology such comparable public company trading value forecast of future cash flow are based on our best estimate of future sale operating cost and change in working capital these forecast reflect existing firm order expected future order expected production rate and delivery profile contract with supplier labor agreement and general market condition change in these forecast could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded if any the cash flow forecast are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus suitable control premium at the date of evaluation therefore change in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded if any we completed our annual assessment of goodwill of april and determined that there wa no impairment of goodwill result of the continuing significant adverse impact of the covid pandemic on our commercial airplane and commercial service business we concluded it is triggering event for testing whether goodwill recorded by our commercial airplane and commercial service reporting unit is impaired at december commercial airplane ha million of goodwill and commercial service ha million we performed quantitative test and determined the fair value of our commercial airplane and commercial service reporting unit substantially exceeded their carrying value of december of december we also estimated the fair value of our other reporting unit significantly exceeded their corresponding carrying value we will continue to monitor the impact of the covid pandemic in future quarter change in our forecast discount rate or decrease in the value of our common stock could cause book value to exceed their fair value which may result in goodwill impairment charge in future period pension plansmany of our employee have earned benefit under defined benefit pension plan nonunion and the majority of union employee that had participated in defined benefit pension plan transitioned to company funded defined contribution retirement saving plan in additional union employee transitioned to company funded defined contribution retirement saving plan effective january accounting rule require an annual measurement of our projected obligation and plan asset these measurement are based upon several assumption including the discount rate and the expected long term rate of asset return future change in assumption or difference between actual and expected outcome can significantly affect our future annual expense projected benefit obligation and shareholder equity of contentsthe projected benefit obligation is sensitive to discount rate the projected benefit obligation would decrease by million or increase by million if the discount rate increased or decreased by basis point basis point change in the discount rate would not have significant impact on pension cost however net periodic pension cost is sensitive to change in the expected long term rate of asset return decrease or increase of basis point in the expected long term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased net periodic pension cost by million deferred income tax valuation allowancethe company ha deferred income tax asset of million at december that can be used in future year to offset taxable income and reduce income tax payable the company ha deferred income tax liability of million at december that will partially offset deferred income tax asset and result in higher taxable income in future year and increase income tax payable tax law determines whether future reversal of temporary difference will result in taxable and deductible amount that offset each other in future year the particular year in which temporary difference result in taxable or deductible amount generally are determined by the timing of the recovery of the related asset or settlement of the related liability the deferred income tax asset and liability relate primarily to federal and state tax jurisdiction on quarterly basis we ass the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax asset against future source of taxable income and reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax asset by recording valuation allowance if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not defined likelihood of more than that all or portion of such asset will not be realized this assessment which is completed on taxing jurisdiction basis take into account both positive and negative evidence recent history of financial reporting loss is heavily weighted source of objectively verifiable negative evidence cumulative pre tax loss in the three year period ending with the current quarter is considered to be significant negative evidence regarding future profitability if cumulative pre tax loss adjusted for non recurring item result in positive normalized earnings that would be considered an objectively verifiable source of positive evidence of the ability of the company to generate positive earnings in the future when there is recent history of operating loss and negative normalized earnings and return to operating profitability ha not yet been demonstrated we can not rely on projection of future earnings for purpose of assessing recoverability of our deferred tax asset in such case we use systematic and logical method to estimate when deferred tax liability will reverse and generate taxable income and when deferred tax asset will reverse and generate tax deduction the selection of methodology and assessment of when temporary difference will result in taxable or deductible amount involves significant management judgment and is inherently complex and subjective we believe that the methodology we use are reasonable and can be replicated on consistent basis in future period described above recent history of financial reporting loss is heavily weighted source of objectively verifiable negative evidence of the company ability to generate future taxable income to recover deferred tax asset during and the company generated significant loss and in the fourth quarter of the company reached three year cumulative pre tax loss position we expect cumulative three year loss to grow in record earnings in are replaced by result we also normalized earnings and other comprehensive income for certain non recurring item and expect to reach three year cumulative loss position in record earnings in are replaced with result for purpose of assessing the recoverability of deferred tax asset the company determined that it could not include future projected earnings in the analysis due to recent history of loss deferred tax liability represent the assumed source of future taxable income and the majority are assumed to generate taxable amount during the next five year deferred tax asset include amount of contentsrelated to pension and other postretirement benefit that are assumed to generate significant deductible amount beyond five year the company valuation allowance of million at december primarily relates to pension and other postretirement benefit obligation deferred tax asset that are assumed to reverse beyond the period in which reversal of deferred tax liability are assumed to occur because the pension and other postretirement benefit obligation are recorded to both continuing operation and other comprehensive income oci the company recorded portion of the fourth quarter increase in the valuation allowance to income tax expense in continuing operation million and portion to oci million if the company continues to generate loss and negative normalized earnings in future period additional valuation allowance may have to be recorded with corresponding adverse impact on earnings and or oci when income generation return to more normal level we can expect to see the allowance reverse and increase reported earnings and or oci for additional information regarding income tax see note of the note to the financial statement item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskinterest rate riskwe have financial instrument that are subject to interest rate risk principally fixed and floating rate debt obligation and customer financing asset and liability the investor in our fixed rate debt obligation do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligation prior to maturity therefore exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed rate debt in the first quarter of we entered into billion two year delayed draw floating rate term loan credit agreement an increase or decrease of basis point in interest rate on this floating rate debt would increase or decrease our pre tax earnings by million over the next month historically we have not experienced material gain or loss on our customer financing asset and liability due to interest rate change foreign currency exchange rate riskwe are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipt from customer and payment to supplier in foreign currency we use foreign currency forward contract to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payment and receipt related to our ongoing business foreign currency forward contract are sensitive to change in foreign currency exchange rate at december increase or decrease in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contract would have increased or decreased our unrealized loss by million consistent with the use of these contract to neutralize the effect of

presentation liquidity matter the global outbreak of covid and the grounding of the max airplane are having significant adverse impact on our business and are expected to continue to negatively impact revenue earnings and operating cash flow in future quarter the covid pandemic ha caused an unprecedented shock to demand for air travel creating tremendous challenge for our customer our business and the entire aerospace manufacturing and service sector we currently expect it will take approximately three year for travel to return to level and few year beyond that for the industry to return to long term trend growth there is significant uncertainty with respect to when commercial air traffic level will recover and whether and at what point capacity will return to and or exceed pre covid level during net cash used by operating activity wa billion and we expect negative operating cash flow in future quarter until commercial delivery ramp up in the first quarter of we entered into and fully drew on billion two year delayed draw term loan credit agreement delayed draw term loan facility in the second quarter of we issued billion of fixed rate senior note that mature between and in the fourth quarter of we issued billion of fixed rate senior note that mature between and result our cash and short term investment balance wa billion and our debt balance wa billion at december the major credit rating agency downgraded our short term and long term credit rating during and there is risk for further downgrade at december our debt balance includes no commercial paper borrowing compared to billion at december in the current environment we may have limited future access to the commercial paper market in addition we have term note of billion maturing in at december trade payable included billion payable to supplier who have elected to participate in supply chain financing program while access to supply chain financing ha been reduced due to our current credit rating and debt level we do not believe that these or future change in the availability of supply chain financing will have significant impact on our liquidity at december we had billion of unused borrowing capacity on revolving credit agreement we anticipate that these credit line will primarily serve back up liquidity to support our general corporate borrowing need our borrowing capacity includes billion day revolving credit facility which is set to expire in october of contentsin addition to our debt issuance we have taken number of action to improve liquidity during the first quarter of our board of director terminated it prior authorization to repurchase share of the company outstanding common stock and suspended the declaration and or payment of dividend until further notice we have also reduced production rate in our commercial business to reflect the impact of covid on the industry we are executing on our plan to reduce our workforce through combination of voluntary and involuntary layoff and natural turnover during we recorded severance cost for approximately employee of which approximately have left the company of december and the remainder are expected to leave in in the fourth quarter of we began using our common stock in lieu of cash to fund company contribution to our plan in december we awarded most of our employee one time stock grant that will vest in three year in lieu of merit increase we expect these action to further enable the company to conserve cash we are also working with our customer and supply chain to accelerate receipt and conserve cash for example the united state department of defense dod ha taken step to work with it industry partner to increase liquidity in the form of increased progress payment rate and reduction in withholds among other initiative we are also deferring certain tax payment pursuant to the coronavirus aid relief and economic security care act we have reduced discretionary spending including reducing or deferring research and development and capital expenditure in july we announced our business transformation effort to ass our business across five key pillar infrastructure overhead and organization portfolio and investment supply chain health and operational excellence within the infrastructure pillar we are assessing our overall facility requirement in light of reduced demand in our commercial business and remote and virtual work opportunity for large number of our workforce we also anticipate reduction in office space need compared to our current capacity however we consolidate our footprint we may incur near term adverse impact to earnings the overhead and organization pillar is focused on our cost structure and how we are organized so we can right size our workforce and simplify and reduce management layer and bureaucracy the portfolio and investment pillar includes aligning our portfolio and investment to focus on our core business and the change in market condition the supply chain pillar is focused on supply chain health and stability reducing indirect procurement spend and streamlining our transportation logistics and warehousing approach the operational excellence pillar is focused on improving performance enhancing quality and reducing rework these activity are not intended to constrain our capacity but to enable the company to emerge stronger and be more resilient when the market recovers based on our current best estimate of market demand planned production rate timing of cash receipt and expenditure our ability to successfully implement further action to improve liquidity well our ability to access additional liquidity if needed we believe it is probable that we will be able to fund our operation for the foreseeable future use of estimatesthe preparation of financial statement in conformity with generally accepted accounting principle gaap requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset and liability and disclosure of contingent asset and liability at the date of the financial statement and the reported amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period we believe that the accounting estimate and assumption are appropriate given the increased uncertainty surrounding the severity and duration of the impact of the covid pandemic however actual result could differ from those estimate of contentsoperating cyclefor classification of certain current asset and liability we use the duration of the related contract or program our operating cycle which is generally longer than one year standard issued and implementedin the first quarter of we adopted asu financial instrument credit loss topic measurement of credit loss on financial instrument using modified retrospective method which resulted in the recognition of allowance for credit loss on our consolidated statement of financial position of january and cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings to align our credit loss methodology with the new standard the standard replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology under topic with methodology that reflects expected credit loss and requires the use of forward looking expected credit loss model for account receivables loan and certain other financial asset see note and for additional disclosure in the first quarter of we also adopted asu intangible goodwill and other topic simplifying the test for goodwill impairment the standard simplifies the quantitative impairment test from two step process to one step process the quantitative test is performed by comparing the carrying value of net asset to the estimated fair value of the related operation if the fair value is determined to be le than carrying value the shortfall up to the carrying value of the goodwill represents the amount of goodwill impairment the standard continues to permit company to test goodwill for impairment by performing qualitative assessment or using the quantitative test revenue and related cost recognitioncommercial aircraft contract the majority of our bca segment revenue is derived from commercial aircraft contract for each contract we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received we allocate the transaction price to each commercial aircraft performance obligation based on relative standalone selling price adjusted by an escalation formula specified in the customer agreement revenue is recognized for each commercial aircraft performance obligation at the point in time when the aircraft is completed and accepted by the customer we use program accounting to determine the amount reported cost of sale in certain situation where an aircraft is still in our possession and title and risk of loss ha passed to the customer known bill and hold arrangement revenue will be recognized when all specific requirement for transfer of control under bill and hold arrangement have been met payment for commercial aircraft sale are received in accordance with the customer agreement which generally includes deposit upon order and additional payment in accordance with payment schedule with the balance being due immediately prior to or at aircraft delivery advance and progress billing contract liability are normal and customary for commercial aircraft contract and not considered significant financing component they are intended to protect from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of it obligation under the contract long term contract substantially all contract at bd and certain contract at bgs are long term contract with the government and other customer that generally extend over several year product sale under long term contract primarily include fighter jet rotorcraft cybersecurity product surveillance suite advanced weapon missile defense military derivative aircraft satellite system and modification of commercial passenger aircraft to cargo freighter service sale under long term contract primarily include support and maintenance agreement associated with our commercial and defense product and space travel on commercial crew of contentsfor each long term contract we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received we allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation to deliver good or service or collection of good and or service based on the relative standalone selling price long term contract will typically represent single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying good and or service and the significant service of integration that we provide while the scope and price on certain long term contract may be modified over their life the transaction price is based on current right and obligation under the contract and doe not include potential modification until they are agreed upon with the customer when applicable cumulative adjustment or separate recognition for the additional scope and price may result long term contract can be negotiated with fixed price or price in which we are reimbursed for cost incurred plus an agreed upon profit the federal acquisition regulation provide guidance on the type of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing the price for contract with the government certain long term contract include in the transaction price variable consideration such incentive and award fee if specified target are achieved the amount included in the transaction price represents the expected value based on weighted probability or the most likely amount long term contract revenue is recognized over the contract term over time the work progress either product are produced or service are rendered we generally recognize revenue over time we perform on long term contract because of continuous transfer of control to the customer for government contract this continuous transfer of control to the customer is supported by clause in the contract that allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience pay for cost incurred plus reasonable profit and take control of any work in process similarly for non government contract the customer typically control the work in process evidenced either by contractual termination clause or by our right to payment of the transaction price associated with work performed to date on product or service that do not have an alternative use to the company the accounting for long term contract involves judgmental process of estimating total sale cost and profit for each performance obligation cost of sale is recognized incurred the amount reported revenue is determined by adding proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reported cost of sale recognizing revenue cost are incurred provides an objective measure of progress on the long term contract and thereby best depicts the extent of transfer of control to the customer change in estimated revenue cost of sale and the related effect on operating income are recognized using cumulative catch up adjustment which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the change on current and prior period based on long term contract percentage of completion when the current estimate of total sale and cost for long term contract indicate loss provision for the entire reach forward loss on the long term contract is recognized net cumulative catch up adjustment to prior year revenue and earnings including certain reach forward loss across all long term contract were follows decrease increase to revenue increase to loss decrease to earnings from operation decrease to diluted eps significant adjustment during the three year ended december included reach forward loss of and on kc tanker recorded during and well reach forward loss on commercial crew of during of contentsdue to the significance of judgment in the estimation process change in underlying assumption estimate supplier performance or circumstance may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future period payment under long term contract may be received before or after revenue is recognized the government customer typically withholds payment of small portion of the contract price until contract completion therefore long term contract typically generate unbilled receivables contract asset but may generate advance and progress billing contract liability long term contract unbilled receivables and advance and progress billing are not considered significant financing component because they are intended to protect either the customer or the company in the event that some or all of the obligation under the contract are not completed commercial spare part contract certain contract at our bgs segment include sale of commercial spare part for each contract we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received the spare part have discrete unit price that represent fair value we generally consider each spare part to be separate performance obligation revenue is recognized for each commercial spare part performance obligation at the point in time of delivery to the customer we may provide our customer with right to return commercial spare part where customer may receive full or partial refund credit applied to amount owed different product in exchange or any combination of these item we consider the potential for customer return in the estimated transaction price the amount reported cost of sale is recorded at average cost payment for commercial spare part sale are typically received shortly after delivery other service revenue contract certain contract at our bgs segment are for sale of service to commercial customer including maintenance training data analytics and information based service we recognize revenue for these service performance obligation over time the service are rendered the method of measuring progress such straight line or billable amount varies depending upon which method best depicts the transfer of control to the customer based on the type of service performed cost of sale is recorded incurred concession sharing arrangement we account for sale concession to our customer in consideration of their purchase of product and service reduction of the transaction price and the revenue that is recognized for the related performance obligation the sale concession incurred may be partially reimbursed by certain supplier in accordance with concession sharing arrangement we record these reimbursement which are presumed to represent reduction in the price of the vendor product or service reduction in cost of product unbilled receivables and advance and progress billing unbilled receivables contract asset arise when the company recognizes revenue for amount which can not yet be billed under term of the contract with the customer advance and progress billing contract liability arise when the company receives payment from customer in advance of recognizing revenue the amount of unbilled receivables or advance and progress billing is determined for each contract financial service revenue we record financial service revenue associated with sale type finance lease operating lease and note receivable lease and financing revenue arrangement are included in sale of service on the consolidated statement of operation for sale type finance lease we record financing receivables at lease inception financing receivable is recorded at the aggregate of future minimum lease payment estimated residual value of the leased equipment and deferred incremental direct cost le unearned income income is recognized over the life of the lease to approximate level rate of return on the net investment income recognition is generally suspended for financing receivables at the date full recovery of income and principal becomes not probable income is recognized when financing receivables become contractually current and performance is demonstrated by the customer residual of contentsvalues which are reviewed periodically represent the estimated amount we expect to receive at lease termination from the disposition of the leased equipment actual residual value realized could differ from these estimate decline in estimated residual value that are deemed other than temporary are recognized in the period in which the decline occur for operating lease revenue on leased aircraft and equipment is recorded on straight line basis over the term of the lease operating lease asset included in customer financing are recorded at cost and depreciated over the period that we project we will hold the asset to an estimated residual value using the straight line method we periodically review our estimate of residual value and recognize forecasted change by prospectively adjusting depreciation expense for note receivable note are recorded net of any unamortized discount and deferred incremental direct cost interest income and amortization of any discount are recorded ratably over the related term of the note reinsurance revenue our wholly owned insurance subsidiary astro ltd participates in reinsurance pool for worker compensation the member agreement and practice of the reinsurance pool minimize any participating member individual risk reinsurance revenue were and during and respectively reinsurance cost related to premium and claim paid to the reinsurance pool were and during and respectively revenue and cost are presented net in cost of sale in the consolidated statement of operation fleet supportwe provide assistance and support to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation to the operator of all our commercial airplane model collectively known fleet support these activity and support service include flight and maintenance training field service support engineering support and technical data and document fleet support activity begin prior to aircraft delivery the customer receives training manual and technical consulting support this activity continues throughout the aircraft operational life service provided after delivery include field service support consulting on maintenance repair and operational issue brought forth by the customer or regulator updating manual and engineering data and the issuance of service bulletin that impact the entire model fleet field service support involves our personnel located at customer facility providing and coordinating fleet support activity and request the cost for fleet support are expensed incurred cost of service research and developmentresearch and development includes cost incurred for experimentation design and testing well bid and proposal effort related to government product and service which are expensed incurred unless the cost are related to certain contractual arrangement with customer cost that are incurred pursuant to such contractual arrangement are recorded over the period that revenue is recognized consistent with our contract accounting policy we have certain research and development arrangement that meet the requirement for best effort research and development accounting accordingly the amount funded by the customer are recognized an offset to our research and development expense rather than contract revenue research and development expense included bid and proposal cost of and in and respectively share based compensationwe provide various form of share based compensation to our employee for award settled in share we measure compensation expense based on the grant date fair value net of estimated forfeiture for award settled in cash or that may be settled in cash we measure compensation of contentsexpense based on the fair value at each reporting date net of estimated forfeiture the expense is recognized over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period of the award income taxesprovisions for federal state and local and non income tax are calculated on reported loss earnings before income tax based on current tax law and also include in the current period the cumulative effect of any change in tax rate from those used previously in determining deferred tax asset and liability such provision differ from the amount currently receivable or payable because certain item of income and expense are recognized in different time period for financial reporting purpose than for income tax purpose significant judgment is required in determining income tax provision and evaluating tax position the accounting for uncertainty in income tax requires more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax position taken or expected to be taken in tax return we record liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured for financial statement purpose and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return to the extent that our assessment of such tax position change the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made tax related interest and penalty are classified component of income tax benefit expense we also ass the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax asset against future source of taxable income and reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax asset by recording valuation allowance if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not that all or portion of such asset will not be realized change in our estimate and judgment regarding realization of deferred tax asset may result in an increase or decrease to our tax expense and or other comprehensive income which would be recorded in the period in which the change occurs postretirement plansmany of our employee have earned benefit under defined benefit pension plan nonunion and the majority of union employee that had participated in defined benefit pension plan transitioned to company funded defined contribution retirement saving plan in additional union employee transitioned to company funded defined contribution retirement saving plan effective january we also provide postretirement benefit plan other than pension consisting principally of health care coverage to eligible retiree and qualifying dependent benefit under the pension and other postretirement benefit plan are generally based on age at retirement and year of service and for some pension plan benefit are also based on the employee annual earnings the net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plan is determined using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumption the most significant of which are the discount rate the long term rate of asset return and medical trend rate of growth for medical cost portion of the service cost component of net periodic pension and other postretirement income or expense is not recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to production product cost and reflected in inventory at the end of reporting period actuarial gain and loss which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumption are reflected in shareholder equity net of tax if actuarial gain and loss exceed ten percent of the greater of plan asset or plan liability we amortize them over the average expected future lifetime of participant the funded status of our pension and postretirement plan is reflected on the consolidated statement of financial position postemployment planswe record liability for postemployment benefit such severance or job training when payment is probable the amount is reasonably estimable and the obligation relates to right that have vested or accumulated of contentsenvironmental remediationwe are subject to federal and state requirement for protection of the environment including those for discharge of hazardous material and remediation of contaminated site we routinely ass based on in depth study expert analysis and legal review our contingency obligation and commitment for remediation of contaminated site including assessment of range and probability of recovery from other responsible party and or insurance carrier our policy is to accrue and charge to current expense identified exposure related to environmental remediation site when it is probable that liability ha been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated the amount of the liability is based on our best estimate or the low end of range of reasonably possible exposure for investigation cleanup and monitoring cost to be incurred estimated remediation cost are not discounted to present value the timing of payment can not be reasonably estimated we may be able to recover portion of the remediation cost from insurer or other third party such recovery are recorded when realization of the claim for recovery is deemed probable cash and cash equivalentscash and cash equivalent consist of highly liquid instrument such commercial paper time deposit and other money market instrument which have original maturity of three month or le we aggregate our cash balance by bank where condition for right of set off are met and reclassify any negative balance consisting mainly of uncleared check to account payable negative balance reclassified to account payable were and at december and inventoriesinventoried cost on commercial aircraft program and long term contract include direct engineering production and tooling and other non recurring cost and applicable overhead which includes fringe benefit production related indirect and plant management salary and plant service not in excess of estimated net realizable value to the extent material amount of such cost are related to an abnormal event or are fixed cost not appropriately attributable to our program or contract they are expensed in the current period rather than inventoried inventoried cost include amount relating to program and contract with long term production cycle portion of which is not expected to be realized within one year included in inventory for federal government contract is an allocation of allowable cost related to manufacturing process reengineering commercial aircraft program inventory includes deferred production cost and supplier advance deferred production cost represent actual cost incurred for production of early unit that exceed the estimated average cost of all unit in the program accounting quantity higher production cost are experienced at the beginning of new or derivative airplane program unit produced early in program require substantially more effort labor and other resource than unit produced later in program because of volume efficiency and the effect of learning we expect that these deferred cost will be fully recovered when all unit included in the accounting quantity are delivered the expected unit cost for later delivery is below the estimated average cost of all unit in the program supplier advance represent payment for part we have contracted to receive from supplier in the future part are received supplier advance are amortized to work in process the determination of net realizable value of long term contract cost is based upon quarterly review that estimate cost to be incurred to complete all contract requirement when actual contract cost and the estimate to complete exceed total estimated contract revenue loss provision is recorded the determination of net realizable value of commercial aircraft program cost is based upon quarterly program review that estimate revenue and cost to be incurred to complete the program accounting quantity when estimated cost to complete exceed estimated program revenue to go program loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered unit in the accounting quantity of contentsused aircraft purchased by the commercial airplane segment and general stock material are stated at cost not in excess of net realizable value see aircraft valuation within this note for discussion of our valuation of used aircraft spare part inventory is stated at lower of average unit cost or net realizable value we review our commercial spare part and general stock material quarterly to identify impaired inventory including excess or obsolete inventory based on historical sale trend expected production usage and the size and age of the aircraft fleet using the part impaired inventory are charged to cost of product in the period the impairment occurs included in inventory for commercial aircraft program are amount paid or credited in cash or other consideration to certain airline customer that are referred to early issue sale consideration early issue sale consideration is recognized reduction to revenue when the delivery of the aircraft under contract occurs if an airline customer doe not perform and take delivery of the contracted aircraft we believe that we would have the ability to recover amount paid however to the extent early issue sale consideration exceeds advance and is not considered to be otherwise recoverable it would be written off in the current period precontract costswe may from time to time incur cost in excess of the amount required for existing contract if we determine the cost are probable of recovery from future order then we capitalize the precontract cost we incur excluding start up cost which are expensed incurred capitalized precontract cost are included in inventory in the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position should future order not materialize or we determine the cost are no longer probable of recovery the capitalized cost would be written off property plant and equipmentproperty plant and equipment are recorded at cost including applicable construction period interest le accumulated depreciation and are depreciated principally over the following estimated useful life new building and land improvement from to year and new machinery and equipment from to year the principal method of depreciation are follows building and land improvement declining balance and machinery and equipment sum of the year digit capitalized internal use software is included in other asset and amortized using the straight line method over year capitalized software service is included in other asset and amortized using the straight line method over the term of the hosting arrangement which is typically no greater than year we periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable life assigned to long lived asset including asset that may be subject to management plan for disposition long lived asset held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or fair value le cost to sell long lived asset held for use are subject to an impairment assessment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable if the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flow of the asset the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset lease we determine if an arrangement is or contains lease at the inception date operating lease are included in other asset with the related liability included in accrued liability and other long term liability asset under finance lease which primarily represent computer equipment are included in property plant and equipment net with the related liability included in short term debt and current portion of long term debt and long term debt on the consolidated statement of financial position operating lease asset represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liability represent our obligation to make lease payment arising from the lease operating lease asset and liability are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present of contentsvalue of lease payment over the lease term we use our estimated incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payment variable component of the lease payment such fair market value adjustment utility and maintenance cost are expensed incurred and not included in determining the present value our lease term include option to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option lease expense is recognized on straight line basis over the lease term we have lease agreement with lease and non lease component which are accounted for single lease component asset retirement obligationswe record all known asset retirement obligation for which the liability fair value can be reasonably estimated including certain asbestos removal asset decommissioning and contractual lease restoration obligation recorded amount are not material we also have known conditional asset retirement obligation such certain asbestos remediation and asset decommissioning activity to be performed in the future that are not reasonably estimable due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation accordingly these obligation have not been recorded in the consolidated financial statement liability for these obligation will be recorded in the period when sufficient information regarding timing and method of settlement becomes available to make reasonable estimate of the liability fair value in addition there may be conditional asset retirement obligation that we have not yet discovered asbestos may exist in certain building but we have not become aware of it through the normal course of business and therefore these obligation also have not been included in the consolidated financial statement goodwill and other acquired intangiblesgoodwill and other acquired intangible asset with indefinite life are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstance change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist our annual testing date is april we test goodwill for impairment by performing qualitative assessment or using quantitative test if we choose to perform qualitative assessment and determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net asset is more than the fair value of the related operation the quantitative test is then performed otherwise no further testing is required for operation where the quantitative test is used we compare the carrying value of net asset to the estimated fair value of the related operation if the fair value is determined to be le than carrying value the shortfall up to the carrying value of the goodwill represents the amount of goodwill impairment indefinite lived intangible consist of brand and trade name and in process research and development ipr acquired in business combination ipr is initially capitalized at fair value an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter ipr is reclassified to finite lived acquired intangible asset when project is completed and then amortized on straight line basis over the asset estimated useful life we test these intangible for impairment by comparing the carrying value to current projection of related discounted cash flow any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flow represents the amount of the impairment our finite lived acquired intangible asset are amortized on straight line basis over their estimated useful life follows developed technology from to year product know how from to year customer base from to year distribution right from to year and other from to year we evaluate the potential impairment of finite lived acquired intangible asset whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable if the carrying of contentsvalue is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flow of the asset the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset investmentstime deposit are held to maturity investment that are carried at cost available for sale debt security include commercial paper government agency security and corporate debt security available for sale debt security are recorded at fair value and unrealized gain and loss are recorded net of tax component of accumulated other comprehensive income realized gain and loss on available for sale debt security are recognized based on the specific identification method available for sale debt security are assessed for impairment quarterly the equity method of accounting is used to account for investment for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over an investee significant influence is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of an investee of between and the cumulative earnings approach is used for cash flow classification of distribution received from equity method investment other equity investment are recorded at fair value with gain and loss recorded through net earnings equity investment without readily determinable fair value are measured at cost le impairment plus or minus observable price change equity investment without readily determinable fair value are assessed for impairment quarterly we classify investment income and loss on our consolidated statement of operation based on whether the investment is operating or non operating in nature operating investment align strategically and are integrated with our operation earnings from operating investment including our share of income or loss from equity method investment dividend income from other equity investment and any impairment or gain loss on the disposition of these investment are recorded in income from operating investment net non operating investment are those we hold for non strategic purpose earnings from non operating investment including interest and dividend on marketable security and any impairment or gain loss on the disposition of these investment are recorded in other income loss net derivativesall derivative instrument are recognized in the financial statement and measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent of holding them we use derivative instrument to principally manage variety of market risk for our cash flow hedge the derivative gain or loss is initially reported in comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period or period during which the hedged forecasted transaction affect earnings we have agreement to purchase and sell aluminum to address long term strategic sourcing objective and international business requirement these agreement are derivative for accounting purpose but are not designated for hedge accounting treatment we also hold certain derivative instrument for economic purpose that are not designated for hedge accounting treatment for these aluminum agreement and for other derivative instrument not designated for hedge accounting treatment the change in their fair value are recorded in earnings immediately allowance for loss on certain financial asset we establish allowance for credit loss on account receivable unbilled receivables customer financing receivables and certain other financial asset the adequacy of these allowance are assessed quarterly through consideration of factor including but not limited to customer credit rating bankruptcy filing published or estimated credit default rate age of the receivable expected loss rate of contentsand collateral exposure we assign internal credit rating for all customer and determine the creditworthiness of each customer based upon publicly available information and information obtained directly from our customer our rating category are comparable to those used by major credit rating agency aircraft valuationused aircraft under trade in commitment and aircraft under repurchase commitment in conjunction with signing definitive agreement for the sale of new aircraft sale aircraft we have entered into trade in commitment with certain customer that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at specified price upon the purchase of sale aircraft additionally we have entered into contingent repurchase commitment with certain customer wherein we agree to repurchase the sale aircraft at specified price generally to year after delivery of the sale aircraft our repurchase of the sale aircraft is contingent upon future mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft if we execute an agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft and if the customer exercise it right to sell the sale aircraft to contingent repurchase commitment would become trade in commitment our historical experience is that contingent repurchase commitment infrequently become trade in commitment exposure related to trade in commitment may take the form of adjustment to revenue for the difference between the contractual trade in price in the definitive agreement and our best estimate of the fair value of the trade in aircraft of the date of such agreement which would be recognized upon delivery of the sale aircraft and or charge to cost of product for adverse change in the fair value of trade in aircraft that occur subsequent to signing of definitive agreement for sale aircraft but prior to the purchase of the used trade in aircraft estimate based on current aircraft value would be included in accrued liability the fair value of trade in aircraft is determined using aircraft specific data such model age and condition market condition for specific aircraft and similar model and multiple valuation source this process us our assessment of the market for each trade in aircraft which in most instance begin year before the return of the aircraft there are several possible market in which we continually pursue opportunity to place used aircraft these market include but are not limited to the resale market which could potentially include the cost of long term storage the leasing market with the potential for refurbishment cost to meet the leasing customer requirement or the scrap market trade in aircraft valuation varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft on quarterly basis we update our valuation analysis based on the actual activity associated with placing each aircraft into market or using current published third party aircraft valuation based on the type and age of the aircraft adjusted for individual attribute and known condition used aircraft acquired by the commercial airplane segment are included in inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value it is our intent to sell these asset to mitigate cost and enhance marketability aircraft may be placed on operating lease while on operating lease the asset are included in customer financing customer financing customer financing includes operating lease equipment note receivable and sale type finance lease sale type finance lease are treated receivables and allowance for loss are established necessary we ass the fair value of the asset we own including equipment under operating lease asset held for sale or re lease and collateral underlying receivables to determine if their fair value are le of contentsthan the related asset carrying value difference between carrying value and fair value of sale type finance lease and note and other receivables determined by collateral value are considered in determining the allowance for loss on receivables we use median calculated from published collateral value from multiple third party aircraft value publication based on the type and age of the aircraft to determine the fair value of aircraft under certain circumstance we apply judgment based on the attribute of the specific aircraft or equipment usually when the feature or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attribute covered by outside publication impairment review for asset under operating lease and held for sale or re lease we evaluate for impairment asset under operating lease or asset held for sale or re lease when event or change in circumstance indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be le than the carrying value we use various assumption when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow including our intention for how long we will hold an asset subject to operating lease before it is sold the expected future lease rate lease term residual value of the asset period in which the asset may be held in preparation for follow on lease maintenance cost remarketing cost and the remaining economic life of the asset we record asset held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value le cost to sell when we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset allowance for loss on customer financing receivables we record the potential impairment of customer financing receivables in valuation account the balance of which is an accounting estimate of expected but unconfirmed loss the allowance for loss on receivables relates to two component of receivables receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment and all other receivables we determine receivable is impaired when based on current information and event it is expected that we will be unable to collect amount due according to the original contractual term of the receivable agreement without regard to any subsequent restructurings factor considered in assessing collectability include but are not limited to customer extended delinquency request for restructuring and filing for bankruptcy we determine specific impairment allowance based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated fair value of the related collateral we would expect to realize we review the adequacy of the allowance attributable to the remaining receivables after excluding receivables subject to specific impairment allowance by assessing both the collateral exposure and the applicable cumulative default rate collateral exposure for particular receivable is the excess of the carrying value of the receivable over the fair value of the related collateral receivable with an estimated fair value in excess of the carrying value is considered to have no collateral exposure the applicable cumulative default rate is determined using two component customer credit rating and weighted average remaining contract term internally assigned credit rating our credit quality indicator are determined for each customer in the portfolio those rating are updated based upon public information and information obtained directly from our customer we have entered into agreement with certain customer that would entitle to look beyond the specific collateral underlying the receivable for purpose of determining the collateral exposure described above should the proceeds from the sale of the underlying collateral asset resulting from default condition be insufficient to cover the carrying value of our receivable creating shortfall condition these agreement would for example permit to take the action necessary to sell or retain certain other asset in which the customer ha an equity interest and use the proceeds to cover the shortfall of contentseach quarter we review customer credit rating published historical credit default rate for different rating category and multiple third party aircraft value publication basis to validate the reasonableness of the allowance for loss on receivables there can be no assurance that actual result will not differ from estimate or that the consideration of these factor in the future will not result in an increase or decrease to the allowance for loss on receivables warrantiesin conjunction with certain product sale we provide warranty that cover factor such non conformance to specification and defect in material and design the majority of our warranty are issued by our commercial airplane segment generally aircraft sale are accompanied by to year standard warranty for system accessory equipment part and software manufactured by or manufactured to certain standard under our authorization these warranty are included in the program estimate at completion on occasion we have made commitment beyond the standard warranty obligation to correct fleet wide major issue of particular model resulting in additional accrued warranty expense warranty issued by our bd segment principally relate to sale of military aircraft and weapon system these sale are generally accompanied by six month to two year warranty period and cover system accessory equipment part and software manufactured by to certain contractual specification estimated cost related to standard warranty are recorded in the period in which the related product delivery occurs the warranty liability recorded at each balance sheet date reflects the estimated number of month of warranty coverage outstanding for product delivered time the average of historical monthly warranty payment well additional amount for certain major warranty issue that exceed normal claim level estimated cost of these additional warranty issue are considered change to the initial liability estimate we provide guarantee to certain commercial airplane customer which include compensation provision for failure to meet specified aircraft performance target we account for these performance guarantee warranty the estimated liability for these warranty is based on known and anticipated operational characteristic and forecasted customer operation of the aircraft relative to contractually specified performance target and anticipated settlement when contractual remedy are not specified estimated payment are recorded reduction of revenue at delivery of the related aircraft we have agreement that require certain supplier to compensate for amount paid to customer for failure of supplied equipment to meet specified performance target claim against supplier under these agreement are included in inventory and recorded reduction in cost of product at delivery of the related aircraft these performance warranty and claim against supplier are included in the program estimate at completion supplier penaltieswe record an accrual for supplier penalty when an event occurs that make it probable that supplier penalty will be incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable until an event occurs we fully anticipate accepting all product procured under production related contract guaranteeswe record liability in accrued liability for the fair value of guarantee for credit guarantee the liability is equal to the present value of the expected loss we determine the expected loss by multiplying the creditor default rate by the guarantee amount reduced by the expected recovery if applicable at inception of guarantee and adjusted each quarter we also recognize liability for the expected contingent loss of contentsnote goodwill and acquired intangibleseffective at the beginning

deferred tax liability are assumed to reverse and generate taxable income over the next to year while deferred tax asset related to pension and other postretirement benefit obligation are assumed to reverse and generate tax deduction over the next to year the valuation allowance primarily result from not having sufficient income from deferred tax liability reversal in the appropriate future

including an investigation by the security and exchange commission the outcome of which may be material other than described below with respect to the department of justice we can not of contentsreasonably estimate range of loss if any not covered by available insurance that may result given the current status of the lawsuit investigation and inquiry related to the max on january we

prosecution agreement requires that we make payment totaling billion which consist of million criminal monetary penalty million in additional compensation to the heir and or beneficiary of those who died in the lion air flight and ethiopian airline flight accident and billion to the company airline customer for harm incurred result of the grounding of the max offset in part by payment already made and the remainder satisfied through payment to be made prior to the termination of the deferred prosecution agreement the agreement also requires that we review our compliance program and undertake continuous improvement effort with respect to it and implement enhanced compliance reporting and internal control mechanism of the payment described above billion ha been included in amount reserved in prior quarter for max customer consideration we expensed million in the fourth quarter of related to this agreement during the fourth quarter of the faa rescinded the order that grounded max aircraft and issued an airworthiness directive specifying requirement that must be met before carrier can resume service including installing software enhancement completing wire separation modification conducting pilot training and performing maintenance step to prepare parked aircraft to fly the faa also issued continued airworthiness notification to the international community and published the max training requirement the faa must approve max pilot training program revision for each airline operating the aircraft and ha indicated it intent to retain it authority to issue airworthiness certificate and export certificate of airworthiness for all new max aircraft manufactured subsequent to the grounding order the brazilian national civil aviation agency approved return of operation in the fourth quarter of and transport canada and the european union aviation safety agency easa approved return of operation in the first quarter of in december we delivered aircraft in compliance with the faa regulatory requirement described above we have assumed that the remaining non regulatory approval will occur and enable delivery during the first half of we have approximately airplane in inventory of december number of customer have requested to defer delivery or to cancel order for max aircraft and we are remarketing and or delaying delivery of certain aircraft included within inventory we now expect to deliver about half of the max aircraft in inventory by the end of in the event that we are unable to resume aircraft delivery in non jurisdiction consistent with our assumption of regulatory approval timing our expectation of delivery timing could be impacted due to the grounding and associated suspension of max delivery we temporarily suspended max production beginning in january we resumed early stage of max production in may and continued to produce at low rate through the end of in addition we reduced the number of aircraft included in the accounting quantity by unit in the first quarter of result of reduction to planned production rate due to covid driven market uncertainty we are producing at abnormally low production rate in and we expect to incur approximately billion of abnormal production cost that are being expensed incurred the slowdown in the planned production rate ramp up increased expected abnormal cost however this increase wa offset by adjustment to the determination of the normal production level due to covid impact on customer demand well cost reduction activity including significant of contentsreductions in employment level we expensed of abnormal production cost during the year ended december in addition to impact related to the max accident and subsequent grounding the program continues to be significantly impacted by the covid pandemic and it effect on aircraft demand these impact have resulted in lower production and delivery rate assumption we currently expect to gradually increase the production rate to per month by early we currently assume that we will implement further gradual production rate increase in subsequent period based on market demand the ongoing impact of covid on market demand have also created significant uncertainty around the timing of delivery of max aircraft in inventory we may need to recognize additional cost associated with remarketing and or reconfiguring aircraft in inventory which may reduce revenue and or earnings in future period we have also recorded additional expense of and due to the max grounding during and which include cost related to storage inventory impairment pilot training and software update the following table summarizes change in the max customer concession and other consideration liability during balance january initial liability recorded in the second quarter of reduction for payment made reduction for concession and other in kind consideration change in ending balance december we are working with our customer to minimize the impact to their operation from grounded and undelivered aircraft we continue to reassess the liability for estimated potential concession and other consideration to customer on quarterly basis this reassessment includes updating estimate to reflect revision to return to service delivery and production rate assumption driven by timing of regulatory approval well latest information based on engagement with max customer the liability represents our current best estimate of future concession and other consideration to customer and is necessarily based on series of assumption it is subject to change in future quarter negotiation with customer mature and timing and condition of return to service are better understood the liability balance of billion at december includes billion expected to be liquidated by lower customer delivery payment billion expected to be paid in cash and billion in other concession of the cash payment to customer we expect to pay billion in and billion in the type of consideration to be provided for the remaining billion will depend on the outcome of negotiation with customer the max remains grounded in certain non jurisdiction the civil aviation authority in those jurisdiction will determine the timing and condition of return to service our assumption reflect our current best estimate but actual timing and condition of return to service and resumption of delivery could differ from this estimate the effect of which could be material we are unable at this time to reasonably estimate potential future additional financial impact or range of loss if any due to continued uncertainty related to the timing and condition of return to service uncertainty related to the impact of covid on our operation supply chain and customer future change to the production rate supply chain impact and or the result of negotiation with particular customer any such impact including any change in our estimate could have material adverse effect on our financial position result of operation and or cash flow for example we expect that in the event of contentsthat we are unable to resume aircraft delivery in non jurisdiction consistent with our assumption the continued absence of revenue earnings and cash flow associated with max delivery would continue to have material impact on our operating result in the event that future production rate increase occur at slower rate or take longer than we are currently assuming we expect that the growth in inventory and other cash flow impact associated with production would decrease however while any prolonged production suspension or delay in planned production rate increase could mitigate the impact on our liquidity it could significantly increase the overall expected cost to produce aircraft included in the accounting quantity which would reduce program margin and or increase abnormal production cost in the future commercial air traffic ha fallen dramatically due to the covid pandemic while this trend ha impacted passenger traffic most severely near term cargo traffic ha also fallen significantly due to the global economic downturn and the reduction in cargo capacity on passenger airplane airline have significantly reduced their capacity and many could implement further reduction in the near future many airline are also implementing significant reduction in staffing these capacity change are causing and are expected to continue to cause negative impact to our customer revenue earnings and cash flow and in some case may threaten the future viability of some of our customer potentially causing default within our customer financing portfolio and or requiring to remarket aircraft that have already been produced and or are currently in backlog if max aircraft remain grounded for an extended period of time in non jurisdiction we may experience additional reduction to backlog and or significant order cancellation additionally we may experience fewer new order and increased cancellation across all of our commercial airplane program result of the covid pandemic and associated impact on demand our customer may also lack sufficient liquidity to purchase new aircraft due to impact from the pandemic we are also observing significant increase in the number of request for payment deferral contract modification lease restructurings and similar action and these trend may lead to additional earnings charge impairment and other adverse financial impact in our business over time in addition to the extent that customer have valid right to cancel undelivered aircraft we may be required to refund pre delivery payment putting additional constraint on our liquidity there is risk that the industry implement longer term strategy involving reduced capacity shifting route pattern and mitigation strategy related to impact from covid and the risk of future public health crisis in addition airline may experience reduced demand due to reluctance by the flying public to travel result there is significant uncertainty with respect to when commercial air traffic level will begin to recover and whether and at what point capacity will return to and or exceed pre covid level the covid pandemic also ha increased and it aftermath is also expected to continue to increase uncertainty with respect to global trade volume putting significant negative pressure on cargo traffic any of these factor would have significant impact on the demand for both single aisle and wide body commercial aircraft well for the service we provide to commercial airline in addition lengthy period of reduced industry wide demand for commercial aircraft would put additional pressure on our supplier resulting in increased procurement cost and or additional supply chain disruption to the extent that the covid pandemic or it aftermath further impact demand for our product and service or impairs the viability of some of our customer and or supplier our financial condition result of operation and cash flow could be adversely affected and those impact could be material of contentsenvironmentalthe following table summarizes environmental remediation activity
