of these foreign country that could materially affect the cost or value of import or export shift in pattern of international trade that adversely affect import and export market material reduction in foreign direct investment in these country and public health crisis including the outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease such the coronavirus and it variant strain covid we are dependent on certain key supplier of locomotive and rail due to the capital intensive nature and sophistication of locomotive equipment part and maintenance potential new supplier face high barrier to entry therefore if one of the domestic supplier of high horsepower locomotive discontinues manufacturing locomotive supplying part or providing maintenance for any reason including bankruptcy or insolvency or the inability to manufacture locomotive that meet efficiency or regulatory emission standard we could experience significant cost increase and reduced availability of the locomotive that are necessary for our operation additionally we utilize limited number of steel producer that meet our specification rail is critical to our operation for rail replacement program maintenance and for adding additional network capacity new rail and storage yard and expansion of existing facility this industry similarly ha high barrier to entry and if one of these supplier discontinues operation for any reason including bankruptcy or insolvency we could experience both significant cost increase for rail purchase and difficulty obtaining sufficient rail for maintenance and other project change to trade agreement or policy that result in increased tariff on good imported into the united state could also result in significant cost increase for rail purchase and difficulty obtaining sufficient rail human capital risk strike or work stoppage could adversely affect our operation the class railroad are party to collective bargaining agreement with various labor union the majority of our employee belong to labor union and are subject to these agreement dispute over the term of these agreement or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contract with these union could result in among other thing strike work stoppage slowdown or lockout which could cause significant disruption of our operation and have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and

interpretation of such law technological change affecting investigation and remediation the participation and financial viability of other party responsible for any such liability and the corrective action or change to corrective action required to remediate any existing or future site we could incur significant cost result of any of the foregoing and we may be required to incur significant expense to investigate and remediate known unknown or future environmental contamination which could have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and liquidity macroeconomic and industry risk we face competition from other railroad and other transportation provider we face competition from other railroad motor carrier ship barge and pipeline our main railroad competitor is burlington northern santa fe llc it primary subsidiary bnsf railway company bnsf operates parallel route in many of our main traffic corridor in addition we operate in corridor served by other railroad and motor carrier motor carrier competition exists for all three of our commodity group excluding most coal shipment because of the proximity of our route to major inland and gulf coast waterway barge can be particularly competitive especially for grain and bulk commodity in certain area where we operate in addition to price competition we face competition with respect to transit time quality and reliability of service from motor carrier and other railroad motor carrier in particular can have an advantage over railroad with respect to transit time and timeliness of service however railroad are much more fuel efficient than truck which reduces the impact of transporting good on the environment and public infrastructure and we have been making effort to convert truck traffic to rail additionally we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system while truck barge and maritime operator are able to use public right of way maintained by public entity any of the following could also affect the competitiveness of our transportation service for some or all of our commodity which could have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and liquidity improvement or expenditure materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of these alternative mode of transportation such autonomous or more fuel efficient truck ii legislation that eliminates or significantly increase the size or weight limitation applied to motor carrier or iii legislation or regulatory change that impose operating restriction on railroad or that adversely affect the profitability of some or all railroad traffic many movement face product or geographic competition where our customer can use different product natural gas instead of coal sorghum instead of corn or commodity from different location grain from state or country that we do not serve crude oil from different region sourcing different commodity or different location allows shipper to substitute different carrier and such competition may reduce our volume or constrain price additionally any future consolidation of the rail industry could materially affect our competitive environment we may be affected by climate change and market or regulatory response to climate change climate change including the impact of global warming could have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and liquidity restriction cap tax or other control on emission of ghgs including diesel exhaust could significantly increase our operating cost restriction on emission could also affect our customer that use commodity that we carry to produce energy use significant amount of energy in producing or delivering the commodity we carry or manufacture or produce good that consume significant amount of energy or burn fossil fuel including chemical producer farmer and food producer and automaker and other manufacturer significant cost increase government regulation or change of consumer preference for good or service relating to alternative source of energy emission reduction and ghg emission could materially affect the market for the commodity we carry and demand for our service which in turn could have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and liquidity government incentive encouraging the use of alternative source of energy also could affect certain of our customer and the market for certain of the commodity we carry in an unpredictable manner that could alter our traffic pattern including for example increasing royalty charged to producer of prb coal by the department of interior and the impact of ethanol incentive on farming and ethanol producer we could face increased cost related to defending and resolving legal claim and other litigation related to climate change and the alleged impact of our operation on climate change violent weather caused by climate change including earthquake hurricane fire flood extreme temperature avalanche and significant precipitation could cause line outage and other interruption to our infrastructure any of these factor individually or in operation with one or more of the other factor or other unforeseen impact of climate change could reduce the amount of traffic we handle and have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and liquidity while we work to implement our climate action plan our effort to achieve emission reduction target could significantly increase our operational cost and capital expenditure table of content our business financial condition and result of operation have been adversely affected and in the future could be materially adversely affected by pandemic or other public health crisis our business financial condition and result of operation have been adversely affected by covid covid ha caused and is expected to continue to cause global slowdown of economic activity including the decrease in demand for broad variety of good disruption in global supply chain and significant volatility and disruption of financial market resulting further in adverse effect on workforce customer and regional and local economy other future pandemic or public health crisis may cause these or similar consequence because the severity magnitude and duration of the covid pandemic and it economic consequence are rapidly changing and difficult to predict the impact on our business and financial condition remains uncertain the ultimate impact of the covid pandemic on our result of operation and financial condition remains uncertain and depends on numerous evolving factor which we may not be able to effectively respond to and are not entirely within our control these factor also may be of importance for other pandemic or public health crisis including not limited to governmental business and individual action that have been and continue to be taken in response to global pandemic or other public health crisis including restriction on travel and transport workforce pressure social distancing and shelter in place order the effect of pandemic or other public health

economic condition and level of economic growth and the pace of recovery the pandemic subsides well response to potential reoccurrence further pandemic or other public health crisis and the volatile regional and global economic condition stemming from such an event could also precipitate and aggravate the other risk factor that we identify which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition result of operation including revenue and profitability and or stock price additionally pandemic or other public health crisis also may affect our operating and financial result in manner that is not presently known to or that we currently do not consider to present significant risk to our operation financial risk we are affected by fluctuating fuel price fuel cost constitute significant portion of our transportation expense diesel fuel price can be subject to dramatic fluctuation and significant price increase could have material adverse effect on our operating result although we currently are able to recover significant amount of our fuel expense from our customer through revenue from fuel surcharge we can not be certain that we will always be able to mitigate rising or elevated fuel cost through our fuel surcharge additionally future market condition or legislative or regulatory activity could adversely affect our ability to apply fuel surcharge or adequately recover increased fuel cost through fuel surcharge fuel price fluctuate our fuel surcharge program trail such fluctuation in fuel price by approximately two month and may be significant source of quarter over quarter and year over year volatility particularly in period of rapidly changing price international political and economic factor event and condition affect the volatility of fuel price and supply weather can also affect fuel supply and limit domestic refining capacity severe shortage of or disruption to domestic fuel supply could have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and liquidity alternatively lower fuel price could have positive impact on the economy by increasing consumer discretionary spending that potentially could increase demand for various consumer product we transport however lower fuel price could have negative impact on other commodity we transport such coal and domestic drilling related shipment which could have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and liquidity we rely on capital market due to the significant capital expenditure required to operate and maintain safe and efficient railroad we rely on the capital market to provide some of our capital requirement we utilize long term debt instrument bank financing and commercial paper and we pledge certain amount of our receivables collateral for credit significant instability or disruption of the capital market including the credit market or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factor could restrict or prohibit our access to and significantly increase the cost of commercial paper and other financing source including bank credit facility and the issuance of long term debt including corporate bond significant deterioration of our financial condition could result in reduction of our credit rating to below investment grade which could restrict or at certain credit level below investment grade may prohibit from utilizing our current receivables securitization facility receivables facility this may also limit our access to external source of capital and significantly increase the cost of short and long term debt financing general risk factor we are affected by general economic condition prolonged severe adverse domestic and global economic condition or disruption

increase reliability of our service product reduce variability in network operation and improve resource utilization further train length initiative allow to efficiently add incremental volume growth to our existing train network we will continue to make capital investment to improve operational performance and efficiency more efficient network requires fewer locomotive freight car and other resource financial expectation we expect volume to outpace industrial production in the result of our business development effort are bringing new customer to our railroad in the current environment we expect continued margin improvement driven by pricing in excess of inflation and ongoing efficiency initiative better leveraging our resource and improving our service product we expect to generate strong cash flow from operating activity allowing to continue our industry leading dividend payout ratio and strong share repurchase program economic uncertainty remain in covid impact linger and could have material impact on our financial and operating result regardless of external factor we will focus on efficiently managing operation seeking new business opportunity protecting our employee customer and community and providing excellent service to our customer market condition while current forecast for industrial production indicate continued economic growth we expect uncertainty with covid and the economy to continue in government and consumer react to the resurgence mutation of the virus and vaccine mandate could result in or contribute to customer disruption an elongated

recorded in other income material and supply material and supply are carried at the lower of average cost or net realizable value table of content property and depreciation property and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on straight line basis over their estimated service life which are measured in year except for rail in high density traffic corridor all rail line except for those subject to abandonment and yard and switching track where life are measured in million of gross ton per mile of track we use the group method of depreciation where all item with similar characteristic use and expected life are grouped together in asset class and are depreciated using composite depreciation rate the group method of depreciation treat each asset class pool of resource not singular item we determine the estimated service life of depreciable railroad asset by mean of depreciation study under the group method of depreciation no gain or loss is recognized when depreciable property

include private agreement private rate letter quote public circular tariff and interline foreign agreement the performance obligation in our contract is typically delivering specific commodity from place of origin to place of destination and our commitment begin with the tendering and acceptance of freight bill of lading and is satisfied upon delivery at destination we consider each freight shipment to be distinct performance obligation we recognize freight revenue over time freight move from origin to destination the allocation of revenue between reporting period is based on the relative transit time in each reporting period with expense recognized incurred outstanding performance obligation related to freight move in transit totaled million at december and million at december and are expected to be recognized in the following quarter we satisfy our remaining performance obligation and deliver freight to destination the transaction price is generally specified in contract and may be dependent on the commodity origin destination and route customer incentive which are primarily provided for shipping to from specific location or based on cumulative volume are

prioritizes the input to valuation technique used to measure fair value into three broad level the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in it entirety fall is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in it entirety these level include level quoted market price in active market for identical asset or liability level observable market based input or unobservable input that are corroborated by market data level unobservable input that are not corroborated by market data we have applied fair value measurement to our short term investment certain equity investment pension plan asset and short and long term debt stock based compensation we issue treasury share to cover stock option exercise stock unit vestings and espp share while new share are issued when retention share are granted we measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based award made to employee including stock option and espp award compensation expense is based on the fair value of the award measured at the grant date and is expensed ratably over the service period of the award generally the vesting period the fair value of retention award is the closing stock price on the date of grant the fair value of stock option is determined by using the black scholes option pricing model and the fair value of espp award is based on the company contribution match earnings per share basic earnings per share are calculated on the weighted average number of common share outstanding during each period diluted earnings per share include share issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock option and stock based award where the conversion of such instrument would be dilutive table of content income tax we account for income tax by recording tax payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax asset and liability for the expected future tax consequence of event that are reported in different period for financial reporting and income tax purpose the majority of our deferred tax asset relate to expense that already have been recorded for financial reporting purpose but not deducted for tax purpose the majority of our deferred tax liability relate to difference between the tax base and financial reporting amount of our land and depreciable property due to accelerated tax depreciation including bonus depreciation revaluation of asset in purchase accounting transaction and difference in capitalization method these expected future tax consequence are measured based on current tax law the effect of future tax legislation are not anticipated when appropriate we record valuation allowance against deferred tax asset to reflect that these tax asset may not be realized in determining whether valuation allowance is appropriate we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax asset will not be realized based on management judgment using available evidence for purpose of estimating whether future taxable income will be sufficient to realize deferred tax asset we recognize tax benefit that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authority the amount recognized is measured the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely to be realized upon settlement liability for unrecognized tax benefit is recorded for any tax benefit claimed in our tax return that do not meet these recognition and measurement standard lease we determine if an arrangement is or contains lease at inception operating lease asset and operating lease liability are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payment over the lease term at commencement date when an implicit rate is not available we use collateralized incremental borrowing rate for operating lease based on the information available at commencement date including lease term in determining the present value of future payment the

with an initial term of month or le are not recorded on our consolidated statement of financial position lease with initial term in excess of month are recorded operating or financing lease in our consolidated statement of financial position pension benefit in order to measure the expense associated with pension benefit we must make various assumption including discount rate used to value certain liability expected return on plan asset used to fund these expense compensation increase employee turnover rate and anticipated mortality rate the assumption used by are based on our historical experience well current fact and circumstance we use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability associated with these benefit personal injury the cost of injury to employee and others on our property is charged to expense based on estimate of the ultimate cost and number of incident each year we use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability including unasserted claim our personal injury liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payment legal fee and incidental cost are expensed incurred environmental when environmental issue have been identified with respect to property currently or formerly owned leased or otherwise used in the conduct of our business we perform with the assistance of our consultant environmental assessment on such property we expense the cost of the assessment incurred we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such cost can be reasonably estimated we do not discount our environmental liability when the timing of the anticipated cash payment is not fixed or readily determinable legal fee and incidental cost are expensed incurred use of estimate the preparation of our consolidated financial statement in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect certain reported asset and liability the disclosure of certain contingent asset and liability of the date of the consolidated financial statement well the reported amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period

homogeneous network type asset turn over on continuous basis each year we develop capital program for the replacement of asset and for the acquisition or construction of asset that enable to enhance our operation or provide new service offering to customer we currently have more than depreciable asset class and we may increase or decrease the number of asset class due to change in technology asset strategy or other factor we determine the estimated service life of depreciable railroad asset by mean of depreciation study we perform depreciation study at least every year for equipment and every year for track asset rail and other track material tie and ballast and other road property our depreciation study take into account the following factor statistical analysis of historical pattern of use and retirement of each of our asset class evaluation of any expected change in current operation and the outlook for continued use of the asset evaluation of technological advance and change to maintenance practice and expected salvage to be received upon retirement table of content for rail in high density traffic corridor we measure estimated service life in million of gross ton per mile of track it ha been our experience that the life of rail in high density traffic corridor are closely correlated to usage the amount of weight carried over the rail the service life also vary based on rail weight rail condition new or secondhand and rail type straight or curve our depreciation study for rail in high density traffic corridor consider each of these factor in determining the estimated service life for rail in high density traffic corridor we calculate depreciation rate annually by dividing the number of gross ton mile carried over the rail the weight of loaded and empty freight car locomotive and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail by the estimated service life of the rail measured in million of gross ton per mile for all other depreciable asset we compute depreciation based on the estimated service life of our asset determined from the analysis of our depreciation study change in the estimated service life of our asset and their related depreciation rate are implemented prospectively under the group method of depreciation the historical cost net of salvage of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized the historical cost of certain track asset is estimated by multiplying the current replacement cost of track asset by historical index factor derived from inflation index published by the bureau of labor statistic and ii the estimated useful life of the asset determined by our depreciation study the index were selected because they closely correlate with the major cost of the property comprising the applicable track asset class because of the number of estimate inherent in the depreciation and retirement process and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variable until group of property is completely retired we continually monitor the estimated service life of our asset and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rate are appropriate in addition we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by our depreciation study any deficiency or excess is amortized component of depreciation expense over the remaining service life of the applicable class of asset for retirement of depreciable railroad property that do not occur in the normal course of business gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meet each of the following three condition is unusual ii is material in amount and iii varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation study gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of
