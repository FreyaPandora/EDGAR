regulatory environment that pose significant risk many of which are beyond that registrant control management of each registrant regularly meet with the chief risk officer and the registrant risk management committee rmc which comprises officer of the registrant to identify and evaluate the most significant risk of the registrant business and the appropriate step to manage and mitigate those risk the chief risk officer and senior executive of the registrant discus those risk with the finance and risk committee and audit committee of the exelon board of director and the comed peco bge and phi board of director in addition the generation oversight committee of the exelon board of director evaluates risk related to the generation business the risk factor discussed below could adversely affect one or more of the registrant consolidated financial statement and the market price of their publicly traded security each of the registrant ha disclosed the known material risk that affect it business at this time however there may be further risk and uncertainty that are not presently known or that are not currently believed by registrant to be material that could adversely affect it performance or financial condition in the future exelon consolidated financial statement are affected to significant degree by generation position predominantly nuclear generator selling power into competitive energy market with concentration in select region of contentsand the role of the utility registrant operator of electric transmission and distribution system in six of the largest metropolitan area in the united state factor that affect the consolidated financial statement of the registrant fall primarily under the following category all of which are discussed in further detail below market and financial factor exelon and generation result of operation are affected by price fluctuation in the energy market power price are function of supply and demand which in turn are driven by factor such the price of fuel in particular the price of natural gas which affect the price that generation can obtain for the output of it power plant the presence of other generation resource in the market in which generation output is sold the demand for electricity in the market where the registrant conduct their business the impact of on going competition in the retail channel and emerging technology and business model regulatory and legislative factor the regulatory and legislative factor that affect the registrant include change to the law and regulation that govern competitive market and utility regulatory business model cost recovery tax policy zero emission credit program and environmental policy in particular exelon and generation financial performance could be affected by change in the design of competitive wholesale power market or generation ability to sell power in those market in addition potential regulation and legislation including regulation or legislation regarding climate change and renewable portfolio standard rps could have significant effect on the registrant also return for the utility registrant are influenced significantly by state regulation and regulatory proceeding operational factor the registrant operational performance is subject to those factor inherent in running the nation largest fleet of nuclear power reactor and large electric and gas distribution system the safe secure and effective operation of the nuclear facility and the ability to effectively manage the associated decommissioning obligation well the ability to maintain the availability reliability safety and security of it energy delivery system are fundamental to exelon ability to achieve value added growth for customer community and shareholder additionally the operating cost of the registrant and the opinion of their customer regulator and shareholder are affected by those company ability to maintain the reliability safety and efficiency of their energy delivery system discussion of each of these risk category and other risk factor is included below market and financial factorsgeneration is exposed to depressed price in the wholesale and retail power market which could negatively affect it consolidated financial statement exelon and generation generation is exposed to commodity price risk for the unhedged portion of it electricity generation supply portfolio generation earnings and cash flow are therefore exposed to variability of spot and forward market price in the market in which it operates of contentsprice of fuel the spot market price of electricity for each hour is generally determined by the marginal cost of supplying the next unit of electricity to the market during that hour thus the market price of power is affected by the market price of the marginal fuel used to generate the electricity unit demand and supply the market price for electricity is also affected by change in the demand for electricity and the available supply of electricity unfavorable economic condition milder than normal weather and the growth of energy efficiency and demand response program could each depress demand in addition in some market the supply of electricity could often exceed demand during some hour of the day resulting in loss of revenue for base load generating plant such exelon nuclear plant retail competition generation retail operation compete for customer in competitive environment which affect the margin that generation can earn and the volume that it is able to serve in period of sustained low natural gas and power price and low market volatility retail competitor can aggressively pursue market share because the barrier to entry can be low and wholesale generator including generation use their retail operation to hedge generation output increased or more aggressive competition could adversely affect overall gross margin and profitability in generation retail operation sustained low market price or depressed demand and over supply could adversely affect exelon and generation consolidated financial statement and such impact could be emphasized given generation concentration of base load electric generating capacity within primarily two geographic market region namely the midwest and the mid atlantic these impact could adversely affect exelon and generation ability to fund regulated utility growth for the benefit of customer reduce debt and provide attractive shareholder return in addition such condition may no longer support the continued operation of certain generating facility which could adversely affect exelon and generation result of operation through accelerated depreciation expense impairment charge related to inventory that can not be used at other nuclear unit and cancellation of in flight capital project accelerated amortization of plant specific nuclear fuel cost severance cost accelerated asset retirement obligation expense related to future decommissioning activity and additional funding of decommissioning cost which can be offset in whole or in part by reduced operating and maintenance expense see note early plant retirement of the combined note to consolidated financial statement for additional information in addition to price fluctuation generation is exposed to other risk in the power market that are beyond it control and could negatively affect it result of operation exelon and generation credit risk in the bilateral market generation is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe generation money or are obligated to purchase energy or fuel from generation will not perform under their obligation for operational or financial reason in the event the counterparties to these arrangement fail to perform generation could be forced to purchase or sell energy or fuel in the wholesale market at le favorable price and incur additional loss to the extent of amount if any already paid to the counterparties in the spot market generation is exposed to risk result of default sharing mechanism that exist within certain market primarily rtos and isos the purpose of which is to spread such risk across all market participant generation is also party to agreement with entity in the energy sector that have experienced rating downgrade or other financial difficulty in addition generation retail sale subject it to credit risk through competitive electricity and natural gas supply activity to serve commercial and industrial company governmental entity and residential customer retail credit risk result when customer default on their contractual obligation this risk represents the loss that could be incurred due to the nonpayment of customer account balance well the loss from the resale of energy previously committed to serve the customer market design the wholesale market vary from region to region with distinct rule practice and procedure change in these market rule problem with rule implementation or failure of any of these market could adversely affect generation business in addition significant decrease in market participation could affect market liquidity and have detrimental effect on market stability the registrant are potentially affected by emerging technology that could over time affect or transform the energy industry including technology related to energy generation distribution and consumption all registrant some of these technology include but are not limited to further development or application of technology related to shale gas production renewable energy technology energy efficiency distributed generation and energy of contentsstorage device such development could affect the price of energy level of customer owned generation customer expectation and current business model and make portion of our electric system power supply and transmission and or distribution facility obsolete prior to the end of their useful life such technology could also result in further decline in commodity price or demand for delivered energy each of these factor could materially affect the registrant consolidated financial statement through among other thing reduced operating revenue increased operating and maintenance expense and increased capital expenditure well potential asset impairment charge or accelerated depreciation and decommissioning expense over shortened remaining asset useful life market performance and other factor could decrease the value of ndt fund and employee benefit plan asset and could increase the related employee benefit plan obligation which could require significant additional funding all registrant disruption in the capital market and their actual or perceived effect on particular business and the greater economy could adversely affect the value of the investment held within generation ndts and exelon employee benefit plan trust the registrant have significant obligation in these area and exelon and generation hold substantial asset in these trust to meet those obligation the asset value are subject to market fluctuation and will yield uncertain return which could fall below the registrant projected return rate decline in the market value of the ndt fund investment could increase generation funding requirement to decommission it nuclear plant decline in the market value of the pension and opeb plan asset will increase the funding requirement associated with exelon pension and opeb plan obligation additionally exelon pension and opeb plan liability are sensitive to change in interest rate interest rate decrease the liability increase potentially increasing benefit cost and funding requirement change in demographic including increased number of retirement or change in life expectancy assumption or change to social security or medicare eligibility requirement could also increase the cost and funding requirement of the obligation related to the pension and opeb plan if future increase in pension and other postretirement cost result of reduced plan asset or other factor can not be recovered or can not be recovered in timely manner from the utility registrant customer the consolidated financial statement of the utility registrant could be negatively affected ultimately if the registrant are unable to manage the investment within the ndt fund and benefit plan asset and are unable to manage the related benefit plan liability and the related asset retirement obligation their consolidated financial statement could be negatively impacted unstable capital and credit market and increased volatility in commodity market could adversely affect the registrant business in several way including the availability and cost of short term fund for liquidity requirement the registrant ability to meet long term commitment generation ability to hedge effectively it generation portfolio and the competitiveness and liquidity of energy market each could negatively impact the registrant consolidated financial statement all registrant the registrant rely on the capital market particularly for publicly offered debt well the banking and commercial paper market to meet their financial commitment and short term liquidity need if internal fund are not available from the registrant respective operation disruption in the capital and credit market in the united state or abroad could adversely affect the registrant ability to access the capital market or draw on their respective bank revolving credit facility the registrant access to fund under their credit facility depends on the ability of the bank that are party to the facility to meet their funding commitment those bank may not be able to meet their funding commitment to the registrant if they experience shortage of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volume of borrowing request from the registrant and other borrower within short period of time the inability to access capital market or credit facility and longer term disruption in the capital and credit market result of uncertainty changing or increased regulation reduced alternative or failure of significant financial institution could result in the deferral of discretionary capital expenditure change to generation hedging strategy in order to reduce collateral posting requirement or reduction in dividend payment or other discretionary us of cash in addition the registrant have exposure to worldwide financial market including europe canada and asia disruption in these market could reduce or restrict the registrant ability to secure sufficient liquidity or secure liquidity at reasonable term of december approximately or billion or billion and or billion of the registrant available credit facility were with european canadian and asian bank respectively the credit facility include billion including bilateral credit facility and credit facility for project of contentsfinance in aggregate total commitment of which billion wa available of december of december there were no borrowing under generation bilateral credit facility see note debt and credit agreement of the combined note to consolidated financial statement for additional information on the credit facility the strength and depth of competition in energy market depend heavily on active participation by multiple trading party which could be adversely affected by disruption in the capital and credit market and legislative and regulatory initiative that could affect participant in commodity transaction reduced capital and liquidity and failure of significant institution that participate in the energy market could diminish the liquidity and competitiveness of energy market that are important to the respective business of the registrant perceived weakness in the competitive strength of the energy market could lead to pressure for greater regulation of those market or attempt to replace market structure with other mechanism for the sale of power including the requirement of long term contract which could have material adverse effect on exelon and generation consolidated financial statement if any of the registrant were to experience downgrade in it credit rating to below investment grade or otherwise fail to satisfy the credit standard in it agreement with it counterparties it would be required to provide significant amount of collateral under it agreement with counterparties and could experience higher borrowing cost all registrant generation business is subject to credit quality standard that could require market participant to post collateral for their obligation if generation were to be downgraded or lose it investment grade credit rating based on it senior unsecured debt rating or otherwise fail to satisfy the credit standard of trading counterparties it would be required under it hedging arrangement to provide collateral in the form of letter of credit or cash which could have material adverse effect upon it liquidity the amount of collateral required to be provided by generation at any point in time depends on variety of factor including the notional amount of the applicable hedge the nature of counterparty and related agreement and change in power or other commodity price in addition if generation were downgraded it could experience higher borrowing cost result of the downgrade generation could experience downgrade in it rating if any of the credit rating agency concludes that the level of business or financial risk and overall creditworthiness of the power generation industry in general or generation in particular ha deteriorated change in rating methodology by the credit rating agency could also have negative impact on the rating of generation generation ha project specific financing arrangement and must meet the requirement of various agreement relating to those financing failure to meet those arrangement could give rise to project specific financing default which if not cured or waived could result in the specific project being required to repay the associated debt or other borrowing earlier than otherwise anticipated and if such repayment were not made the lender or security holder would generally have broad remedy including right to foreclose against the project asset and related collateral or to force the exelon subsidiary in the project specific financing to enter into bankruptcy proceeding the impact of bankruptcy on such arrangement may be significant assumption in performing impairment assessment of the project asset the utility registrant operating agreement with pjm and peco bge and dpl natural gas procurement contract contain collateral provision that are affected by their credit rating and market price if certain wholesale market condition were to exist and the utility registrant were to lose their investment grade credit rating based on their senior unsecured debt rating they would be required to provide collateral in the form of letter of credit or cash which could have material adverse effect upon their remaining source of liquidity pjm collateral posting requirement will generally increase market price rise and decrease market price fall collateral posting requirement for peco bge and dpl with respect to their natural gas supply contract will generally increase forward market price fall and decrease forward market price rise given the relationship to forward market price contract collateral requirement can be volatile in addition if the utility registrant were downgraded they could experience higher borrowing cost result of the downgrade utility registrant could experience downgrade in it rating if any of the credit rating agency concludes that the level of business or financial risk and overall creditworthiness of the utility industry in general or utility registrant in particular ha deteriorated utility registrant could experience downgrade if it current regulatory environment becomes le predictable by materially lowering return for the utility registrant or adopting other measure to limit utility rate additionally the rating for utility registrant could be downgraded if it financial result are weakened from current level due to weaker operating performance or due to failure to properly manage it capital structure in addition change in rating methodology by the agency could also have negative impact on the rating of the utility registrant of contentsthe utility registrant conduct their respective business and operate under governance model and other arrangement and procedure intended to assure that the utility registrant are treated separate independent company distinct from exelon and other exelon subsidiary in order to isolate the utility registrant from exelon and other exelon subsidiary in the event of financial difficulty at exelon or another exelon subsidiary these measure commonly referred to ring fencing could help avoid or limit downgrade in the credit rating of the utility registrant in the event of reduction in the credit rating of exelon despite these ring fencing measure the credit rating of the utility registrant could remain linked to some degree to the credit rating of exelon consequently reduction in the credit rating of exelon could result in reduction of the credit rating of some or all of the utility registrant reduction in the credit rating of utility registrant could have material adverse effect on the utility registrant see item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation liquidity and capital resource credit matter market condition and security rating for additional information regarding the potential impact of credit downgrade on the registrant cash flow generation financial performance could be negatively affected by price volatility availability and other risk factor associated with the procurement of nuclear and fossil fuel exelon and generation generation depends on nuclear fuel and fossil fuel to operate most of it generating facility nuclear fuel is obtained predominantly through long term uranium supply contract contracted conversion service contracted enrichment service or combination thereof and contracted fuel fabrication service natural gas and oil are procured for generating plant through annual short term and spot market purchase the supply market for nuclear fuel natural gas and oil are subject to price fluctuation availability restriction and counterparty default that could negatively affect the consolidated financial statement for generation generation risk management policy can not fully eliminate the risk associated with it commodity trading activity exelon and generation generation asset based power position well it power marketing fuel procurement and other commodity trading activity expose generation to risk of commodity price movement generation buy and sell energy and other product and enters into financial contract to manage risk and hedge various position in generation power generation portfolio generation is exposed to volatility in financial result for unhedged position well the risk of ineffective hedge generation attempt to manage this exposure through enforcement of established risk limit and risk management procedure these risk limit and risk management procedure may not work planned and can not eliminate all risk associated with these activity even when it policy and procedure are followed and decision are made based on projection and estimate of future performance result of operation could be diminished if the judgment and assumption underlying those decision prove to be incorrect factor such future price and demand for power and other energy related commodity become more difficult to predict and the calculation become le reliable the further into the future estimate are made result generation can not predict the impact that it commodity trading activity and risk management decision could have on it business or consolidated financial statement financial performance and load requirement could be adversely affected if generation is unable to effectively manage it power portfolio exelon and generation significant portion of generation power portfolio is used to provide power under procurement contract with the utility registrant and other customer to the extent portion of the power portfolio are not needed for that purpose generation output is sold in the wholesale power market to the extent it power portfolio is not sufficient to meet the requirement of it customer under the related agreement generation must purchase power in the wholesale power market generation financial result could be negatively affected if it is unable to cost effectively meet the load requirement of it customer manage it power portfolio or effectively address the change in the wholesale power market of contentschallenges to tax position taken by the registrant well

utility registrant result from operation cash flow or financial position all registrant the impact of economic downturn on the utility registrant customer such unemployment for residential customer and le demand for product and service provided by commercial and industrial customer and the related regulatory limitation on residential service termination could result in an increase in the number of uncollectible customer balance which would negatively affect the utility registrant consolidated financial statement generation customer facing energy delivery activity face similar economic downturn risk such lower volume sold and increased expense for uncollectible customer balance which could negatively affect generation consolidated financial statement see item quantitative and

customer using mbr mechanism that compare the actual cost of gas to market index the difference between the actual cost and the market index is shared equally between shareholder and customer purchased power and natural gas price fluctuate based on their relevant supply and demand significantly higher rate related to purchased power and natural gas could result in decline in customer usage lower revenue and potentially additional uncollectible account expense for the utility registrant in addition any challenge by the regulator or the utility registrant to the recoverability of these

dependent on weather condition and could make period comparison le relevant generation operation are also affected by weather which affect demand for electricity well operating condition to the extent that weather is warmer in the summer or colder in the winter than assumed generation could require greater resource to meet it contractual commitment extreme weather condition or storm could affect the availability of generation and it transmission limiting generation ability to source or send power to where it is sold in addition drought like condition limiting water usage could impact generation ability to run certain generating asset at full capacity these condition which can not be accurately predicted could have an adverse effect by causing generation to seek additional capacity at time when wholesale market are tight or to seek to sell excess capacity at time when market are weak certain long lived asset and other asset recorded on the registrant statement of financial

distribution of power and natural gas to their customer similarly there is risk that financial market regulation could increase the registrant compliance cost and limit their ability to engage in certain transaction in the planning and management of operation the registrant must address the effect of regulation on their business and change in the regulatory framework including initiative by federal and state legislature rtos exchange ratemaking agency and taxing authority additionally the registrant need to be cognizant and understand rule change or registrant action that could result in

significantly is title vii which is known the dodd frank wall street transparency and accountability act dodd frank dodd frank requires new regulatory regime for over the counter swap swap including mandatory clearing for certain category of swap incentive to shift swap activity to exchange trading margin and capital requirement and other obligation designed to promote transparency the primary aim of dodd frank is to regulate the key intermediary in the swap market which entity are swap dealer sd major swap participant msps or certain other financial entity but the law also applies to lesser degree to end user of swap the cftc dodd frank regulation generally preserved the ability of end user in the energy industry to hedge their risk using swap without being subject to mandatory clearing and many of the other substantive regulation that apply to sd msps and other financial entity generation manages and expects to be able to continue to manage it commercial activity to ensure that it doe not have to register an sd or msp or other type of covered financial entity there are some rulemaking proceeding that have not yet been finalized in particular proposed rule on position limit that would apply to both exchange traded future contract and economically equivalent over the counter swap although the company would incur some cost associated with monitoring and compliance with such rule it doe not expect the rule to have material impact on it business operation the utility registrant could also be subject to some dodd frank requirement to the extent they were to enter into swap however at this time management of the utility registrant continue to expect that their company will not be materially affected by dodd frank generation affiliation with the utility registrant together with the presence of substantial percentage of generation physical asset base within the utility registrant service territory could increase generation cost of doing business to the extent future complaint or challenge regarding the utility registrant retail rate result in settlement or legislative or regulatory requirement funded in part by generation exelon and generation generation ha significant generating resource within the service area of the utility registrant and make significant sale to each of them those fact tend to cause generation to be directly affected by development in those market government official legislator and advocacy group are aware of generation affiliation with the utility registrant and it sale to each of them in period of rising utility rate particularly when driven by increased of contentscosts of energy production and supply those official and advocacy group could question or challenge cost and transaction incurred by the utility registrant with generation irrespective of any previous regulatory process or approval underlying those transaction these challenge could increase the time complexity and cost of the associated regulatory proceeding and the occurrence of such challenge could subject generation to level of scrutiny not faced by other unaffiliated competitor in those market in addition government official and legislator could seek way to force generation to contribute to effort to mitigate potential or actual rate increase through measure such generation based tax and contribution to rate relief package the registrant could incur substantial cost to fulfill their obligation related to environmental and other matter all registrant the business which the registrant operate are subject to extensive environmental regulation and legislation by local state and federal authority these law and regulation affect the manner in which the registrant conduct their operation and make capital expenditure

nuclear capacity factor capacity factor for generating unit particularly capacity factor for nuclear generating unit significantly affect generation result of operation nuclear plant operation involve substantial fixed operating cost but produce electricity at low variable cost due to nuclear fuel cost typically being lower than fossil fuel cost consequently to be successful generation must consistently operate it nuclear facility at high capacity factor lower capacity factor increase generation operating cost by requiring generation to produce additional energy from primarily it fossil facility or purchase additional energy in the spot or forward market in order to satisfy generation obligation to committed third party sale including the utility registrant these source generally have higher cost than generation incurs to produce energy from it nuclear station nuclear refueling outage in general refueling outage are planned to occur every to month the total number of refueling outage along with their duration could have significant impact on generation result of operation when refueling outage last longer than anticipated or generation experience unplanned outage capacity factor decrease and generation face lower margin due to higher energy replacement cost and or lower energy sale and higher operating and maintenance cost nuclear fuel quality the quality of nuclear fuel utilized by generation could affect the efficiency and cost of generation operation remediation action could result in increased cost due to accelerated fuel amortization increased outage cost and or increased cost due to decreased generation capability operational risk operation at any of generation nuclear generation plant could degrade to the point where generation ha to shutdown the plant or operate at le than full capacity if this were to happen identifying and correcting the cause could require significant time and expense generation could choose to close plant rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning the plant to full capacity in either event generation could lose revenue and incur increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitment for plant operated but not wholly owned by generation generation could also incur liability to the co owner for nuclear plant not operated and not wholly owned by generation from which generation receives portion of the plant output generation result of operation are dependent on the operational performance of the operator and could be adversely affected by significant event at those plant additionally poor operating performance at nuclear plant not owned by generation could result in increased regulation and reduced public support for nuclear fueled energy which could significantly affect generation consolidated financial statement in addition closure of generating plant owned by others or extended interruption of generating plant or failure of transmission line could affect transmission system that could adversely affect the sale and delivery of electricity in market served by generation nuclear major incident risk although the safety record of nuclear reactor generally ha been good accident and other unforeseen problem have occurred both in the united state and abroad the consequence of major incident could be severe and include loss of life and property damage any resulting liability from nuclear plant major incident within the united state owned or operated by generation or owned by others could exceed generation resource including insurance coverage uninsured loss and other expense to the extent not recovered from insurer or the nuclear industry could be borne by generation and could have material adverse effect in generation consolidated financial statement additionally an accident or other significant event at nuclear plant within the united state or abroad whether owned generation or others could result in increased regulation and reduced public support for nuclear fueled energy and significantly adversely affect generation consolidated financial statement nuclear insurance required by the price anderson act generation carry the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance million for each operating site claim exceeding that amount are covered through of contentsmandatory participation in financial protection pool in addition the congress could impose revenue raising measure on the nuclear industry to pay claim exceeding the billion limit for single incident generation is member of an industry mutual insurance company neil which provides property and business interruption insurance for generation nuclear operation in previous year neil ha made distribution to it member but generation can not predict the

decommissioning obligation and funding nrc regulation require that licensee of nuclear generating facility demonstrate reasonable assurance that fund will be available in certain minimum amount at the end of the life of the facility to decommission the facility generation is required to provide to the nrc biennial report by unit annually for unit that have been retired and unit that are within five year of retirement addressing generation ability to meet the nrc estimated funding level including scheduled contribution to and earnings on the ndt fund the nrc funding level are based upon the assumption that decommissioning will commence after the end of the current licensed life of each unit generation recognizes liability the present value of the estimated future cost to decommission it nuclear facility the estimated liability is based on assumption in the approach and timing of decommissioning the nuclear facility estimation of decommissioning cost and federal and state regulatory requirement no assurance can be given that the cost of such decommissioning will not substantially exceed such liability fact circumstance or our estimate may change including change in the approach and timing of decommissioning activity change in decommissioning cost change in federal or state regulatory requirement on the decommissioning of such facility other change in our estimate or generation ability to effectively execute on it planned decommissioning activity the performance of capital market could significantly affect the value of the trust fund currently generation is making contribution to certain trust fund of the former peco unit based on amount being collected by peco from it customer and remitted to generation while generation through peco ha recourse to collect additional amount from peco customer subject to certain limitation and threshold it ha no recourse to collect additional amount from utility customer for any of it other nuclear unit if there is shortfall of fund necessary for decommissioning if circumstance changed such that generation would be unable to continue to make contribution to the trust fund of the former peco unit based on amount collected from peco customer or if generation no longer had recourse to collect additional amount from peco customer if there wa shortfall of fund for decommissioning the adequacy of the trust fund related to the former peco unit could be negatively affected and exelon and generation consolidated financial statement could be significantly affected see note asset retirement obligation of the combined note to consolidated financial statement for additional information forecasting trust fund investment earnings and cost to decommission nuclear generating station requires significant judgment and actual result could differ significantly from current estimate ultimately if the investment held by generation ndts are not sufficient to fund the decommissioning of generation nuclear unit generation could be required to take step such providing financial guarantee through letter of credit or parent company guarantee or making additional contribution to the trust which could be significant to ensure that the trust are adequately funded and that current and future nrc minimum funding requirement are met result generation consolidated financial statement could be significantly adversely affected additionally if the pledged asset are not sufficient to fund the zion station decommissioning activity under the asset sale agreement asa generation could have to seek remedy available under the asa to reduce the risk of default by zionsolutions and it parent see note asset retirement obligation of the combined note to consolidated financial statement for additional information for nuclear unit that are subject to regulatory agreement with either the icc or the papuc decommissioning related activity are generally offset within exelon and generation consolidated statement of operation and comprehensive income the offset of decommissioning related activity within the consolidated statement of operation and comprehensive income result in an equal adjustment to the noncurrent payable to affiliate at generation comed and peco have recorded an equal noncurrent affiliate receivable from generation and corresponding regulatory liability if the expected value in the ndt fund for any nuclear unit subject to the regulatory agreement with the icc is expected to not exceed the total decommissioning obligation for that unit the accounting to offset decommissioning of contentsrelated activity in the consolidated statement of operation and comprehensive income for that unit would be discontinued the decommissioning related activity would be recognized in the consolidated statement of operation and comprehensive income and the adverse impact to exelon and generation consolidated financial statement could be material for the nuclear unit subject to the regulatory agreement with the papuc any change to the peco regulatory agreement could impact exelon and generation ability to offset decommissioning related activity within the consolidated statement of operation and comprehensive income and the impact to exelon and generation consolidated financial statement could be material if the accounting to offset decommissioning related activity is discontinued any remaining balance in noncurrent payable to affiliate at generation and comed or peco noncurrent affiliate receivable from generation and corresponding regulatory liability may need to be reversed and could have material impact in generation consolidated statement of operation and comprehensive income generation financial performance could be negatively affected by risk arising from it ownership and operation of hydroelectric facility exelon and generation ferc ha the exclusive authority to license most non federal hydropower project located on navigable waterway federal land or connected to the interstate electric grid the license for the muddy run pumped storage project expires on december the license for the conowingo hydroelectric project expired on september ferc issued

not predict whether it will receive all the regulatory approval for the renewed license of it hydroelectric facility if ferc doe not issue new operating license for generation hydroelectric facility or station can not be operated through the end of it operating license generation result of operation could be adversely affected by increased depreciation rate and accelerated future decommissioning cost since depreciation rate and decommissioning cost estimate currently include assumption that license renewal will be received generation could also lose revenue and incur increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitment in addition condition could be imposed part of the license renewal process that could adversely affect operation could require substantial increase in capital expenditure could result in increased operating cost or could render the project uneconomic and significantly affect generation consolidated financial statement similar effect could result from change in the federal power act or the applicable regulation due to event at hydroelectric facility owned by others well those owned by generation the registrant business are capital intensive and their asset could require significant expenditure to maintain and are subject to operational failure which could result in potential liability all registrant the registrant business are capital intensive and require significant investment by generation in electric generating facility and by the utility registrant in transmission and distribution infrastructure project these operational system and infrastructure have been in service for many year equipment even if maintained in accordance with good utility practice is subject to operational failure including event that are beyond the registrant control and could require significant expenditure to operate efficiently the registrant respective consolidated financial statement could be adversely affected if they were unable to

registrant operating cost and customer and regulator opinion of the utility registrant are affected by their ability to maintain the availability and reliability of their delivery and operational system exelon and the utility registrant failure of the equipment or facility including information system used in the utility registrant delivery system could interrupt the electric transmission and electric and natural gas delivery which could negatively impact related revenue and increase maintenance and capital expenditure equipment or facility failure can be due to number of factor including natural cause such weather or information system failure specifically if the implementation of advanced metering infrastructure smart grid or other technology in the utility registrant service territory fail to perform intended or are not successfully integrated with billing and other information system the utility registrant consolidated financial statement could be negatively impacted furthermore if of contentsany of the financial accounting or other data processing system fail or have other significant shortcoming the utility registrant financial result could be negatively impacted if an employee or third party cause the operational system to fail either result of inadvertent error or by deliberately tampering with or manipulating the operational system the utility registrant financial result could also be negatively impacted in addition dependence upon automated system could further increase the risk that operational system flaw or internal and or external tampering or manipulation of those system will result in loss that are difficult to detect the aforementioned failure or those of other utility including prolonged or repeated failure could affect customer satisfaction and the level of regulatory oversight and the utility registrant maintenance and capital expenditure regulated utility which are required to provide service to all customer within their service territory have generally been afforded liability protection against claim by customer relating to failure of service under illinois law however comed could be required to pay damage to it customer in some circumstance involving extended outage affecting large number of it customer and those damage could be material to comed consolidated financial statement the utility registrant respective ability to deliver electricity their operating cost and their capital expenditure could be negatively impacted by transmission congestion and failure of neighboring transmission system exelon and the utility registrant demand for electricity within the utility registrant service area could stress available transmission capacity requiring alternative routing or curtailment of electricity usage with consequent effect on operating cost revenue and result of operation also insufficient availability of electric supply to meet customer demand could jeopardize the utility registrant ability to comply with reliability standard and strain customer and regulatory agency relationship with all utility potential concern over transmission capacity or generation facility retirement could result in pjm or ferc requiring the utility registrant to upgrade or expand their respective transmission system through additional capital expenditure the electricity transmission facility of the utility registrant are interconnected with the transmission facility of neighboring utility and are part of the interstate power transmission grid that is operated by pjm rto although pjm system and operation are designed to ensure the reliable operation of the transmission grid and prevent the operation of one utility from an adverse impact on the operation of the other utility there can be no assurance that service interruption at other utility will not cause interruption in the utility registrant service area if the utility registrant were to suffer such service interruption it could have negative impact in their and exelon consolidated financial statement the registrant are subject to physical security and cybersecurity risk all registrant the registrant face physical security and cybersecurity risk the owner operator of generation transmission and distribution facility and participant in commodity trading threat source continue to seek to exploit potential vulnerability in the electric and natural gas utility industry associated with protection of sensitive and confidential information grid infrastructure and other energy infrastructure and such attack and disruption both physical and cyber are becoming increasingly sophisticated and dynamic continued implementation of advanced digital technology increase the potentially unfavorable impact of such attack security breach of the physical asset or information system of the registrant their competitor vendor business partner and interconnected entity in rtos and isos or regulator could impact the operation of the generation fleet and or reliability of the transmission and distribution system or result in the theft or inappropriate release of certain type of information including critical infrastructure information sensitive customer vendor and employee data trading or other confidential data the risk of these system related event and security breach occurring continues to intensify and while the registrant have been and will likely continue to be subjected to physical and cyber attack to date none ha directly experienced material breach or disruption to it network or information system or our service operation however such attack continue to increase in sophistication and frequency the registrant may be unable to prevent all such attack in the future if significant breach were to occur the reputation of exelon or another registrant and it customer supply activity could be adversely affected customer confidence in the registrant or others in the industry could be diminished or exelon and it subsidiary could be subject to legal claim loss of revenue increased cost operation shutdown etc any of which could contribute to the loss of customer and have negative impact on the business and or consolidated financial statement moreover the amount and scope of insurance maintained against loss resulting from any such event or security breach may not be sufficient to cover loss or otherwise adequately compensate for any disruption to business that could result the utility registrant deployment of smart meter throughout their service territory could increase the of contentsrisk of damage from an intentional disruption of the system by third party in addition new or updated security regulation or unforeseen threat source could require change in current measure taken by the registrant or their business operation and could adversely affect their consolidated financial statement failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could negatively impact the registrant consolidated financial statement all registrant certain event such an employee strike loss of contract resource due to major event and an aging workforce without appropriate replacement could lead to operating challenge and increased cost for the registrant the challenge include lack of resource loss of knowledge and lengthy time period associated with skill development in this case cost including cost for contractor to replace employee productivity cost and safety cost could arise the registrant are particularly affected due to the specialized knowledge required of the technical and support employee for their generation transmission and distribution operation if the registrant are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce their consolidated financial statement could be negatively impacted the registrant could make investment in new business initiative including initiative mandated by regulator and market that may not be successful and acquisition could not achieve the intended financial result all registrant generation could continue to pursue growth in it existing business and market and further diversification across the competitive energy value chain this could include investment opportunity in renewables development of natural gas generation nuclear advisory or operating service for third party distributed generation potential expansion of the existing wholesale gas business and entry into liquefied natural gas such initiative could involve significant risk and uncertainty including distraction of management from current operation inadequate return on capital and unidentified issue not discovered in the diligence performed prior to launching an initiative or entering market these market mature there could be new market entrant or expansion by established competitor that increase competition for customer and resource additionally it is possible that ferc state public utility commission or others could impose certain other restriction on such transaction all of these factor could result in higher cost or lower revenue than expected resulting in lower than planned return on investment the utility registrant face risk associated with their regulatory mandated smart grid and utility of the future initiative and other non regulatory mandated

september the doe issued notice of proposed rulemaking nopr that would entitle certain eligible resilient generating unit those located in organized market with day supply of fuel on site not already subject to state cost of service regulation and satisfying certain other requirement to recover fully allocated cost and earn fair return on equity on their investment on january ferc issued an order terminating the rulemaking docket that it initiated to address the proposed rule in the doe nopr concluding the proposed rule did not sufficiently demonstrate there is resiliency issue and that it proposed remedy that did not appear to be just reasonable and nondiscriminatory required under the federal power act at the same time ferc initiated new proceeding to consider resiliency challenge to the bulk power system and evaluate whether additional ferc action to address resiliency would be appropriate ferc directed each rto and iso to respond within day to specific question about how they ass and mitigate threat to resiliency thereafter interested party submitted reply comment on may and party submitted further reply exelon ha been and will continue to be an active participant in these

market include minimum offer price rule mopr that is intended to preclude buyer from exercising buyer market power if resource is subjected to mopr it offer is adjusted to effectively remove the revenue it receives through government provided financial support program resulting in higher offer that may not clear the capacity market currently the moprs in pjm and nyiso apply only to certain new gas fired resource on january epsa filed two request with ferc one seeking to amend prior complaint against pjm and another seeking expedited action on pending nyiso compliance filing in an existing proceeding similar complaint also against pjm wa filed at ferc on may these complaint generally allege that the relevant mopr should be expanded to also apply to existing resource including those receiving zec compensation under the new york ce and illinois program exelon filed protest at ferc in response to each filing arguing generally that zec payment provide compensation for an environmental attribute that is distinct from the energy and capacity sold in the ferc jurisdictional market and therefore are no different than other renewable support program like the ptc and rps program that have generally not been subject to mopr however if successful for generation facility in pjm and nyiso that are currently receiving zec compensation quad city ginna fitzpatrick and nine mile point an expanded mopr could require exclusion of zec compensation when bidding into future capacity auction such that these facility would have an increased risk of not clearing in future capacity auction and thus no longer receiving capacity revenue during the respective zec program any mitigation of these generating resource could have material effect on exelon and generation future cash flow and result of operation the same risk would also exist for the salem facility if salem is selected an eligible facility under the new jersey zec program separately pjm submitted two proposed alternative capacity market reform in april for ferc consideration pjm argued that either alternative will resolve any conflict between state policy support for certain resource and the need to ensure reasonable price for non supported resource the first alternative wa to implement twice run capacity clearing mechanism known the repricing proposal and if not acceptable to ferc second of contentsalternative that would expand the existing mopr to both new and existing generating resource subject to certain exemption known moprex in june ferc issued an order rejecting both of pjm proposed alternative finding both to be unjust and unreasonable in the same order ferc also addressed one of the mopr complaint involving pjm and concluded based on that complaint and pjm filing that pjm existing tariff allows resource receiving out of market support to affect capacity price in manner that will cause unjust and unreasonable and unduly discriminatory rate in pjm regardless of the intent motivating the support ferc suggested that modifying two element of pjm existing tariff could produce just and reasonable replacement and asked for initial comment on it proposal by august later extended to october first ferc found that an expansion of the current mopr mechanism to cover all existing generating resource regardless of resource type including those receiving either zec or rec compensation could protect the capacity market from unwanted price suppression second ferc preliminarily found that modified version of pjm existing fixed resource requirement frr option could enable state subsidized resource and corresponding amount of load to be removed from the capacity market thereby alleviating their price suppressive effect on capacity clearing price under this alternative state supported generating resource would potentially be compensated through mechanism other than through pjm existing market mechanism ferc established march the refund effective date and also allowed pjm to delay it next capacity auction from may to august to allow party time to develop and file proposal in the ferc proceeding ferc time to determine the appropriate solution and pjm time to implement ferc solution on october exelon along with several ratepayer advocate environmental organization and other nuclear generator submitted shared principle supporting workable new frr mechanism suggested by ferc and detailing how such mechanism should be implemented exelon also submitted individual comment covering matter not addressed in the shared principle ferc ha not yet issued

response to the petition the secretary ha day to prepare and submit report to president trump who then ha day to act on the secretary recommendation exelon and generation can not currently predict the outcome of this investigation the relief sought by the petitioner would require nuclear reactor to purchase at least of their uranium need from domestic mine over the next year although the doc will make an independent determination regarding an appropriate remedy should it find that import impair national security it is reasonably possible that if this petition is successful the resulting increase in nuclear fuel cost in future period could have material unfavorable impact on exelon and generation financial statement potential doe order pursuant to defense production act and federal

physically delivered to the customer transaction of the registrant within the scope of revenue from contract with customer generally include non derivative agreement contract that are designated normal purchase and normal sale npns sale to utility customer under regulated service tariff and spot market energy commodity sale including settlement with independent system operator the determination of generation and the utility registrant retail power and natural gas sale to individual customer is based on systematic reading of customer meter generally on monthly basis at the end of each month amount of energy delivered to customer since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenue is recorded the measurement of unbilled revenue is affected by the following factor daily customer usage measured by generation or gas throughput volume customer usage by class loss of energy during delivery to customer and applicable customer rate increase or decrease in volume delivered to the utility customer and favorable or unfavorable rate mix due to change in usage pattern in customer class in the period could be significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue in addition revenue may fluctuate monthly result of customer electing to use an alternate supplier since unbilled commodity revenue are not recorded for these customer change in the timing of meter reading schedule and the number and type of customer scheduled for each meter reading date also impact the measurement of unbilled revenue however total operating revenue would remain materially unchanged see note significant accounting policy of the combined note to consolidated financial statement for additional information derivative revenue the registrant record

reasonable assurance that sufficient fund will be available in certain minimum amount to decommission the facility these nrc minimum funding level are based upon the assumption that decommissioning activity will commence after the end of the current licensed life of each unit if unit fails the nrc minimum funding test then the plant owner or parent company would be required to take step such providing financial guarantee through letter of credit or parent company guarantee or making additional cash contribution to the ndt fund to ensure sufficient fund are available see note asset retirement obligation of the combined note to consolidated financial statement for additional information on the nrc minimum funding requirement if nuclear plant were to early retire there is risk that it will no longer meet the nrc minimum funding requirement due to the earlier commencement of decommissioning activity and shorter time period over which the ndt fund could appreciate in value shortfall could require that generation address the shortfall by among other thing obtaining parental guarantee for generation share of the funding assurance however the amount of any guarantee or other assurance will ultimately depend on the decommissioning approach the associated level of cost and the ndt fund investment performance going forward within two year after shutting down plant generation must submit post shutdown decommissioning activity report psdar to the nrc that includes the planned option for decommissioning the site discussed in note asset retirement obligation of the

generation estimate parental guarantee of up to million from exelon could be required for salem dependent upon the ultimate decommissioning approach selected upon issuance of any required financial guarantee each site would be able to utilize the respective ndt fund for radiological decommissioning cost which represent the majority of the total expected decommissioning cost however the nrc must approve an additional exemption in order for the plant owner to utilize the ndt fund to pay for non radiological decommissioning cost spent fuel management and site restoration cost if unit doe not receive this exemption the cost would be borne by the owner while the ultimate amount may vary of contentsgreatly and could be reduced by alternate decommissioning scenario and or reimbursement of

on the registrant financial statement lease issued february increase transparency and comparability among organization by recognizing lease asset and lease liability on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangement the registrant adopted the standard on january the new standard requires lessee to recognize both the right of use asset and lease liability in the

whereas previous disclosure related only to lessee the recognition measurement and presentation of expense and cash flow arising from lease by lessee have not significantly changed from previous gaap lessor accounting is also largely unchanged the new standard provides number of transition practical expedient which the registrant have elected including package of three expedient that must be taken together and allow entity to not reassess whether existing contract contain lease carryforward the existing lease classification and not reassess initial direct cost associated with existing lease an implementation expedient which allows the requirement of the standard in the period of adoption with no restatement of prior period and land easement expedient which allows entity to not evaluate land easement under the new standard at adoption if they were not previously accounted for lease the registrant have assessed the lease standard and executed detailed implementation plan in preparation for

volatility contractual volume delivery location interest rate credit quality of counterparties and credit enhancement for commodity derivative the primary input to the valuation model is the forward commodity price curve for each instrument forward commodity price curve are derived by risk management for liquid location and by the trader and portfolio manager for illiquid location all location are reviewed and verified by risk management considering published exchange transaction price executed bilateral transaction broker quote and other observable or public data source the relevant forward commodity curve used to value each of the derivative depends on number of factor including commodity type delivery location and delivery period price volatility varies by commodity and location when appropriate generation discount future cash flow using risk free interest rate with adjustment to reflect the credit quality of each counterparty for asset and generation own credit quality for liability the level of observability of forward commodity price varies generally due to the delivery location and delivery period certain delivery location including pjm west hub for power and henry hub for natural gas are more liquid and price are observable for up to three year in the future the observability period of volatility is generally shorter than the underlying power curve used in option valuation the forward curve for le liquid location is estimated by using the forward curve from the liquid location and applying spread to represent the cost to transport the commodity

commodity derivative are forward commodity price and for option is price volatility increase decrease in the forward commodity price in isolation would result in significantly higher lower fair value for long position contract that give generation the obligation or option to purchase commodity with offsetting impact to short position contract that give generation the obligation or right to sell commodity increase decrease in volatility would increase decrease the value for the holder of the option writer of the option generally change in the estimate of forward commodity price is unrelated to change in the estimate of volatility of price an increase to the reserve listed above would decrease the fair value of the position an increase to the heat rate or renewable factor would increase the fair value accordingly generally interrelationship exist between market price of natural gas and power such an increase in natural gas pricing would potentially have similar impact on forward

activity are generally offset within exelon and generation consolidated statement of operation and comprehensive income regardless of whether the ndt fund are expected to exceed or fall short of the total estimated decommissioning obligation the offset of decommissioning related activity within the consolidated statement of operation and comprehensive income result in an equal adjustment to the noncurrent payable to affiliate at generation comed and peco have recorded an equal noncurrent affiliate receivable from generation and corresponding regulatory liability should the expected value of the ndt fund for any former comed unit fall below the amount of the expected decommissioning obligation for that unit the accounting to offset decommissioning related activity in the consolidated

to consolidated financial statement continued dollar in million except per share data unless otherwise noted nrc minimum funding requirementsnrc regulation require that licensee of nuclear generating facility demonstrate reasonable assurance that fund will be available in specified minimum amount to decommission the facility at the end of it life the estimated decommissioning obligation calculated using the nrc methodology differ from the aro recorded in generation and exelon consolidated balance sheet primarily due to difference in the type of cost included in the estimate the basis for estimating such cost and assumption regarding the decommissioning alternative to be used potential license renewal decommissioning cost escalation and the growth rate in the ndt fund under nrc regulation if the minimum funding requirement calculated under the nrc methodology are le than the future value of the ndt fund also calculated under the nrc methodology then the nrc requires either further funding or other financial guarantee key assumption used in the minimum funding calculation using the nrc methodology at december include consideration of cost only for the removal of radiological contamination at each unit the option on unit by unit basis to use generic non site specific cost estimate consideration of only one decommissioning scenario for each unit the plant cease operation at the end of their current license life with no assumed license renewal for those unit that have not already received renewal and with an assumed end of operation date of for tmi the assumption of current nominal dollar cost estimate that are neither escalated through the anticipated period of decommissioning nor discounted using the carfr and assumed annual after tax return on the ndt fund of for the former peco unit specified by the papuc in contrast the key criterion and assumption used by generation to determine the aro and to forecast the target growth in the ndt fund at december include the use of site specific cost estimate that are updated at least once every five year the inclusion in the aro estimate of all legally unavoidable cost required to decommission the unit radiological decommissioning and full site restoration for certain unit on site spent fuel maintenance and storage subsequent to ceasing operation and until doe acceptance and disposal of certain low level radioactive waste the consideration of multiple scenario where decommissioning and site restoration activity applicable are completed under possible scenario ranging from to year after the cessation of plant operation the consideration of multiple end of life scenario the measurement of the obligation at the present value of the future estimated cost and an annual average accretion of the aro of approximately through period of approximately year after the end of the extended life of the unit and an estimated targeted annual pre tax return on the ndt fund of to compared to historical year annual average pre tax return of approximately generation is required to provide to the nrc biennial report by unit annually for unit that have been retired or are within five year of the current approved license life based on value of december addressing generation ability to meet the nrc minimum funding level depending on the value of the trust fund generation may be required to

after which time the fee wa set to zero result for the year ended december and generation did not incur any expense in snf disposal fee until new fee structure is in effect exelon and generation will not accrue any further cost related to snf disposal fee this fee may be adjusted prospectively to ensure full cost recovery the nwpa and the standard contract required the doe to begin taking possession of snf generated by nuclear generating unit by no later than january the doe however failed to meet that deadline and it performance ha been and is expected to be delayed significantly the federal budget which became effective october eliminated almost all funding for the creation of the yucca mountain repository while the obama administration devised new strategy for long term snf management the blue ribbon commission brc on america nuclear future appointed by the energy secretary released report on january detailing comprehensive recommendation for creating safe long term solution for managing and disposing of the nation snf and high level radioactive waste in early the doe issued an updated strategy for the management and disposal of used nuclear fuel and high level radioactive waste in response to the brc recommendation this strategy included consolidated interim storage facility that wa planned to be operational in however due to continued delay on the part of the doe generation currently assumes the doe will begin accepting snf in and us that date for purpose of estimating the nuclear decommissioning asset retirement obligation the snf acceptance date

arising in connection with the west lake landfill in connection with exelon corporate restructuring this responsibility to indemnify cotter wa transferred to generation on may the epa issued record of decision rod approving landfill cover remediation approach by letter dated january the epa requested that the prps perform supplemental feasibility study for remediation alternative that would involve complete excavation of the radiological contamination on september the prps submitted the supplemental feasibility study to the epa for review since june the epa ha requested that the prps perform series of additional analysis and groundwater and soil sampling part of the supplemental feasibility study this further analysis wa focused on partial excavation remedial option the prps provided the draft final remedial investigation and feasibility study ri to the epa in january which formed the basis for epa proposed remedy selection further discussed below there are currently three prps participating in the west lake landfill remediation proceeding investigation by generation ha identified number of other party who also may be prps and could be liable to contribute to the final remedy further investigation is ongoing on september the epa issued it rod amendment for the selection of the final remedy for the west lake landfill superfund site the rod modifies the epa previously proposed plan for partial excavation of the radiological material by reducing the depth of the excavation the rod also allows for variation in depth of excavation depending on radiological concentration the epa estimate that the rod will result in reduction of both radiological and non radiological waste excavated with corresponding reduction in the cost and schedule for the remedy the next step is the negotiation of consent agreement by the epa with the prps to implement the rod process that is expected to be completed in the first quarter of the estimated cost of the remedy taking into account the current epa technical requirement and the total cost expected to be incurred by the prps in fully executing the remedy is approximately million including cost escalation on an undiscounted basis which would be allocated among the final group of prps generation ha determined that loss associated with the epa partial excavation and enhanced landfill cover remedy is probable and ha recorded liability included in the table above that reflects management best estimate of cotter allocable share of the ultimate cost for the entire remediation effort given the joint and several nature of this liability the magnitude of generation ultimate liability will depend on the actual cost incurred to implement the required remediation remedy well on the nature and term of any cost sharing arrangement with the final group of prps therefore it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost and generation associated allocable share could differ significantly once these uncertainty are resolved which could have material impact on exelon and generation future financial statement on january the prps were advised by the epa that it will begin an additional investigation and evaluation of groundwater condition at the west lake landfill in september the prps agreed to an administrative settlement agreement and order on consent for the performance by the prps of the

the extent to which if any remediation activity will be required and can not estimate reasonably possible range of loss for response cost beyond those associated with the ri component it is reasonably possible however that resolution of this matter could have material unfavorable impact on exelon and generation future financial statement during december the epa took two action related to the west lake landfill designed to abate what it termed imminent and dangerous condition at the landfill the first involved installation by the prps of non combustible surface cover to protect against surface fire in area where radiological material are believed to have been disposed which wa completed in the second action involved epa public statement that it will require the prps to construct barrier wall in an adjacent landfill to prevent subsurface fire from spreading to those area of the west lake landfill where radiological material are believed to have been disposed at this time generation belief that the requirement to build barrier wall is remote in light of other technology that have been employed by the adjacent landfill owner finally one of the other prps the landfill owner and operator of the adjacent landfill ha indicated that it will be making contribution claim against cotter for cost that it ha incurred to prevent the subsurface fire from spreading to those area of the west lake landfill where radiological material are believed to have been disposed at this time exelon and generation do not posse sufficient information to ass this claim and therefore are unable to estimate range of loss if any such no liability ha been recorded for the potential contribution claim it is reasonably possible however that resolution of this matter could have material unfavorable impact on exelon and generation financial statement on august cotter wa notified by the doj that cotter is considered prp with respect to the government clean up cost for contamination attributable to low level radioactive residue at former storage and reprocessing facility named latty avenue near st louis missouri the latty avenue site is included in comed indemnification responsibility discussed above part of the sale of cotter the radioactive residue had been generated initially in connection with the processing of uranium ore part of the government manhattan project cotter purchased the

criterion for decontamination of land area latty avenue wa investigated and remediated by the united state army corp of engineer pursuant to funding under fusrap the doj ha not yet formally advised the prps of the amount that it is seeking but it is believed to be approximately million from all prps the doj and the prps agreed to toll the statute of limitation until august so that settlement discussion could proceed generation ha determined that loss associated with this matter is probable under it indemnification agreement with cotter and ha recorded an estimated liability which is included in the table above commencing in february number of lawsuit have been filed in the district court for the eastern district of missouri among the defendant were exelon generation and comed all of which were subsequently dismissed from the case well cotter which remains defendant the suit allege that individual living in the north st louis area developed some form of cancer or other serious illness due to cotter negligent or reckless conduct in processing transporting storing handling and or disposing of radioactive material plaintiff are asserting public liability claim under the price anderson act their state law claim for negligence strict liability emotional distress and medical monitoring have been dismissed in the event of finding of liability against cotter it is probable that generation would be financially responsible due to it indemnification responsibility of cotter described above the court ha dismissed number of the lawsuit untimely which ha been upheld on appeal cotter and the remaining plaintiff have engaged in settlement discussion pursuant to court ordered mediation during the second quarter of generation determined loss wa probable based on the

this time and no liability ha been accrued for those future cost draft feasibility study of potential remedy and their estimated cost is being prepared by the agency and is expected to be released in at which time pepco will likely be in better position to estimate the range of loss in addition to the activity associated with the remedial process outlined above there is complementary statutory program that requires an assessment to determine if any natural resource have been damaged result of the contamination that is being remediated and if so that plan be developed by the federal state and local trustee responsible for those resource to restore them to their condition before injury from the environmental contaminant if natural resource are not restored then compensation for the injury can be sought from the party responsible for the release of the contaminant the assessment of natural resource damage nrd typically take place following cleanup because cleanup sometimes also effectively restore habitat during the second quarter of pepco became aware that the trustee are in the beginning stage of this process that often take many year beyond the remedial decision to
