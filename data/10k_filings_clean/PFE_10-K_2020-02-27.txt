demonstrating the value of our product is critical factor for success in all of our principal business our competitor include other worldwide research based biopharmaceutical company smaller research company with more limited therapeutic focus and generic and biosimilar drug manufacturer we compete with other company that manufacture and sell product that treat disease or indication similar to

and biosimilars manufacturer globally pfizer sell generic version of pfizer well certain competitor solid oral dose and sterile injectable pharmaceutical product we also sell biosimilars of certain inflammation immunology and oncology biologic medicine globally we seek to maximize the opportunity to establish first to market or early market position for our generic injectable drug and biosimilars first to market position provides customer lower cost alternative immediately when available and also may provide with potentially higher level of sale and profitability other generic or biosimilar competitor enter the market managed care organizationsthe evolution of managed care in the ha been major factor in the competitive makeup of the healthcare marketplace approximately million people in the now have some form of health insurance coverage due to the expansion of health insurance coverage see the item business government regulation and price constraint in the united state section in this form the marketing of prescription drug to both consumer and the entity that manage this expanded coverage in the continues to grow in importance the influence of mcos ha increased in recent year due to the growing number of patient receiving coverage through mcos at the time those organization have been consolidating into fewer even larger entity this consolidation enhances both their ability to negotiate well their importance to pfizer the growth of mcos ha increased pressure on drug price well revenue one objective of mcos is to contain and where possible reduce healthcare expenditure mcos typically negotiate price with pharmaceutical provider by using pfizer inc form of contentsformularies which are list of approved medicine available to member of the mcos clinical protocol requiring prior authorization for branded product if generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic product before permitting access to branded medicine volume purchasing long term contract and their ability to influence volume and market share of prescription drug in addition by placing branded medicine on higher tier status in their formulary leading to higher patient co pay or non preferred tier status mcos transfer portion of the cost of the medicine to the patient resulting in significant out of pocket expense for the patient especially for chronic treatment this financial disincentive is tool for mcos to manage drug cost and channel patient to medicine preferred by the mcos mcos also use additional measure such new to market block exclusion list indication based pricing and copay accumulator program to improve their cost containment effort we are closely monitoring these newer approach and developing appropriate strategy to respond to them due to their generally lower cost generic medicine typically are placed in lowest cost tier of mco formulary the breadth of the product covered by formulary can vary considerably from one mco to another and many formulary include alternative and competitive product for treatment of particular medical problem exclusion of product from formulary or other mco implemented restriction can significantly impact drug usage in the mco patient population and beyond consequently pharmaceutical company compete to gain access to formulary for their product unique product feature such greater efficacy better patient ease of use or fewer side effect are generally beneficial to achieving access to formulary however lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor we have been generally although not universally successful in our major product included on mco formulary however increasingly our branded product are being placed on the higher tier or in non preferred status mcos also emphasize primary and preventive care out patient treatment and procedure performed at doctor office and clinic another way to manage cost hospitalization and surgery typically the most expensive form of treatment are carefully managed since the use of certain drug can reduce the need for hospitalization professional therapy or even surgery such drug can become favored first line treatment for certain disease the aca ha accelerated payment reform by distributing risk across mcos and other stakeholder in care delivery with the intent of improving quality while reducing cost which creates pressure on mcos to tie reimbursement to defined outcome for additional information see the item business government regulation and price constraint in the united state healthcare reform section in this form generic productsone of the biggest competitive challenge that our branded product face is from generic pharmaceutical manufacturer upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for product especially small molecule product we can lose the major portion of revenue for that product in very short period of time several competitor make regular practice of challenging our product patent before their expiration generic competitor often operate without large expense well without cost of conveying medical information about product to the medical community in addition the fda approval process exempts generic from costly and time consuming clinical trial to demonstrate their safety and efficacy allowing generic manufacturer to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product generic competitor can market competing version of our product after the expiration or loss of our patent and often charge much le in china for example we are expected to face further intensified competition by certain generic manufacturer in which may result in price cut and volume loss of some of our product in addition our patent protected product can face competition in the form of generic version of competitor branded product that lose their market exclusivity noted above mcos that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drug often favor generic over brand name drug many government also encourage the use of generic alternative to brand name drug in their healthcare program including medicaid in the law in the generally allow and in some case require pharmacist to substitute for brand name drug generic drug that have been rated under government procedure to be chemically and therapeutically equivalent to brand name drug in small subset of state prescribing physician are able to expressly prevent such substitution favoring generic may reduce sale of our branded product raw materialsraw material essential to our business are purchased worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous supplier in general these material are available from multiple source in we experienced periodic shortage of select material

outweigh it known risk and effective then the fda will approve the product for marketing issuing new drug application or biologics license application appropriate company seeking to market generic prescription drug must scientifically demonstrate that the generic drug is bioequivalent to the innovator drug the abbreviated new drug application or generic drug application must show among other thing that the generic drug is pharmaceutically equivalent to the brand the manufacturer is capable of making the drug correctly and the proposed label is the same that of the innovator brand drug

product recall seizure delay in product approval injunction fine civil penalty and or criminal prosecution biosimilar regulation the aca created framework for the approval of biosimilars also known follow on biologics following the expiration of year of exclusivity for the innovator biologic with potential six month pediatric extension under the aca biosimilar application may not be submitted until four year after the approval of the reference innovator biologic the fda is responsible for implementation of the legislation and approval of new biosimilars through fda approval and the issuance of draft and final guidance the fda ha addressed number of issue related to the biosimilars approval pathway such the labeling expectation for biosimilars for example in the fda issued final guidance regarding the standard for demonstrating interchangeability with licensed reference product in addition in the biosimilar user fee act wa reauthorized for five year period which led to significant increase in the fda biosimilar user fee revenue thereby providing the fda with additional resource to process biosimilar application for example since the enactment of the newly authorized fee structure the fda estimate it revenue from biosimilar user fee generally will exceed million sale and marketing law and regulation the marketing practice of biopharmaceutical company are generally subject to various federal and state healthcare law that are intended among other thing to prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and to protect the integrity of government healthcare program these law include anti kickback law and false claim law anti kickback law generally prohibit biopharmaceutical company from soliciting offering receiving or paying anything of value to generate business including purchasing or prescribing of particular product false claim law generally prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting or causing to be presented any claim for payment for good including drug or biologics or service to third party payer including medicare and medicaid that are false or fraudulent and generally treat claim generated through kickback false or fraudulent violation of fraud and abuse law may be punishable by criminal or civil sanction and or exclusion from federal healthcare program including medicare and medicaid the federal government pfizer inc form of contentsand various state also have enacted law to regulate the sale and marketing practice of pharmaceutical company the law and regulation generally limit financial interaction between manufacturer and healthcare provider require disclosure to the federal or state government and the public of such interaction and or require the adoption of compliance standard or program many of these law and regulation contain ambiguous requirement or require administrative guidance for implementation individual state acting through their attorney general have become active well seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription drug under state consumer protection and false advertising law given the lack of clarity in law and their implementation our activity could be subject to the penalty under the pertinent law and regulation pricing and reimbursement pricing and reimbursement for our pharmaceutical product depends in part on government regulation pfizer must offer discounted pricing or rebate on purchase of pharmaceutical product under various federal and state healthcare program such the medicaid drug rebate program the federal ceiling price drug pricing program the drug pricing program and the medicare part program pfizer must also report specific price to government agency under healthcare program such the medicaid drug rebate program and medicare part the calculation necessary to determine the price reported are complex and the failure to report price accurately may expose pfizer to penalty see the discussion regarding rebate in the analysis of the consolidated statement of income revenue overview section and the note to consolidated financial statement note basis of presentation and significant accounting policy revenue and trade account receivable in our financial report which are incorporated by reference government and private third party payer routinely seek to manage utilization and control the cost of our product effort by government official or legislator to implement measure to regulate price or payment for pharmaceutical product including proposed action on drug importation could adversely affect our business if implemented there continues to be considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and measure to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceutical are being considered by congress the presidential administration and select state for example recent legislation revised how manufacturer calculate the average manufacturer price on branded drug with authorized generic under the medicaid drug rebate program which the congressional budget office ha estimated will reduce medicaid cost by over billion over the next decade proposal for even more far reaching reform such immediately eliminating or phasing out private health insurance are being proposed by some democratic candidate for president in particular several state have enacted or are considering transparency law that require prescription drug manufacturer to report to the state and make public price increase and sometimes to provide written justification for the increase in addition to new state transparency law and the introduction of several federal pricing bill we have also seen the presidential administration introduce proposal related to importation and express interest in international reference pricing in medicare part we expect to see continued focus in regulating pricing resulting in additional legislation and regulation that could adversely impact revenue in addition government action to reduce federal spending on entitlement program including medicare and medicaid may affect payment for our product or service associated with the provision of our product for additional information see the item risk factor entitlement reform section in this form also the majority of state use preferred drug list to restrict access to certain pharmaceutical product under medicaid restriction exist for some pfizer product under certain state medicaid program another example access to our product under the medicaid managed care program is typically determined by the health plan with which state medicaid agency contract to provide service to medicaid beneficiary state continue to explore option for controlling healthcare cost related to medicaid and other state healthcare program including the implementation of supplemental rebate agreement under the medicaid drug rebate program that are tied to patient outcome in addition we expect that consolidation and integration among pharmacy chain and wholesaler who collectively are the primary purchaser of our pharmaceutical product in the and pbms will increase pricing pressure on pharmaceutical manufacturer including for additional information see the item risk factor managed care trend section in this form the potential for additional pricing and access pressure in the commercial sector continues to be significant many employer have adopted high deductible health plan which can increase out of pocket cost for medicine this is trend that is likely to continue private third party payer such health plan increasingly challenge pharmaceutical product pricing which could result in lower price lower reimbursement rate and reduction in demand for our product pricing pressure for our product may occur result of highly competitive insurance market healthcare provider purchaser directly or through group purchasing organization are seeking enhanced discount or implementing more rigorous bidding or purchasing review process overall there is increasing pressure on provider to deliver healthcare at lower cost and to ensure that those expenditure deliver demonstrated value in term of health outcome longer term we are seeing shift in focus away from fee for service payment towards outcome based payment and risk sharing arrangement that reward provider for cost reduction and improved patient outcome these new payment model can at time lead to lower price for and restricted access to new medicine at the same time these model can also promote utilization of drug by encouraging physician to screen and diagnose and consider drug mean of forestalling more costly medical intervention we believe medicine are the most efficient and effective use of healthcare dollar based on the value they deliver to the overall healthcare system we work with law maker and advocate for solution that effectively improve patient health outcome lower cost to the healthcare system and ensure access to medicine within an efficient and affordable healthcare system in addition in response to the evolving and global healthcare spending landscape we work with health authority health technology assessment and quality measurement body and major payer throughout the product development process to better pfizer inc form of contentsunderstand how these entity value our compound and product further we seek to develop stronger internal capability focused on demonstrating the value of the medicine that we discover or develop register and manufacture by recognizing pattern of usage of our medicine and competitor medicine along with pattern of healthcare cost healthcare reform there have been significant effort at the federal and state level to reform the healthcare system by enhancing access to healthcare improving the delivery of healthcare and further rationalizing payment for healthcare we face uncertainty due to federal legislative and administrative effort to repeal substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provision of the aca there is additional uncertainty given the ruling in december by the circuit court of appeal for the fifth circuit in texas azar that the individual mandate which is significant provision of the aca is unconstitutional the case ha been remanded to lower court to determine whether the individual mandate is inseparable from the entire aca in which case the aca whole would be rendered unconstitutional in the meantime the remaining provision of the law remain in effect the revenue generated for pfizer by the health insurance exchange and medicaid expansion under the aca are not material so the impact of full invalidation of the law is expected to be limited however any future replacement for the aca may adversely affect our business and financial result particularly if the legislation reduces incentive for employer sponsored insurance coverage or dramatically increase industry tax and fee any future healthcare reform effort may adversely affect our business and financial result anti corruption the fcpa prohibits corporation and their representative from offering promising authorizing or making payment to any foreign government official government staff member political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad the scope of the fcpa includes interaction with certain healthcare professional in many country other country have enacted similar anti corruption law and or regulation data privacy pfizer collect personal data part of it regular business activity the collection and use of this data is subject to privacy and data security law and regulation including oversight by various regulatory or other governmental body for example we are subject to the california consumer privacy act ccpa the ccpa which came into effect on january imposes numerous obligation on including duty to disclose the category of personal data that we collect sell or share about california consumer and give those consumer right regarding their personal data noncompliance with any of these law could result in the imposition of fine penalty or order to stop non compliant activity and could damage our reputation and harm our business outside the united state we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issue in most country outside the new drug approval in the eu the approval of new drug may be achieved using the mutual recognition procedure the decentralized procedure or the eu centralized procedure these procedure apply in the eu member state plus the european economic area country norway iceland and liechtenstein the centralized procedure managed by the ema result in one single authorization for the whole eu which provides the most rapid and efficient mean of gaining approval across the eu and is the one most commonly used for new product in china the regulatory system historically presented numerous challenge for the pharmaceutical industry it requirement for drug development and registration were often inconsistent with or other international standard in recent year however china ha introduced reform and draft reform which are discussed in more detail below that attempt to address these challenge furthermore in the china regulatory authority the national medical product administration nmpa became member of the international council for harmonization ich which ha resulted in greater adoption of international technical guideline and practice by the government wa another active year in this respect with number of reform coming into effect and more proposal and draft being issued for consultation in japan the pmda is the point of entry for business looking to sell drug in the country the pmda which is involved in wide range of regulatory activity including clinical study approval postmarketing review and pharmaceutical safety must approve an application before new drug product may be marketed in japan the pmda also offer consultation on clinical trial of new drug and provides advice on product classification and approval health authority in many middle and lower income country require marketing approval by recognized regulatory authority similar to the authority of the fda or the ema before they begin to conduct their application review process and or issue their final approval many authority also require local clinical data in the country population in order to receive final marketing approval pharmacovigilance in the eu the ema pharmacovigilance risk assessment committee ha the responsibility for reviewing and making recommendation on product safety issue for the eu authority eu regulator may require pharmaceutical company to conduct post authorization safety and efficacy study at the time of approval or at any time afterwards in light of scientific development there are also additional extensive requirement regarding adverse drug reaction reporting and additional monitoring of product outside developed market such the eu and japan pharmacovigilance requirement vary and are generally not extensive but there is trend toward increasing regulation pfizer inc form of contentspricing and reimbursement certain government including the different eu member state the china japan canada south korea and some other international market provide healthcare at low to zero direct cost to consumer at the point of care and have significant power large single payer to regulate pharmaceutical price or patient reimbursement level to control cost for the government sponsored healthcare system particularly under recent global financing pressure government may use variety of cost containment measure for our pharmaceutical product including price cut mandatory rebate health technology assessment forced localization condition of market access international reference pricing the practice of country linking it regulated medicine price to those of other country quality consistency evaluation process and volume based procurement in addition the international patchwork of price regulation and differing economic condition and incomplete value assessment across country ha led to varying access to quality medicine in many market and some third party trade in our product between country in particular international reference pricing add to the regional impact of price cut in individual country and hinders patient access and innovation price variation exacerbated by international reference pricing system also have resulted from exchange rate fluctuation the downward pricing pressure resulting from this dynamic can be expected to continue result of reform to international reference pricing policy and measure targeting pharmaceutical in some european country in addition several important multilateral organization such the united nation including the world health organization who and the organization for economic cooperation and development are increasing scrutiny of international pharmaceutical pricing through issuing report and policy recommendation in the who continued exerting pressure on pharmaceutical pricing practice by supporting strategy to reduce medicine price including calling for greater transparency around the cost of research and development and production of medicine well disclosure of net price in japan the pricing environment for innovative medicine further deteriorated in with the introduction of health technology assessment hta system to inform price adjustment of healthcare technology after launch expansion of this system for reimbursement decision seen in other hta market remains risk while significant challenge remain the drug pricing reform package unlike the last reform package in is not expected to fundamentally change the access landscape furthermore the eligibility criterion for the price maintenance premium key policy that protects against price erosion for certain product is expected to be somewhat enhanced while expedited regulatory pathway are codified in law in canada the patented medicine price review board pmprb released draft guideline to implement new pricing regulation in november which will go into force in july these regulation drop the from the reference basket of country used to determine price and add economic factor for setting ceiling price for new medicine an initial analysis of the potential impact of these proposed change to the pmprb regulation estimated an approximately billion reduction in industry revenue over the next decade china pricing pressure in china healthcare is largely driven by public payer system with public medical insurance the largest single payer for pharmaceutical and pricing pressure have increased in recent year government official have consistently emphasized the importance of improved health outcome the need for healthcare reform and decreased drug price key indicator of progress towards reform while the government provides basic health insurance for the vast majority of chinese citizen that insurance is not adequate to cover many innovative medicine and alternative funding source for innovative medicine remain suboptimal in china government negotiated with company to add approximately innovative drug mainly oncology medicine to the national reimbursement drug list this build on drug already added through negotiation in and price for drug have been reduced dramatically through this government led process while these negotiation have included path to access for company market access is not assured in addition significant question about the process and negotiation for provincial tendering remain well the need for multi layered negotiation across provincial municipal and hospital level in the off patent space in china began to implement quality consistency evaluation qce process in order to improve the quality of domestically manufactured generic drug primarily by requiring such drug to pas test to ass their bioequivalence to qualified reference drug typically the originator drug in numerous local generic were officially deemed bioequivalent under qce pilot project for centralized volume based procurement vbp wa then initiated including molecule of drug covering major chinese city under this procurement model tender process ha been established where certain portion of included molecule volume are guaranteed to tender winner the program is intended to contain healthcare cost by driving utilization of generic that have passed qce which ha resulted in dramatic price cut for off patent medicine upjohn and most off patent originator were not successful in the first bidding process under this pilot which wa finalized in december and implemented in march and most contract went to local generic company the first bidding process resulted in significant price cut by the successful bidder with some bidder reducing the price of their product by much percent company attempted to secure volume on the chinese pharmaceutical market the drug that lost the bidding were also requested to reduce their selling price up to percent based on the price difference with the successful bidder china government began nationwide expansion of the vbp pilot in december the expanded model which is being implemented nationwide applies to certain drug that are purchased for public hospital well some military and private medical institution in the first bidding process our upjohn business unit and most originator brand were not successful in pfizer inc form of contentsthe bidding process for this nationwide expansion and those contract mostly went to local chinese generic company the qce qualified generic maker of atorvastatin and amlodipine bid aggressively lowering price even further from the march tender our upjohn business unit continues to take step to mitigate the revenue impact of these initiative but anticipates that they will continue to affect our upjohn business in china in the future we expect to utilize our presence in the retail channel private hospital and tendering capability to mitigate some of these pricing pressure in addition we believe that our geographic expansion to under penetrated and lower tiered city and county and additional focus on non tendered product will increase sale volume in greater china and partially mitigate pressure from qce in late china announced another round of expansion of the national vbp program which cover new molecule including biopharma zithromax tablet and diflucan tablet and no upjohn product biopharma wa not successful in the bidding process for this expansion furthermore the chinese government ha discussed moving toward effort to unify the reimbursement price between qce approved generic medicine and the applicable original medicine the government currently plan to implement this universal reimbursement price initiative within the next two to three year if this policy is implemented the new reimbursement level for upjohn product will likely be lower than the current reimbursement level placing additional pressure on price and or patient copays there remains uncertainty to whether when and how this policy may be officially implemented the chinese government could also enact other policy that may increase pricing pressure or have the effect of reducing the volume of sale available to upjohn product this potential policy and any other policy like it that could increase pricing and copay pressure on upjohn drug product in china could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation the government ha indicated that additional post loe drug could be subjected to qce qualification in future round which could also be tied to volume based procurement the scope of future qce product and timing of any program expansion is currently unknown making it difficult to determine the impact on pfizer business and financial condition we will continue to monitor the market for development eu regulatory change the eu adopted new clinical trial regulation in may but it implementation ha been delayed by the need for the eu authority to establish new technical system this regulation is aimed at simplifying and harmonizing the administrative process and governance of clinical trial in the eu and will require increased public posting of clinical trial result it is currently not anticipated to be fully implemented until the first half of at the earliest brexit in june the electorate voted in referendum to leave the eu which is commonly referred to brexit the left the eu on january with status quo arrangement through transition period scheduled to end on december the consequence of the leaving the eu and the term of the future trading relationship continue to be highly uncertain which may pose certain implication to our research commercial and general business operation in the and the eu including the approval and supply of our product however both the and the eu have issued detailed guidance for the industry on how medicine medical device and clinical trial will be separately regulated in their respective territory pfizer ha substantially completed it preparation for brexit having made the change necessary to meet relevant regulatory requirement in the eu and the through the transition period and afterwards especially in the regulatory research manufacturing and supply chain area between and we expect to spend up to approximately million in one time cost to make these adaptation for additional information on brexit see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook the global economic environment section in our financial report china regulatory change in an effort to encourage drug innovation and reduce backlog for existing application for drug approval in recent year the nmpa ha unveiled numerous reform initiative for china drug approval system and engaged in significant effort to build it capability the nmpa divide drug into new drug and generic with the definition for new drug changed from china new to global new this mean that drug previously approved in other market such the or europe are not considered new drug under china regulatory regime this change in definition creates more opportunity for china domestic drug manufacturer than for multinational firm because multinational firm have historically had significant competitive advantage in successfully achieving regulatory approval for drug first approved outside of china revision in made clear however that regulatory approval from the fda or the ema would no longer be required for approval of imported drug though notable exception persists for imported vaccine which still require prior approval from reference regulatory agency such the fda in china published revision to it drug administration law and introduced marketing authorization holder system which grant the nmpa more authority over regulating manufacturer and provides manufacturer more flexibility in contract manufacturing arrangement and manufacturing site transfer while challenge remain number of other policy change are streamlining and accelerating approval of domestic and imported drug in china these reform along with china june elevation to the ich management committee are expected to pave the way for integration of chinese regulation with global practice these change include introducing more streamlined process for maintaining renewal of product registration reduction in importing testing requirement and establishing an expedited registration pathway for drug to treat rare disease and serious life threatening illness with no effective treatment though certain detail on implementation are unclear evolving list of qualified rare disease and no guidance on qualifies serious life threatening the nmpa aim to build expedited pathway for certain category of product similar to the and european regulatory system additionally the nmpa published change to china registration requirement that align more with international practice including day review timeline for clinical trial authorization and pfizer inc form of contentsguidance for acceptance of foreign clinical data and the utilization of real world data in drug development and regulatory decision making although number of regulatory change better support china inclusion in simultaneous global drug development unique regulatory requirement continue to pose challenge for multinational company including china human genetic resource process for exporting clinical trial sample which add month to starting clinical trial in china mismatched china pharmacopoeia and manufacturing data requirement that require standard exceeding acceptable practice in the eu and japan and unpredictable and inconsistent clinical trial inspection practice healthcare provider transparency and disclosure number of country have implemented law requiring or their industry association have recommended disclosure of transfer of value made by pharmaceutical company to healthcare provider for example the european federation of pharmaceutical industry and association disclosure code requires all member including pfizer to disclose transfer of value to healthcare professional and healthcare organization intellectual property the world trade organization agreement on trade related aspect of intellectual property right wto trip required participant country to amend their intellectual property law to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical product by with an extension until for least developed country while we still face patent grant enforcement and other intellectual property challenge around the world some country have made improvement we include stronger patent protection among the factor we consider for continued business expansion in other participant country while the global intellectual property environment ha generally improved following wto trip and bilateral multilateral trade agreement our future business growth depends on further progress in intellectual property protection in emerging market country in particular government have used intellectual property policy tool to force innovator to accept le than fair value for medicine well to protect their local pharmaceutical industry considerable political and economic pressure exists to weaken current intellectual property protection and resist implementation of any further protection which ha led to policy such more restrictive standard for obtaining patent and more difficult procedure for patenting biopharmaceutical invention restriction on patenting certain type of invention new medical treatment method revocation of patent law or regulation that promote or provide broad discretion to issue compulsory license weak intellectual property enforcement and failure to implement effective regulatory data protection our industry advocacy effort focus on seeking more balanced business environment for foreign manufacturer well on underscoring the importance of strong intellectual property system for local innovative industry and helping improve patient access to innovative medicine in developed country well including the eu we are facing an increasingly challenging intellectual property environment part of the canada eu comprehensive economic trade agreement ceta canada now provides sui generis protection commonly referred to patent term restoration for patent term extension for basic patent however the extension is capped at two year whereas the international norm is five year in addition the implementing regulation may create obstacle for patentee applying for patent term restoration via certificate of supplementary protection csp and canada proposed drug pricing reform may negatively impact the benefit of csp furthermore the united state mexico canada agreement usmca will when implemented require canada and mexico to make certain improvement to their current intellectual property regime including the establishment of patent term adjustment for unreasonable delay in the grant of patent in china the intellectual property environment ha improved in recent year although effective enforcement and adequate legal remedy remain area of concern the government ha taken step to protect intellectual property right in conformity with world trade organization provision although china remained on the trade representative priority watch list for due to ongoing enforcement challenge and china failure to make certain structural reform further the standard for patentability in china remain more restrictive than in other major market including the europe and japan also while framework exists for protecting patent for year enforcement mechanism are often lacking or inconsistent for example the absence of effective patent linkage mechanism and preliminary injunction impractical evidentiary burden and heightened sufficiency standard have been used to invalidate patent at the enforcement stage in the regulatory authority granted marketing approval to generic product while the reference product in each case are still subject to patent protection and there is no effective legal mean to resolve patent dispute prior to the marketing of those infringing drug the and china recently signed an initial agreement in which china ha committed to address some patent related concern and both government have indicated that they will continue bilateral discussion on implementation of these commitment and other intellectual property issue in in brazil and other latin american country the role of health regulatory authority in reviewing patent national health surveillance agency in brazil restrictive patentability rule ambiguity regarding the term of certain patent and backlog at patent agency may limit our ability to protect our product through patent the lack of regulatory data protection and difficulty in protecting certain type of invention such new medical us of drug product may limit the commercial lifespan of some pharmaceutical product additionally an increased threat of issuance of compulsory license for biopharmaceutical product exists which add to business uncertainty in india we have seen some progress in term of expediting patent approval process to reduce pendency rate and implementing training program to enhance enforcement despite these positive step gap remain in term of addressing longstanding intellectual property concern for example policy favoring compulsory licensing of patent the tendency of the pfizer inc form of contentsindian patent office to revoke pharmaceutical patent in opposition proceeding both pre and post grant and restrictive standard for patentability of pharmaceutical product have made it difficult to safeguard many of our invention and our investment in innovation these policy heighten the risk of additional patent challenge targeting innovative pharmaceutical product especially in area perceived being important to the public health of the population challenge against pfizer patent in india are ongoing data privacy outside of the many country where we conduct business including the eu have privacy and data security law and regulation concerning the collection and use of personal

related to our business industry and operation managed care trendsprivate third party payer such health plan and other managed care entity such pbms continue to take action to manage the utilization of drug and control the cost of drug consolidation among mcos ha increased the negotiating power of mcos and other private third party payer private third party payer well government increasingly employ formulary to control cost by taking into account discount in connection with decision about formulary inclusion or favorable formulary placement failure to obtain or maintain timely or adequate pricing or favorable formulary placement for our product or failure to obtain such formulary placement at favorable pricing could adversely impact revenue private third party payer often implement formulary with copayment tier to encourage utilization of certain drug and have also been raising co payment required from beneficiary particularly for branded pharmaceutical and biotechnology product private third party payer are also implementing new initiative like so called copay accumulator policy that provide that the value of copay assistance doe not count out of pocket cost that are applied toward deductible that can shift more of the cost burden to manufacturer and patient this cost shifting ha increased consumer interest and input in medication choice they pay for larger portion of their prescription cost and may cause consumer to favor lower cost generic alternative to branded pharmaceutical third party payer also use additional measure such new to market block exclusion list indication based pricing and value based pricing contracting to improve their cost containment effort and are also increasingly imposing utilization management tool such clinical protocol requiring prior authorization for branded product if generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic product before permitting access to branded medicine the private third party payer market consolidates further and more drug become available in generic form biopharmaceutical company may face greater pricing pressure from private third party payer who will continue to drive more of their patient to use lower cost generic alternative generic competitioncompetition from manufacturer of generic drug is major challenge for our branded product around the world and the loss or expiration of intellectual property right can have significant adverse effect on our revenue in addition our patented product may face generic competition before patent exclusivity expires including upon the at risk launch despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product by manufacturer of generic version of one of our patented product generic competition could lead to our loss of major portion of revenue for that product in very short period of time number of our product have experienced significant generic competition over the last few year for example lyrica product in our upjohn business lost patent protection in the in june and multi source generic competition began in july also the basic product patent for chantix in the will expire in november in china we are expected to face further intensified competition by certain generic manufacturer which may result in price cut and volume loss of some of our product also generic manufacturer have filed application with the fda seeking approval of product candidate that such company claim do not infringe our patent or that our patent are not valid these include candidate that would compete with among other product eliquis ibrance and xeljanz our licensing and collaboration partner also face challenge by generic drug manufacturer to patent covering product for which we have license or co promotion right in addition our patent protected product may face competition in the form of generic version of competitor branded product that lose their market exclusivity pfizer inc form of contentscompetitive productswe can not predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive product including new product entrant in line branded product generic product private label product biosimilars and product candidate that treat disease and condition similar to those treated by our in line drug and drug candidate the introduction of competitive product can result in erosion of the sale of our existing product and potential sale of product in development well unanticipated product obsolescence competitive product launch have occurred in recent year and certain potentially competitive product are in various stage of development some of these have been filed for approval with the fda and with regulatory authority in other country we also produce generic and biosimilar pharmaceutical product that compete with product from competitor including other generic and biosimilar manufacturer the ability to launch generic or biosimilar pharmaceutical product at or before the anticipated formation of the generic or biosimilar marketplace is important to that product profitability with increasing competition in the generic or biosimilar product market our success will depend on our ability to bring new product to market quickly the fda along with other regulatory agency around the world ha been experiencing backlog of generic drug application which may result in delayed approval of new generic product over the next few year also we may face access challenge for our biosimilar product where our product may not receive appropriate coverage reimbursement access or remains in disadvantaged position relative to the innovator product for example inflectra ha experienced access challenge among commercial payer in september pfizer filed suit in the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania against johnson johnson alleging that exclusionary contract and other anticompetitive practice concerning remicade infliximab violate federal antitrust law dependence on key in line productswe recorded direct product and or alliance revenue of more than billion for each of eight biopharmaceutical product in prevnar prevenar ibrance eliquis lyrica xeljanz lipitor enbrel and chantix champix those product accounted for of our total revenue in if these product or any of our other major product were to become subject to problem such loss of patent protection if applicable change in prescription growth rate material product liability litigation unexpected side effect regulatory proceeding publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence pressure from existing competitive product change in labeling pricing and access pressure supply shortage or if new more effective treatment should be introduced the adverse impact on our revenue could be significant number of our product have experienced patent based expiration or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain market in the last few year and patent covering number of our best selling medicine are or have been the subject of pending legal challenge for example result of patent litigation settlement teva pharmaceutical usa inc launched generic version of viagra product in our upjohn business in the in december in addition lyrica product in our upjohn business lost patent protection in the in june and multi source generic competition began in july also the basic product patent for chantix in the will expire in november in addition our revenue could be significantly impacted by the timing and rate of commercial acceptance of key new product for additional information see the item business patent and other intellectual property right section in this form further our alliance revenue will be adversely affected by the termination or expiration of collaboration and co promotion agreement that we have entered into and that we may enter into from time to time research and development investmentthe discovery and development of safe effective new product well the development of additional us for existing product are necessary for the continued strength of our business our product line must be replenished over time in order to offset revenue loss when product lose their market exclusivity well to provide for earnings growth our growth potential depends in large part on our ability to identify and develop new product or new indication for existing product that address unmet medical need and receive reimbursement from payer either through internal or through collaboration acquisition joint venture or licensing or other arrangement with third party however balancing current growth investment for future growth and the delivery of shareholder return remains major challenge the average cost of product development continue to rise do the regulatory requirement in many therapeutic area which may affect the number of candidate funded well the sustainability of the portfolio our ongoing investment in new product introduction and in for new product and existing product extension could exceed corresponding sale growth additionally our investment plan and resource may not be correctly matched between science and market and failure to invest in the right technology platform therapeutic segment product class geographic market and or in licensing and out licensing opportunity could adversely impact the productivity of our pipeline further even if the area with the greatest market attractiveness are identified the scientific approach may not succeed for any given program despite the significant investment required for and the commercial potential of the product may not be competitive expected because of the highly dynamic market environment and the hurdle in term of access and reimbursement we continue to strengthen our global organization and pursue strategy intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in to achieve sustainable pipeline that is positioned to deliver value in the near term and over time these strategy may not deliver the desired result which could affect growth and profitability in the future pfizer inc form of contentsbiosimilarsabbreviated legal pathway for the approval of biosimilars exist in many international market and since the passage of the aca framework for such approval exists in the if competitor are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing our biologic product our biologic product may become subject to competition from these biosimilars with attendant competitive pressure and price reduction could follow for example enbrel face ongoing biosimilar competition in most european market the loss of patent right due to patent expiration or litigation could trigger competition we are developing and commercializing biosimilar medicine risk related to our commercialization of biosimilars include the potential for steeper than anticipated price erosion due to increased competitive intensity coupled with intellectual property challenge that may preclude timely commercialization of our potential biosimilar product there is also risk of lower uptake for biosimilars due to various factor that may vary for different biosimilars anti competitive practice physician reluctance to prescribe biosimilars for existing patient taking the originator product or misaligned financial incentive see also the competitive product risk factor above research studiesdecisions about research study made early in the development process of drug or vaccine candidate can have substantial impact on the marketing strategy and payer reimbursement possibility if it receives regulatory approval for example wider range of study can lead to approval for broader set of indication that may impact the marketing and payer reimbursement process however each additional indication and it reimbursement potential must be balanced against the time and resource required to demonstrate benefit the increased complexity of development and manufacturing and the potential delay to approval of the lead indication we try to plan clinical trial prudently and to reasonably anticipate and address challenge but there is no guarantee that an optimal balance between trial conduct speed and desired outcome will be achieved each time the degree to which such potential challenge are foreseen and adequately addressed could affect our future result international operationsour international operation could be affected by currency fluctuation capital and exchange control economic condition expropriation and other restrictive government action change in intellectual property legal protection and remedy trade regulation and procedure and action affecting approval production pricing and marketing of reimbursement for and access to our product well by political unrest unstable government and legal system and inter governmental dispute any of these change could adversely affect our business many emerging market have experienced growth rate in excess of developed market leading to an increased contribution to the industry global performance result we have been employing strategy to grow in emerging market however our strategy in emerging market may not be successful and these country may not continue to sustain these growth rate for example even though china is growing faster than most emerging market we face certain challenge in china due to government imposed pricing control affecting certain pfizer medicine in addition some emerging market country may be particularly vulnerable to period of financial or political instability or significant currency fluctuation or may have limited resource for healthcare spending even though we constantly monitor the evolving emerging market for any unanticipated risk to pfizer certain financial or political event in such market can adversely affect our result specialty pharmaceuticalsspecialty pharmaceutical are medicine that treat rare or life threatening condition that typically have smaller patient population the growing availability and use of innovative specialty pharmaceutical combined with their relative higher cost compared to other type of pharmaceutical product ha generated payer interest in developing cost containment strategy targeted to this sector the impact of payer effort to control access to and pricing of specialty pharmaceutical is increasing number of factor create more challenging paradigm for pfizer given our growing specialty business portfolio such formulary restriction and increasing use of utilization management tool such step edits which can lead to higher negotiated rebate or discount to health plan and pbms in the well the increasing use of health technology assessment and government pressure in market around the world product manufacturing sale and marketing risksdifficulties or delay in product manufacturing sale or marketing could affect future result through regulatory action shut down work stoppage or strike approval delay withdrawal recall penalty supply disruption shortage or stock out reputational harm product liability or unanticipated cost example of such difficulty or delay include but are not limited to the inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand the failure to predict market demand for or to gain market acceptance of approved product the possibility that the supply of component material is delayed or unavailable and that the quality of such material are substandard and not detected the possibility that we may fail to maintain appropriate quality standard throughout our internal and external supply network and or comply with cgmps and other applicable regulation such serialization which allows for track and trace of product in the supply chain to enhance patient safety pfizer inc form of contentsrisks to supply chain continuity and commercial operation result of natural including hurricane earthquake and flood or man made disaster including arson or terrorist attack at our facility or at supplier or vendor including those that may be related to climate change failure to maintain the integrity of our supply chain against economic adulteration product diversion product theft counterfeit good and cyberattacks an example we have been experiencing production issue with genotropin that will decrease revenue from that product regulatory agency periodically inspect our drug manufacturing facility to evaluate compliance with cgmp or other applicable requirement failure to comply with these requirement may subject to possible legal or regulatory action such warning letter suspension of manufacturing seizure of product injunction debarment recall of product delay or denial of product approval import ban or denial of import certification any of which could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation in february for example we received warning letter from the fda communicating the fda view that certain violation of cgmp regulation exist at hospira manufacturing facility in mcpherson kansa we undertook corrective action to address the concern raised by the fda in january the fda upgraded the status of pfizer mcpherson manufacturing facility to vai based on an october inspection the change to vai status lifted the compliance hold that the fda placed on approval of pending application in june the fda informed that it had completed an evaluation of corrective action and closed out the february warning letter issued to our mcpherson manufacturing facility after determining that we had addressed the violation contained in the warning letter in july august the fda conducted follow up inspection of our mcpherson facility and issued an inspection report noting several finding pfizer responded to the fda finding and is in the process of implementing corrective and preventive action plan to address the fda concern on the basis of the july august fda inspection the fda changed the inspection classification of the mcpherson site to official action indicated oai future fda inspection and regulatory activity will further ass the adequacy and sustainability of these correction implemented at the site communication with the fda on the status of the mcpherson site is ongoing result of the current oai classification the fda may refuse to grant premarket approval of application and or the fda may refuse to grant export certificate related to product manufactured at our mcpherson site until the site status is upgraded which upgrade would be based on re inspection by the fda we have been experiencing shortage of product from the legacy hospira portfolio among others largely driven by capacity constraint technical issue supplier quality concern or unanticipated increase in demand we have made considerable progress in remediating issue at legacy hospira facility manufacturing sterile injectables and have substantially improved supply from most of these site continuing product shortage interruption at these manufacturing facility could negatively impact our financial result in addition in september meridian medical technology inc subsidiary of pfizer inc received warning letter from the fda asserting the fda view that certain violation of cgmp and quality system regulation exist at meridian manufacturing site in st louis missouri and classifying the site oai meridian responded to the warning letter and committed to making improvement across the site we have made considerable progress addressing the concern raised by the fda and communication with the fda is ongoing future fda inspection and regulatory activity will further ass the adequacy and sustainability of these correction implemented at the site result of the oai classification the fda may refuse to grant premarket approval of application and or the fda may refuse to grant export certificate related to product manufactured at our st louis site collaboration and other relationship with third party we depend on third party collaborator service provider and others in the research development manufacturing and commercialization of our product and product candidate and also enter into joint venture and other business development transaction in connection with our business to achieve expected longer term benefit we may make substantial upfront payment in such transaction which may negatively impact our reported earnings we rely heavily on these party for multiple aspect of our drug development manufacturing and commercialization activity but we do not control many aspect of those activity we also outsource certain service to other party including transaction processing accounting information technology manufacturing clinical trial recruitment and execution clinical lab service non clinical research safety service integrated facility management and other area failure by one or more of these third party to complete activity on schedule or in accordance with our expectation failure by one or more of these party to meet their contractual or other obligation to pfizer failure of one or more of these party to comply with applicable law or regulation or any disruption in the relationship between pfizer and one or more of these third party could delay or prevent the development approval manufacturing or commercialization of our product and product candidate could expose to suboptimal quality of service delivery or deliverable could result in repercussion such missed deadline or other timeliness issue erroneous data and supply disruption and could also result in non compliance with legal or regulatory requirement or industry standard or reputational harm all with potential negative implication for our product pipeline and business biopharmaceutical wholesalersin our largest biopharmaceutical wholesaler accounted for approximately of our total revenue and approximately of our total revenue and our top three biopharmaceutical wholesaler accounted for approximately of our total revenue and approximately of our total revenue if one of our significant biopharmaceutical wholesaler should encounter financial or other difficulty such wholesaler might decrease the amount of business that it doe with and we might be unable to collect all the amount that the wholesaler owes on timely basis or at all which could negatively impact pfizer inc form of contentsour result of operation in addition we expect that consolidation and integration of pharmacy chain and wholesaler will increase competitive and pricing pressure on pharmaceutical manufacturer including business development activitieswe expect to continue to enhance our in line product and product pipeline through various form of business development which can include alliance license joint venture collaboration equity or debt based investment disposition divestments merger and acquisition however these enhancement plan are subject to the availability and cost of appropriate opportunity competition from other pharmaceutical company that are seeking similar opportunity and our ability to successfully identify structure and execute transaction including the ability to satisfy the condition to closing of announced transaction in the anticipated timeframes or at all and successfully integrate acquisition pursuing these opportunity may require to obtain additional equity or debt financing and could result in increased leverage and or downgrade of our credit rating where we acquire debt or equity security all or part of the consideration for business development activity such in connection with our contribution agreement entered into with allogene therapeutic inc the value of those security will fluctuate and may depreciate in value we may not control the company in which we acquire security such in connection with divestiture or collaborative arrangement and result we will have limited ability to determine it management operational decision and policy further while we seek to mitigate risk and liability of such transaction through among other thing due diligence there may be risk and liability that such due diligence effort fail to discover that are not disclosed to or that we inadequately ass legal proceeding or regulatory issue often arise result of activity that occurred at acquired company their partner and other third party in for example we paid million to resolve allegation related to wyeth reporting of price to the government with respect to protonix for activity that occurred prior to our acquisition of wyeth for these and other reason we may not realize the anticipated benefit of such transaction and expected synergy and accretion may not be realized within the expected timeframes or at all counterfeit productsa counterfeit medicine is one that ha been deliberately and fraudulently mislabeled to it identity and source counterfeit pfizer medicine therefore is one manufactured by someone other than pfizer but which appears to be the same an authentic pfizer medicine the prevalence of counterfeit medicine is significant and growing industry wide issue due to variety of factor including but not limited to the following the widespread use of the internet which ha greatly facilitated the ease by which counterfeit medicine can be advertised purchased and delivered to individual patient the availability of sophisticated technology that make it easier for counterfeiter to make counterfeit medicine the growing involvement in the medicine supply chain of under regulated wholesaler and repackagers the lack of adequate inspection at certain international postal facility counterfeit medicine are increasingly delivered direct to customer in small parcel package the tendency to misuse and abuse medicine and the relatively modest risk of penalty faced by counterfeiter compared to the large profit that can be earned by them from the sale of counterfeit medicine further law against pharmaceutical counterfeiting vary greatly from country to country and the enforcement of existing law varies greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction for example in some country pharmaceutical counterfeiting is not crime in others it may result in only minimal sanction in addition those involved in the distribution of counterfeit medicine use complex transport route in order to evade custom control by disguising the true source of their product pfizer global reputation make it medicine prime target for counterfeiting organization counterfeit medicine continue to pose significant risk to patient health and safety because of the condition under which they are manufactured often in unregulated unlicensed uninspected and unsanitary site well the lack of regulation of their content counterfeiter have been recently evolving to counterfeit life sustaining medication such oncology medicine this shift significantly increase the risk to patient who for instance unsuspectingly purchase counterfeit oncology medication from illicit online pharmacy operated by criminal counterfeiting organization failure to mitigate this new threat posed by counterfeit biopharma medicine could adversely impact our business by among other thing causing the loss of patient confidence in the pfizer name and in the integrity of our medicine potentially resulting in lost sale product recall and an increased threat of litigation we have an enterprise wide strategy to counteract the threat associated with counterfeit medicine and focused on educating patient and health care provider to reduce demand through awareness increasing engagement and education of global law enforcement custom and regulatory agency about the growing prevalence of counterfeit life sustaining medicine enhancing online identification and disruption effort in partnership with pharmaceutical association to optimize resource and impact educating legislator about the risk to the security of the international drug supply chain by illicit manufacturing and distribution network operated by transnational criminal organization supporting effort by law enforcement authority to prosecute counterfeiter assessing new and existing technology to seek to make it more difficult for counterfeiter to copy our product and easier for patient and healthcare provider to distinguish authentic from counterfeit medicine and using data analytics and risk assessment tool to better target the factor that give rise to the counterfeiting problem in the first place however our effort and the effort of others may not be entirely successful and the presence of counterfeit medicine may continue to increase pfizer inc form of contentsrisks related to government regulation and legal proceeding pricing and reimbursementu and international governmental regulation that mandate price control and limitation on patient access to our product or establish price paid by government entity or program for our product impact our business and our future result could be adversely affected by change in such regulation or policy in the many of our product are subject to increasing pricing pressure pharmaceutical product pricing is subject to enhanced government and public scrutiny and call for reform some state have implemented and other state are considering pharmaceutical price control or patient access constraint under the medicaid program and some state are considering price control regime that would apply to broader segment of their population that are not medicaid eligible there have also been recent state legislative effort to address drug cost which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug cost or limiting drug price effort by government official or legislator to implement measure to regulate price or payment for pharmaceutical product including legislation on drug importation could adversely affect our business if implemented see the discussion regarding pricing and reimbursement in the item business government regulation and price constraint in the united state pricing and reimbursement section in this form we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issue in most other country in certain international market such the different eu member state the china japan canada and south korea government have significant power large single payer to regulate price access criterion through public or private health technology assessment or other mean of cost control particularly under recent global financing pressure result we expect that pressure on the pricing component of operating result will continue for example china in began to implement qce process under which numerous local generic have officially been deemed bioequivalents of qualified reference drug china government subsequently initiated pilot project for centralized vbp in which included molecule of drug and covered major chinese city under this procurement model tender process wa established whereby certain portion of included molecule volume were guaranteed to tender winner this tender process wa intended to contain healthcare cost by driving utilization of generic and bioequivalents that had passed qce and ha resulted in dramatic price cut for off patent medicine china government began nationwide expansion of the vbp pilot in december see the discussion regarding these government initiative in china in the item business government regulation and price constraint outside the united state china pricing pressure section in this form we anticipate that these initiative will continue to increase pricing pressure on our drug product in china in the future the adoption of restrictive price control in new jurisdiction or more restrictive one in existing jurisdiction or the failure to obtain or maintain timely or adequate pricing could also adversely impact revenue in our vaccine business we participate in tender process in many country for participation in national immunization program failure to secure participation in national immunization program or to obtain acceptable pricing in the tender process could adversely affect our business healthcare reformthe healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial change for example the aca wa enacted by congress in march and established major expansion of healthcare coverage financed in part by number of new rebate discount and tax that had significant effect on our expense and profitability see the discussion in the item business government regulation and price constraint in the united state section in this form we face uncertainty due to federal legislative and administrative effort to repeal substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provision of the aca there is additional uncertainty given the ruling in december by the circuit court of appeal for the fifth circuit in texas azar that the individual mandate which is significant provision of the aca is unconstitutional the case ha been remanded to lower court to determine whether the individual mandate is inseparable from the entire aca in which case the aca whole would be rendered unconstitutional in the meantime the remaining provision of the law remain in effect the revenue generated for pfizer by the health insurance exchange and medicaid expansion under the aca are not material so the impact of full invalidation of the law is expected to be limited however any future replacement of the aca may adversely affect our business and financial result particularly if the legislation reduces incentive for employer sponsored insurance coverage or dramatically increase industry tax and fee any future healthcare reform effort may adversely affect our business and financial result other federal or state legislative or regulatory action and or policy effort could adversely affect our business including among others general budget control action change in patent law the importation of prescription drug from outside the at price that are regulated by government of various foreign country which is among the presidential administration policy proposal revision to reimbursement of biopharmaceuticals under government program such the implementation of international reference pricing for medicare part drug or change to protected class criterion for part drug restriction on direct to consumer advertising limitation on interaction with healthcare professional or the use of comparative effectiveness methodology that could be implemented in manner that focus primarily on cost difference and minimizes the therapeutic difference among pharmaceutical product and restricts access to innovative medicine pfizer inc form of contentsu entitlement reformin the government action to reduce federal spending on entitlement program including medicare and medicaid may affect payment for our product or service provided using our product the congressional budget office routinely release option for reducing federal spending and the december release includes proposal to cap federal medicaid payment to the state and to require manufacturer to pay minimum rebate on drug covered under medicare part for low income beneficiary significant medicare reduction could also result if for example congress proceeds with certain proposal to convert the medicare fee for service program into premium support program or congress chooses to implement the recommendation made annually by the medicare payment advisory commission which are primarily intended to extend the fiscal solvency of the medicare program these and any other significant spending reduction or cost control affecting medicare medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health program that may be implemented could have an adverse impact on our result of operation substantial regulationwe are subject to extensive complex costly and evolving regulation by federal and state governmental authority in the principally by the fda and the dea and foreign regulatory authority failure to comply with all applicable regulatory requirement may subject to operating restriction and criminal prosecution monetary penalty and other disciplinary action including sanction warning letter product seizure recall fine injunction suspension revocation of approval corporate integrity or deferred prosecution agreement or exclusion from future participation in government healthcare program well reputational harm development regulatory approval and marketing of productsinnovation is critical to the success of our company and drug discovery and development are time consuming expensive and unpredictable the outcome of the lengthy and complex process of identifying new compound and developing new product is inherently uncertain and involves high degree of risk and cost the process from early discovery to design and adequate implementation of clinical trial to regulatory approval can take many year drug candidate can and do fail at any stage of the process including the result of unfavorable pre clinical and clinical trial result or unfavorable new clinical data and further analysis of existing clinical data including result that may not support further clinical development of the applicable product candidate or indication we may not be able to meet anticipated pre clinical or clinical endpoint commencement and or completion date for our pre clinical or clinical trial regulatory submission date regulatory approval date and or launch date similarly we may not be able to successfully address all of the comment received from regulatory authority such the fda and the ema or obtain approval from regulator regulatory approval of drug or biologic product depends on myriad factor including regulator making determination to whether product benefit outweigh it known risk and determination of the product efficacy additionally clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretation and assessment by regulatory authority even after drug or biologic is approved it could be adversely affected by regulatory decision impacting labeling manufacturing process safety and or other matter we may not be able to receive or maintain favorable recommendation by technical or advisory committee such the advisory committee on immunization practice that may impact the use of our vaccine further claim and concern that may arise regarding the safety and efficacy of in line product and product candidate can result in negative impact on product sale product recall or withdrawal and or consumer fraud product liability and other litigation and claim increasing regulatory scrutiny of drug safety and efficacy with regulatory authority increasingly focused on product safety and the risk benefit profile of product they relate to already approved product ha resulted in more challenging expensive and lengthy regulatory approval process due to request for among other thing additional or more extensive clinical trial prior to granting approval or increased post approval requirement for these and other reason discussed in item risk factor we may not obtain the approval we expect within the timeframe we anticipate or at all post approval dataas condition to granting marketing approval of product the fda may require company to conduct additional clinical trial the result generated in these phase trial could result in the loss of marketing approval change in product labeling and or new or increased concern about the side effect or efficacy of product regulatory agency in country outside the often have similar authority and may impose comparable requirement for example in july and december the fda updated the prescribing information for xeljanz to include three additional boxed warning well change to the indication and dosing for ulcerative colitis in january the ema revised the summary of product characteristic smpc for xeljanz to include new warning and recommendation for use of xeljanz due to an increased risk of venous thromboembolism and due to an increased risk of infection revised warning in patient older than year of age these update were based on the fda and ema review of data from the ongoing post marketing requirement rheumatoid arthritis study postmarketing study whether conducted by or by others and whether mandated by regulatory agency or voluntary and other emerging data about marketed product such adverse event report may also adversely affect the availability or commercial potential of our product further the discovery of significant problem with product similar to one of our product could implicate the entire class of product and this in turn could have an adverse effect on the availability or commercial viability of our product well other product in the class pfizer inc form of contentsinteractions with healthcare professional and government officialsrisks and uncertainty apply if we provide offer or promise something of value to healthcare professional other healthcare provider and or government official requirement or industry standard in the and certain jurisdiction abroad that require pharmaceutical manufacturer to track and disclose financial interaction with healthcare professional and healthcare provider increase government and public scrutiny of such financial interaction if an interaction is found to be improper government enforcement action and penalty could result these risk may increase both and foreign enforcement agency adopt or increase enforcement effort in respect of existing and new law and regulation governing product promotion marketing anti bribery and kickback industry regulation and code of conduct change in law and accounting standardsour future result could be adversely affected by change in interpretation of existing law and regulation or change in law and regulation including among others change in accounting standard taxation requirement including tax rate change new tax law change to existing tax law and revised tax law and regulatory clarification and or interpretation including change affecting the taxation by the of income earned outside the that may result from pending and possible future proposal including further clarification and or interpretation of or change to the tax cut and job act of competition law privacy law and environmental law in the and other country for additional information see the provision benefit for tax on income change in tax law and new accounting standard section and the note to consolidated financial statement note basis of presentation and significant accounting policy adoption of new accounting standard in in our financial report legal proceedingswe and certain of our subsidiary are involved in various legal proceeding including patent litigation such claim that our patent are invalid and or do not cover the product of the generic drug manufacturer or where one or more third party seek damage and or injunctive relief to compensate for alleged infringement of it patent by our commercial or other activity product liability and other product related litigation including personal injury consumer off label promotion security antitrust and breach of contract claim commercial environmental government investigation employment tax litigation and other legal proceeding including various mean for resolving asbestos litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdict do occur although we believe that our claim and defense in matter in which we are defendant are substantial we could in the future incur judgment enter into settlement or revise our expectation regarding the outcome of certain matter and such development could have material adverse effect on our result of operation in the period in which the amount are accrued and or our cash flow in the period in which the amount are paid claim against our patent include challenge to the coverage and or validity of our patent on various product or process although we believe we have substantial defense to these challenge with respect to all of our material patent there can be no assurance to the outcome of these matter and loss in any of these case could result in loss of patent protection for the product at issue which could lead to significant loss of sale of that product and could materially affect future result of operation like other pharmaceutical company we are subject to extensive regulation by government agency in the other developed market and multiple emerging market in which we operate criminal charge substantial fine and or civil penalty limitation on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdiction corporate integrity or deferred prosecution agreement well reputational harm and increased public interest in the matter could result from government investigation in the and other jurisdiction in which we do business in addition in qui tam lawsuit in which the government decline to intervene the relator may still pursue suit for the recovery of civil damage and penalty on behalf of the government our activity relating to the sale and marketing and the pricing of our product are subject to extensive regulation under the ffdca the medicaid drug rebate program the fcpa and other federal and state statute including those discussed elsewhere in this form well anti kickback and false claim law and similar law in international jurisdiction like many company in our industry we have from time to time received inquiry and subpoena and other type of information demand from government authority and been subject to claim and other action related to our business activity brought by governmental authority well by consumer and private payer in some instance we have incurred significant expense civil payment fine and other adverse consequence result of these claim action and inquiry for example these claim action and inquiry may relate to alleged failure to accurately interpret or identify or prevent non compliance with the law and regulation associated with the dissemination of product information approved and unapproved potentially resulting in government enforcement and damage to our reputation this risk may be heightened by digital marketing including social medium mobile application and blogger outreach in connection with the resolution of government investigation concerning independent copay assistance organization that provide financial assistance to medicare patient in may we entered into corporate integrity agreement cia with the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human service which is effective for period of five pfizer inc form of contentsyears in the cia we agreed to implement and or maintain certain compliance program element to promote compliance with federal healthcare program requirement breach of the cia could result in severe sanction against for additional information including information regarding certain legal proceeding in which we are involved in see the note to consolidated financial statement note contingency and certain commitment legal proceeding in our financial report environmental claim and proceedingswe and certain of our subsidiary are subject to numerous contingency arising in the ordinary course of business relating to environmental claim and proceeding amount recorded for legal and environmental contingency can result from complex series of judgment about future event and uncertainty and can rely heavily on estimate and assumption while we have accrued for worldwide environmental liability there is no guarantee that additional cost will not be incurred beyond the amount accrued if we fail to properly manage the safety of our facility and the environmental risk associated therewith or if we are required to increase our accrual for contingency for environmental claim and proceeding in the future it could potentially have an adverse effect on our result of operation risk related to intellectual property patent protectionour long term success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive product we rely and expect to continue to rely on combination of intellectual property including patent trademark trade dress copyright trade secret and domain name protection law well confidentiality and license agreement to protect our intellectual property and proprietary right if we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third party from launching generic or biosimilar version of our branded product using our proprietary technology or from marketing product that are very similar or identical to our currently pending or future patent application may not result in issued patent or be granted on timely basis similarly any term extension that we seek may not be granted on timely basis if at all in addition our issued patent may not contain claim sufficiently broad to protect against third party with similar technology or product or provide with any competitive advantage including exclusivity in particular product area the scope of our patent claim also may vary between country individual country have distinct patent law we may be subject to challenge by third party regarding our intellectual property including among others claim regarding validity enforceability scope and effective term our ability to enforce our patent also depends on the law of individual country and each country practice with respect to enforcement of intellectual property right and the extent to which certain sovereign may seek to engage in policy or practice that may weaken it intellectual property framework law or regulation that promote or provide broad discretion to issue compulsory license in country that provide some form of regulatory exclusivity mechanism exist permitting some form of challenge to our patent by competitor or generic drug marketer prior to or immediately following the expiration of such regulatory exclusivity and generic company are increasingly employing aggressive strategy such at risk launch that challenge our patent right most of the suit involve claim by generic drug manufacturer that patent covering our product process or dosage form are invalid and or do not cover the product of the generic drug manufacturer independent action have been filed alleging that our assertion of or attempt to enforce patent right with respect to certain product constitute unfair competition and or violation of antitrust law such claim may also be brought counterclaim to action we bring to enforce our patent we are also party to other patent damage suit in various jurisdiction pursuant to which generic drug manufacturer payer government or other party are seeking damage from for alleged delay of generic entry we also are often involved in other proceeding such inter partes review post grant review re examination or opposition proceeding before the patent and trademark office the european patent office or other foreign counterpart relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property right of others also if one of our patent is found to be invalid in such proceeding generic or competitive product could be introduced into the market resulting in the erosion of sale of our existing product for example several of the patent in our pneumococcal vaccine portfolio were challenged in inter partes review and post grant review proceeding in the in october the patent trial and appeal board ptab refused to initiate proceeding to two patent in june the ptab ruled on another patent holding that one claim wa valid and that all other claim were invalid the party challenging that patent ha appealed the decision in november the federal circuit vacated the ptab ruling and requested that the ptab redecide the challenge in march and june an additional patent wa found invalid in separate proceeding by the ptab we have appealed challenge to other patent remain pending in jurisdiction outside the the invalidation of all of these patent in our pneumococcal portfolio could potentially allow competitor pneumococcal vaccine into the marketplace further if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreement or other agreement pursuant to which third party grant right to intellectual property including because such agreement expire or are terminated our operating result and financial condition could be materially adversely affected likewise in the and other country we currently hold issued trademark registration and have trademark application pending any of which may be the subject of governmental or third party objection which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the trademark our product mature our reliance on our trademark and trade dress to differentiate from our competitor increase and result if we are unable to prevent third party from adopting registering or using trademark pfizer inc form of contentsand trade dress that infringe dilute or otherwise violate our trademark right our business could be materially adversely affected we actively seek to protect our proprietary information including our trade secret and proprietary know how by requiring our employee consultant other advisor and other third party to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreement upon the commencement of their employment engagement or other relationship despite these effort and precaution we may be unable to prevent third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secret or our other intellectual property without authorization and legal remedy in some country may not adequately compensate for the damage caused by such unauthorized use further others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical product that circumvent our intellectual property by mean of alternative design or process or otherwise third party intellectual property claimsa properly functioning intellectual property regime is essential to our business model we are committed to respecting the valid intellectual property right of other company but the patent granting process is imperfect accordingly the pursuit of valid business opportunity may require to challenge intellectual property right held by other company that we believe were improperly granted such challenge may include negotiation and litigation which may not always be successful part of our business depends upon successfully identifying generic pharmaceutical product and biosimilar opportunity and launching product to take advantage of those opportunity which may involve litigation associated cost and time delay and may ultimately not be successful these opportunity may arise in situation where patent protection of equivalent branded product ha expired where patent have been declared invalid or where product do not infringe the patent of others and in some circumstance we may take action such litigation asserting that our product do not infringe patent of existing product or that those patent are invalid or unenforceable in order to achieve first to market or early market position for our product third party may claim that our product infringe one or more patent owned or controlled by the third party claim of intellectual property infringement can be costly and time consuming to resolve may delay or prevent product launch and may result in significant damage we are involved in patent related dispute with third party over our attempt to market generic pharmaceutical product and biosimilars once we have final regulatory approval of the related generic pharmaceutical product or biosimilars we may decide to commercially market these product even though associated legal proceeding including any appeal have not been resolved at risk launch if one of our marketed product is found to infringe valid patent right of third party such third party may be awarded significant damage or we may be prevented from further sale of that product such damage may be enhanced much three fold in the event that we or one of our subsidiary like hospira is found to have willfully infringed valid patent right of third party any of these adverse consequence could have material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition risk related to technology information technology and security significant disruption of information technology system or breach of information security could adversely affect our business we rely to large extent upon sophisticated information technology system to operate our business in the ordinary course of business we collect store and transmit large amount of confidential information including but not limited to personal information and intellectual property and we deploy and operate an array of technical and procedural control to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information we also have outsourced significant element of our operation to third party including significant element of our information technology infrastructure and result we are managing many independent vendor relationship with third party who may or could have access to our confidential information the size and complexity of our information technology and information security system and those of our third party vendor with we contract and the large amount of confidential information that is present on them make such system potentially vulnerable to service interruption or to security breach from inadvertent or intentional action by our employee or vendor or from attack by malicious third party such attack are of ever increasing level of sophistication and are made by group and individual with wide range of motif including but not limited to industrial espionage and expertise including organized criminal group hacktivists nation state and others global pharmaceutical company our system are subject to frequent attack due to the nature of some of these attack there is risk that they may remain undetected for period of time while we have invested in the protection of data and information technology our effort may not prevent service interruption or security breach any such interruption or breach of our system could adversely affect our business operation and or result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property and could result in financial legal business and reputational harm to we maintain cyber liability insurance however this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial legal business or reputational loss that may result from an interruption or breach of our system pfizer inc form of contentsrisks related to our strategic transaction strategic acquisitionsthe success of any of our strategic acquisition will depend in large part on our ability to realize anticipated benefit from combining these business with pfizer we for example may fail to achieve cost saving anticipated with certain of these acquisition or such cost saving within the expected time frame similarly the accretive impact anticipated from certain of these acquisition may not be realized or may be delayed integration of these business may result in the loss of key employee the disruption of ongoing business including third party relationship or inconsistency in standard control procedure and policy we also may fail to generate the revenue growth for the acquired business that we expected at the time of entering into the transaction expected revenue from acquired product and product candidate also may be constrained by development outside of our control unsuccessful clinical trial regulatory hurdle and

outlook our business development initiative section in our financial report pending combination of upjohn with mylanpfizer mylan and upjohn may be unable to satisfy the condition or obtain the approval required to complete the combination of upjohn with mylan the combination and regulatory agency may delay or impose condition on approval of the combination which may diminish the anticipated benefit of the combination the consummation of the combination is subject to numerous condition including the receipt by pfizer of an internal revenue service ruling and an opinion of it tax counsel to the effect that among other thing certain transaction related to the combination and certain related transaction will constitute tax free reorganization within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code the approval of the combination by mylan shareholder and other customary condition certain of which are dependent upon the action of third party result of such condition pfizer can not make any assurance that the combination will be consummated on the term or timeline currently contemplated or at all completion of the combination is also conditioned upon the receipt of certain required government consent and approval including certain approval required from regulatory agency while pfizer mylan and upjohn intend to pursue vigorously all required governmental approval the requirement to receive these approval prior to the consummation of the combination could delay the completion of the combination possibly for significant period of time any delay in the completion of the combination could diminish the anticipated benefit of the combination or result in additional transaction cost loss of revenue or other effect associated with uncertainty about the combination including delaying pfizer ability to capitalize on it strategy of becoming more focused innovative company well upjohn ability to optimize the execution of it growth strategy pfizer may be subject to shareholder lawsuit or other action filed in connection with or in opposition to the combination or any related transaction such litigation could have an adverse effect on the business financial condition and result of operation of pfizer and could prevent or delay the consummation of the combination pfizer ha expended and will continue to expend significant management time and resource and ha incurred and will continue to incur significant expense due to legal advisory printing and financial service fee related to the combination including cost required to obtain the required government consent or defend or settle action noted above we expect to incur cost of approximately million in connection with fully separating upjohn inclusive of million incurred in such charge will include cost and expense related to separation of legal entity and anticipated transaction cost many of these expense must be paid regardless of whether the combination is consummated and even if the expected benefit of the combination are not achieved additionally the completion of the combination including for example obtaining regulatory approval will require significant time and attention from pfizer management and may divert attention from the day to day operation of our business even if the combination is completed anticipated pfizer may not realize some or all of the expected benefit furthermore upjohn may experience operational challenge in integrating the upjohn and mylan business which may also diminish the anticipated benefit of the combination even if the combination is completed the anticipated operational financial strategic and other benefit of the combination may not be achieved there are many factor that could impact the anticipated benefit from the combination including among others strategic adjustment required to reflect the nature of our business following the combination any negative reaction to the combination by our customer and business partner and increased risk resulting from pfizer becoming company that is more focused on innovative medicine in addition pfizer ha agreed to provide certain transition service to the combined company generally for an initial period of month following the completion of the combination with certain possibility for extension these obligation under the transition agreement may result in additional expense and may divert pfizer inc form of contentspfizer focus and resource that would otherwise be invested into maintaining or growing pfizer business an inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefit of the combination well any delay encountered in the process could have an adverse effect on the revenue level of expense and operating result of our business furthermore the combination is complex costly and time consuming process even if upjohn and mylan successfully integrate pfizer upjohn and mylan can not predict with certainty if or when the anticipated synergy growth opportunity and benefit resulting from the combination will occur or the extent to which they actually will be achieved for example the benefit from the combination may be offset by cost incurred in integrating the company or by required capital expenditure related to the combined business in addition the quantification of synergy expected to result from the combination is based on significant estimate and assumption that are subjective in nature and inherently uncertain realization of any benefit and synergy could be affected by number of factor beyond pfizer mylan upjohn or the combined company control including without limitation general economic condition increased operating cost regulatory development and the other risk described in these risk factor the amount of synergy actually realized in the combination if any and the time period in which any such synergy are realized could differ materially from the synergy anticipated to be realized regardless of whether the two business operation are combined successfully if the integration is unsuccessful or if the combined company is unable to realize the anticipated synergy and other benefit of the combination there could be material adverse effect on the combined company share price business financial condition and result of operation consumer healthcare joint venture with gskon july we completed the transaction in which

initial public offering should separation and listing occur during the first five year after closing pfizer ha the option to participate through the distribution of some or all of it equity interest in the joint venture to it shareholder following separation or listing and subject to customary lock up or similar restriction pfizer will also have the ability to sell it equity interest in the joint venture through the capital market after the fifth anniversary of the closing of the transaction both gsk and pfizer will have the right to decide whether and when to initiate separation and public listing of the joint venture the planned separation and public listing transaction may not be initiated or completed within the expected time period or at all and both the timing and success of any separation and public listing transaction well the value generated for pfizer or it shareholder in any such transaction will be subject to prevailing market condition and other factor at the time of such transaction although pfizer is entitled to participate in any separation and listing transaction initiated by gsk prior to the fifth anniversary of the closing it is not required to do so and any future distribution or sale of pfizer equity stake in the joint venture will similarly be subject to prevailing market condition and other factor at the time of such transaction pfizer ability to complete any such future distribution or sale may also be impacted by the size of pfizer retained equity stake at the time the uncertainty relating to the separation and public listing transaction their implementation their timing and their yet to be determined effect on the joint venture business may subject and the joint venture to risk and uncertainty that may adversely affect our business and financial result moreover although we have certain consent board representation and other governance right with respect to the joint venture pfizer is minority owner of the joint venture result pfizer doe not have control over the joint venture it management or it policy and we may have business interest strategy and goal that differ in certain respect from those of gsk or the joint venture in addition the joint venture will be subject to the risk associated with the joint venture consumer healthcare business and the business financial condition and result of operation of the joint venture may be affected by factor that are different from or in addition to those that previously affected the business financial condition and result of operation of pfizer historical consumer healthcare business many of these factor are outside of our and the joint venture control and could materially impact the business financial condition and result of operation of the joint venture the success of the transaction will also depend in part on the joint venture ability to realize the anticipated benefit and cost synergy from the transaction these anticipated benefit and cost saving may not be realized or may not be realized within the expected time period the joint venture integration of pfizer and gsk historic consumer healthcare business may result in material unanticipated problem cost expense liability competitive response and loss of customer and other business relationship any material unanticipated issue arising from the integration process could negatively impact
