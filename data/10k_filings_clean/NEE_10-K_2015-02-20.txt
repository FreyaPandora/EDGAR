under the law of florida in and is wholly owned subsidiary of nee fpl is rate regulated electric utility and is the largest electric utility in the state of florida and one of the largest electric utility in the based on retail mwh sale fpl with mw of generating capacity at december supply electric service throughout of the east and lower west coast of florida serving more than million people through approximately million customer account at december fpl service territory and plant location are follows see item property generating facility franchise agreement and competitionfpl service to it retail customer is provided primarily under franchise agreement negotiated with municipality or county alternatively municipality and county may form their own utility company to provide service to their resident in case an fpl franchise agreement provides the respective municipality the right to buy the electrical asset serving local resident at the end of the agreement however during the term of franchise agreement which is typically year the municipality or county agrees not to form it own utility and fpl ha the right to offer electric service to resident fpl currently hold franchise agreement with various municipality and county in florida with varying expiration date through one of franchise agreement expires in three expire in and expire during the period through these franchise agreement cover approximately of fpl retail customer base in florida negotiation are ongoing to renew the franchise agreement that expire in and fpl considers it franchise to be adequate for the conduct of it business fpl also provides service to other municipality and to unincorporated area within it service area without franchise agreement pursuant to the general obligation to serve public utility fpl relies upon florida law for access to public right of way any customer may elect to provide own electric service fpl effectively must compete for an individual customer business practical matter few customer provide their own service at the present time since fpl cost of service is substantially lower than the cost of self generation for the vast majority of customer changing technology economic condition and other factor could alter the favorable relative cost position that fpl currently enjoys however fpl seek matter of strategy to ensure that it delivers superior value in the form of high reliability low bill and excellent customer service in addition to self generation by residential commercial and industrial customer fpl also face competition from other supplier of electrical energy to wholesale customer and from alternative energy source in each of and operating revenue from wholesale and industrial customer combined represented approximately and respectively of fpl total operating revenue of contentsthe fpsc promotes cost competitiveness in the building of new steam and solar generating capacity of mw or greater by requiring investor owned electric utility including fpl to issue an rfp except the fpsc determines that an exception from the rfp process is in the public interest the rfp process allows independent power producer and others to bid to supply the new generating capacity if bidder ha the most cost effective alternative meet other criterion such financial viability and demonstrates adequate expertise and experience in building and or operating generating capacity of the type proposed the investor owned electric utility would seek to negotiate purchased power agreement with the selected bidder and request that the fpsc approve the term of the purchased power agreement and if appropriate provide the required authorization for the construction of the bidder generating capacity in january fpl announced plan to issue an rfp during the first quarter of for new natural gas fired combined cycle unit in okeechobee county florida new nuclear power plant are exempt from the rfp requirement see fpl source of generation nuclear operation below customer and revenuefpl primary source of operating revenue is from it retail customer base it also serf limited number of wholesale customer within florida fpl revenue from wholesale sale increased in primarily due to an increase in contracted load served under existing and new wholesale contract beginning in operating revenue include gain associated with an incentive mechanism allowed under the rate agreement see fpl regulation fpl rate regulation base rate rate effective january december such gain are included in other in the chart below the percentage of fpl operating revenue and customer account by customer class were follows for both retail and wholesale customer the price or rate that fpl may charge are approved by regulatory body by the fpsc in the case of retail customer and by the ferc in the case of wholesale customer in general under and florida law regulated rate are intended to cover the cost of providing service including reasonable rate of return on invested capital since the regulatory body have authority to determine the relevant cost of providing service and the appropriate rate of return on capital employed there can be no guarantee that fpl will be able to earn any particular rate of return or recover all of it cost through regulated rate see fpl regulation below of contentsfpl seek to maintain attractive rate for it customer since rate are largely cost based maintaining low rate requires strategy focused on developing and maintaining low cost position the idea generated from the cost saving initiative discussed are expected to keep fpl expense recovered through base rate flat through compared to common benchmark used in the electric power industry for comparing rate across company is the price of kwh of consumption per month for residential customer fpl average bill for kwh of monthly residential usage wa the lowest among reporting electric utility within florida indicated below power deliveryfpl provides service to it customer through an integrated transmission and distribution system that link it generation facility to it customer fpl also maintains interconnection facility with neighboring utility and non utility generator inside it service territory enabling it to buy and sell wholesale electricity and to enhance the reliability of it own network and support the reliability of neighboring network fpl transmission system carry high voltage electricity from it generating facility to substation the electricity is stepped to lower voltage level and is sent through the distribution system to it customer key element of fpl strategy is to provide highly reliable service to it customer the transmission and distribution system is susceptible to interruption or outage from wide variety of source including weather animal and vegetation interference traffic accident equipment failure and many others and fpl seek to reduce or eliminate outage where economically practical and to restore service rapidly when outage occur common industry benchmark for transmission and distribution system reliability is the system average interruption duration index saidi which represents the number of minute the average customer is without power during time period for the five year fpl average annual saidi wa the best of the investor owned utility in florida fpl is accelerating it existing storm hardening and reliability program to continue strengthening it infrastructure tropical storm and hurricane also part of it commitment to building smarter more reliable and efficient electric infrastructure fpl ha installed million smart meter and intelligent device throughout the electric grid fpl system capability and loadat december fpl resource for serving load consisted of mw of which mw were from fpl owned facility see item property generating facility and mw were available through purchased power agreement see fpl source of generation purchased power below fpl customer usage and operating revenue are typically higher during the summer month largely due to the prevalent use of air conditioning in fpl service territory occasionally unusually cold temperature during the winter month result in significant increase in electricity usage for short period of time the highest peak load fpl ha served to date wa mw which occurred on january fpl adequate resource available at the time of this peak to meet customer demand fpl projected reserve margin for the summer of is approximately this reserve margin is expected to be achieved through the combination of available output from fpl active generating unit purchased power agreement and the capability to reduce peak demand through the implementation of demand side management program including load management which wa estimated at december to be capable of reducing demand by approximately mw and energy efficiency and conservation program see fpl source of generation fossil operation and nuclear operation below regarding generation project currently under construction of contentsfpl source of generationfpl relies upon mix of fuel source for it generating facility along with purchased power in order to maintain the flexibility to achieve more economical fuel mix by responding to market and industry development see description of fossil nuclear and solar operation

presented by competition neer may also face specific constraint in the form of price cap or maximum allowed price for certain product neer ability to sell the output of it generation facility may also be constrained by available transmission capacity which can vary from time to time and can have significant impact on pricing the degree and nature of competition that neer face is different in wholesale market and in retail market approximately of neer revenue is derived from wholesale market wholesale power generation is capital intensive commodity driven business with numerous industry participant neer primarily competes on the basis of price but belief the green attribute of neer generating asset it creditworthiness and it ability to offer and manage reliable customized risk solution to wholesale customer are competitive advantage wholesale power generation is regional business that is highly fragmented relative to many other commodity industry and diverse in term of

to nee and fpl businessthe business financial condition result of operation and prospect of nee and fpl are subject to variety of risk many of which are beyond the control of nee and fpl the following is description of important risk that may materially adversely affect the business financial condition result of operation and prospect of nee and fpl and may cause actual result of nee and fpl to differ substantially from those that nee or fpl currently expects or seek in that event the market price for the security of nee or fpl could decline accordingly the risk described below should be carefully considered together with the other information set forth in this report and in future report that nee and fpl file with the sec the risk described below are not the only risk facing nee and fpl additional risk and uncertainty may also materially adversely affect nee or fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect each of nee and fpl ha disclosed the material risk known to it to affect it business at this time however there may be further risk and uncertainty that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be material that may in the future materially adversely affect the business financial condition result of operation or prospect of nee and fpl regulatory legislative and legal risksnee and fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect may be materially adversely affected by the extensive regulation of their business the operation of nee and fpl are subject to complex and comprehensive federal state and other regulation this extensive regulatory framework portion of which are more specifically identified in the following risk factor regulates among other thing and to varying degree nee and fpl industry

authority to disallow recovery by fpl of cost that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred and to determine the level of return that fpl is permitted to earn on invested capital the regulatory process which may be adversely affected by the political regulatory and economic environment in florida and elsewhere limit fpl ability to increase earnings and doe not provide any assurance to achievement of authorized or other earnings level nee and fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect could be materially adversely affected if any material amount of cost return on certain asset or reasonable return on invested capital can not be recovered through base rate cost recovery clause other regulatory mechanism or otherwise certain subsidiary of neet which are indirect wholly owned subsidiary of nee are regulated electric transmission utility subject to the jurisdiction of their regulator and subject to similar risk regulatory decision that are important to nee and fpl may be materially adversely affected by political regulatory and economic factor the local and national political regulatory and economic environment ha had and may in the future have an adverse effect on fpsc decision with negative consequence for fpl these decision may require for example fpl to cancel or delay planned development activity to reduce or delay other planned capital expenditure or to pay for investment or otherwise incur cost that it may not be able to recover through rate each of which could have material adverse effect on the business financial condition result of operation and prospect of nee and fpl certain subsidiary of neet are subject to similar risk fpl use of derivative instrument could be subject to prudence challenge and if found imprudent could result in disallowances of cost recovery for such use by the fpsc the fpsc engages in an annual prudence review of fpl use of derivative instrument in it risk management fuel procurement program and should it find any such use to be imprudent the fpsc could deny cost recovery for such use by fpl such an outcome could have material adverse effect on fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect of contentsany reduction to or the elimination of governmental incentive that support utility scale renewable energy including but not limited to tax incentive rps or feed in tariff or the imposition of additional tax or other assessment on renewable energy could result in among other item the lack of satisfactory market for the development of new renewable energy project neer abandoning the development of renewable energy project loss of neer investment in renewable energy project and reduced project return any of which could have material adverse effect on nee business financial condition result of operation and prospect neer depends heavily on government policy that support utility scale renewable energy and enhance the economic feasibility of developing and operating wind and solar energy project in region in which neer operates or plan to develop and operate renewable energy facility the federal government majority of the state and portion of canada and spain provide incentive such tax incentive rps or feed in tariff that support the sale of energy from utility scale renewable energy facility such wind and solar energy facility result of budgetary constraint political factor or otherwise government from time to time may review their policy that support renewable energy and consider action that would make the policy le conducive to the development and operation of renewable energy facility any reduction to or the elimination of governmental incentive that support renewable energy such those reduction that have been enacted in spain and are applicable to neer solar generating facility in that country or the imposition of additional tax or other assessment on renewable energy could result in among other item the lack of satisfactory market for the development of new renewable energy project neer abandoning the development of renewable energy project loss of neer investment in the project and reduced project return any of which could have material adverse effect on nee business financial condition result of operation and prospect nee and fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect could be materially adversely affected result of new or revised law regulation or interpretation or other regulatory initiative nee and fpl business is influenced by various legislative and regulatory initiative including but not limited to new or revised law regulation or interpretation or other regulatory initiative regarding deregulation or restructuring of the energy industry regulation of the commodity trading and derivative market and environmental regulation such regulation of air emission regulation of water consumption and water discharge and regulation of gas and oil infrastructure operation well associated environmental permitting change in the nature of the regulation of nee and fpl business could have material adverse effect on nee and fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect nee and fpl are unable to predict future legislative or regulatory change initiative or interpretation although any such change initiative or interpretation may increase cost and competitive pressure on nee and fpl which could have material adverse effect on nee and fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect fpl ha limited competition in the florida market for retail electricity customer any change in florida law or regulation which introduce competition in the florida retail electricity market such government incentive that facilitate the installation of solar generating facility on residential or other rooftop at below cost or would permit third party sale of electricity could have material adverse effect on fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect there can be no assurance that fpl will be able to respond adequately to such regulatory change which could have material adverse effect on fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect neer is subject to ferc rule related to transmission that are designed to facilitate competition in the wholesale market on practically nationwide basis by providing greater certainty flexibility and more choice to wholesale power customer nee can not predict the impact of changing ferc rule or the effect of change in level of wholesale supply and demand which are typically driven by factor beyond nee control there can be no assurance that neer will be able to respond adequately or sufficiently quickly to such rule and development or to any other change that reverse or restrict the competitive restructuring of the energy industry in those jurisdiction in which such restructuring ha occurred any of these event could have material adverse effect on nee business financial condition result of operation and prospect nee and fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect could be materially adversely affected if the rule implementing the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act broaden the scope of it provision regarding the regulation of otc financial derivative and make certain provision applicable to nee and fpl the dodd frank act enacted into law in july provides for among other thing substantially increased regulation of the otc derivative market and future contract market while the legislation is broad and detailed there are still portion of the legislation that either require implementing rule to be adopted by federal governmental agency or otherwise require further interpretive guidance nee and fpl continue to monitor the development of rule related to the dodd frank act and have taken step to comply with those rule that affect their business while number of rule have been finalized and are effective the rule related to margin requirement for otc derivative have yet to be finalized if those rule when finalized require nee and fpl to post significant amount of cash collateral with respect to swap transaction nee and fpl liquidity could be materially adversely affected of contentsnee and fpl can not predict the impact these proposed rule will have on their ability to hedge their commodity and interest rate risk or on otc derivative market whole but they could potentially have material adverse effect on nee and fpl risk exposure well reduce market liquidity and further increase the cost of hedging activity nee and fpl are subject to numerous environmental law regulation and other standard that may result in capital expenditure increased operating cost and various liability and may require nee and fpl to limit or eliminate certain operation nee and fpl are subject to domestic and foreign environmental law and regulation including but not limited to extensive federal state and local environmental statute rule and regulation relating to air quality water quality and usage climate change emission of greenhouse gas including but not limited to waste management hazardous waste marine avian and other wildlife mortality and habitat protection historical artifact preservation natural resource health including but not limited to electric and magnetic field from power line and substation safety and rps that could among other thing prevent or delay the development of power generation power or natural gas transmission or other infrastructure project restrict the output of some existing facility limit the availability and use of some fuel required for the production of electricity require additional pollution control equipment and otherwise increase cost increase capital expenditure and limit or eliminate certain operation there are significant capital operating and other cost associated with compliance with these environmental statute rule and regulation and those cost could be even more significant in the future result of new legislation the current trend toward more stringent standard and stricter and more expansive application of existing environmental regulation for example among other potential or pending change the use of hydraulic fracturing or similar technology to drill for natural gas and related compound used by nee gas infrastructure business is currently being discussed for regulation at state and federal level violation of current or future law rule regulation or other standard could expose nee and fpl to regulatory and legal proceeding dispute with and legal challenge by third party and potentially significant civil fine criminal penalty and other sanction proceeding could include for example litigation regarding property damage personal injury common law nuisance and enforcement by citizen or governmental authority of environmental requirement such air water and soil quality standard nee and fpl business could be negatively affected by federal or state law or regulation mandating new or additional limit on the production of greenhouse gas emission federal or state law or regulation may be adopted that would impose new or additional limit on the emission of greenhouse gas including but not limited to and methane from electric generating unit using fossil fuel like coal and natural gas the potential effect of such greenhouse gas emission limit on nee and fpl electric generating unit are subject to significant uncertainty based on among other thing the timing of the implementation of any new requirement the required level of emission reduction the nature of any market based or tax based mechanism adopted to facilitate reduction the relative availability of greenhouse gas emission reduction offset the development of cost effective commercial scale carbon capture and storage technology and supporting regulation and liability mitigation measure and the range of available compliance alternative while nee and fpl electric generating unit emit greenhouse gas at lower rate of emission than most of the electric generation sector the result of operation of nee and fpl could be materially adversely affected to the extent that new federal or state law or regulation impose any new greenhouse gas emission limit any future limit on greenhouse gas emission could create substantial additional cost in the form of tax or emission allowance make some of nee and fpl electric generating unit uneconomical to operate in the long term require significant capital investment in carbon capture and storage technology fuel switching or the replacement of high emitting generation facility with lower emitting generation facility or affect the availability or cost of fossil fuel there can be no assurance that nee or fpl would be able to completely recover any such cost or investment which could have material adverse effect on their business financial condition result of operation and prospect extensive federal regulation of the operation of nee and fpl expose nee and fpl to significant and increasing compliance cost and may also expose them to substantial monetary penalty and other sanction for compliance failure nee and fpl are subject to extensive federal regulation which generally imposes significant and increasing compliance cost on nee and fpl operation additionally any actual or alleged compliance failure could result in significant cost and other potentially adverse effect of regulatory investigation proceeding settlement decision and claim including among other item potentially significant monetary penalty an example under the energy policy act of nee and fpl owner and operator of bulk power transmission system and or electric generation facility are subject to mandatory reliability standard compliance with these mandatory reliability standard may subject nee and fpl to higher operating cost and may result in increased capital expenditure if fpl or nee is found not to be in compliance with these standard it may incur substantial monetary penalty and other sanction both the cost of regulatory compliance and the cost that may be imposed result of any actual or alleged compliance failure could have material adverse effect on nee and fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect of contentschanges in tax law well judgment and estimate used in the determination of tax related asset and liability amount could materially adversely affect nee and fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect nee and fpl provision for income tax and reporting of tax related asset and liability require significant judgment and the use of estimate amount of tax related asset and liability involve judgment and estimate of the timing and probability of recognition of income deduction and tax credit including but not limited to estimate for potential adverse outcome regarding tax position that have been taken and the ability to utilize tax benefit carryforwards such net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards actual income tax could vary significantly from estimated amount due to the future impact of among other thing change in tax law regulation and interpretation the financial condition and result of operation of nee and fpl and the resolution of audit issue raised by taxing authority ultimate resolution of income tax matter may result in material adjustment to tax related asset and liability which could materially adversely affect nee and fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect nee and fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect may be materially adversely affected due to adverse result of litigation nee and fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect may be materially affected by adverse result of litigation unfavorable resolution of legal proceeding in which nee is involved or other future legal proceeding including but not limited to class action lawsuit may have material adverse effect on the business financial condition result of operation and prospect of nee and fpl operational risksnee and fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect could suffer if nee and fpl do not proceed with project under development or are unable to complete the construction of or capital improvement to electric generation transmission and distribution facility gas infrastructure facility or other facility on schedule or within budget nee and fpl ability to complete construction of and capital improvement project for their electric generation transmission and distribution facility gas infrastructure facility and other facility on schedule and within budget may be adversely affected by escalating cost for material and labor and regulatory compliance inability to obtain or renew necessary license right of way permit or other approval on acceptable term or on schedule dispute involving contractor labor organization land owner governmental entity environmental group native american and aboriginal group and other third party negative publicity transmission interconnection issue and other factor if any development project or construction or capital improvement project is not completed is delayed or is subject to cost overrun certain associated cost may not be approved for recovery or recoverable through regulatory mechanism that may otherwise be available and nee and fpl could become obligated to make delay or termination payment or become obligated for other damage under contract could experience the loss of tax credit or tax incentive or delayed or diminished return and could be required to write all or portion of their investment in the project any of these event could have material adverse effect on nee and fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect nee and fpl may face risk related to project siting financing construction permitting governmental approval and the negotiation of project development agreement that may impede their development and operating activity nee and fpl own develop construct manage and operate electric generating and transmission facility key component of nee and fpl growth is their ability to construct and operate generation and transmission facility to meet customer need part of these operation nee and fpl must periodically apply for license and permit from various local state federal and other regulatory authority and abide by their respective condition should nee or fpl be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary license or permit on acceptable term should there be delay in obtaining or renewing necessary license or permit or should regulatory authority initiate any associated investigation or enforcement action or impose related penalty or disallowances on nee or fpl nee and fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect could be materially adversely affected any failure to negotiate successful project development agreement for new facility with third party could have similar result the operation and maintenance of nee and fpl electric generation transmission and distribution facility gas infrastructure facility and other facility are subject to many operational risk the consequence of which could have material adverse effect on nee and fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect nee and fpl electric generation transmission and distribution facility gas infrastructure facility and other facility are subject to many operational risk operational risk could result in among other thing lost revenue due to prolonged outage increased expense due to monetary penalty or fine for compliance failure liability to third party for property and personal injury damage failure to perform under applicable power sale agreement and associated loss of revenue from terminated agreement or liability for liquidated damage under continuing agreement and replacement equipment cost or an obligation to purchase or generate replacement power at higher price of contentsuncertainties and risk inherent in operating and maintaining nee and fpl facility include but are not limited to risk associated with facility start up operation such whether the facility will achieve projected operating performance on schedule and otherwise planned failure in the availability acquisition or transportation of fuel or other necessary supply the impact of unusual or adverse weather condition and natural disaster including but not limited to hurricane flood earthquake and drought performance below expected or contracted level of output or efficiency breakdown or failure including but not limited to explosion fire or other major event of equipment transmission and distribution line or pipeline availability of replacement equipment risk of property damage or human injury from energized equipment hazardous substance or explosion fire or other event availability of adequate water resource and ability to satisfy water intake and discharge requirement inability to identify manage properly or mitigate equipment defect in nee and fpl facility use of new or unproven technology risk associated with dependence on specific type of fuel or fuel source such commodity price risk availability of adequate fuel supply and transportation and lack of available alternative fuel source increased competition due to among other factor new facility excess supply and shifting demand and insufficient insurance warranty or performance guarantee to cover any or all lost revenue or increased expense from the foregoing nee and fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect may be negatively affected by lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customer or in customer usage growth in customer account and growth of customer usage each directly influence the demand for electricity and the need for additional power generation and power delivery facility customer growth and customer usage are affected by number of factor outside the control of nee and fpl such mandated energy efficiency measure demand side management requirement and economic and demographic condition such population change job and income growth housing start new business formation and the overall level of economic activity lack of growth or decline in the number of customer or in customer demand for electricity may cause nee and fpl to fail to fully realize the anticipated benefit from significant investment and expenditure and could have material adverse effect on nee and fpl growth business financial condition result of operation and prospect nee and fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect can be materially adversely affected by weather condition including but not limited to the impact of severe weather weather condition directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and other fuel and affect the price of energy and energy related commodity in addition severe weather and natural disaster such hurricane flood and earthquake can be destructive and cause power outage and property damage reduce revenue affect the availability of fuel and water and require nee and fpl to incur additional cost for example to restore service and repair damaged facility to obtain replacement power and to access available financing source furthermore nee and fpl physical plant could be placed at greater risk of damage should change in the global climate produce unusual variation in temperature and weather pattern resulting in more intense frequent and extreme weather event abnormal level of precipitation and particularly relevant to fpl change in sea level fpl operates in the east and lower west coast of florida an area that historically ha been prone to severe weather event such hurricane disruption or failure of electric generation transmission or distribution system or natural gas production transmission storage or distribution system in the event of hurricane tornado or other severe weather event or otherwise could prevent nee and fpl from operating their business in the normal course and could result in any of the adverse consequence described above any of the foregoing could have material adverse effect on nee and fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect at fpl and other business of nee where cost recovery is available recovery of cost to restore service and repair damaged facility is or may be subject to regulatory approval and any determination by the regulator not to permit timely and full recovery of the cost incurred could have material adverse effect on nee and fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect change in weather can also affect the production of electricity at power generating facility including but not limited to neer wind and solar facility for example the level of wind resource affect the revenue produced by wind generating facility because the level of wind and solar resource are variable and difficult to predict neer result of operation for individual wind and solar facility specifically and nee result of operation generally may vary significantly from period to period depending on the level of available resource to the extent that resource are not available at planned level the financial result from these facility may be le than expected of contentsthreats of terrorism and catastrophic event that could result from terrorism cyber attack or individual and or group attempting to disrupt nee and fpl business or the business of third party may materially adversely affect nee and fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect nee and fpl are subject to the potentially adverse operating and financial effect of terrorist act and threat well cyber attack and other disruptive activity of individual or group there have been cyber attack on energy infrastructure such substation gas pipeline and related asset in the past and there may be such attack in the future nee and fpl generation transmission and distribution facility fuel storage facility information technology system and other infrastructure facility and system could be direct target of or be indirectly affected by such activity terrorist act cyber attack or other similar event affecting nee and fpl system and facility or those of third party on which nee and fpl rely could harm nee and fpl business for example by limiting their ability to generate purchase or transmit power by limiting their ability to bill customer and collect and process payment and by delaying their development and construction of new generating facility or capital improvement to existing facility these event and governmental action in response could result in material decrease in revenue significant additional cost for example to repair asset implement additional security requirement or maintain or acquire insurance and reputational damage could materially adversely affect nee and fpl operation for example by contributing to disruption of supply and market for natural gas oil and other fuel and could impair nee and fpl ability to raise capital for example by contributing to financial instability and lower economic activity in addition the implementation of security guideline and measure ha resulted in and is expected to continue to result in increased cost such event or action may materially adversely affect nee and fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect the ability of nee and fpl to obtain insurance and the term of any available insurance coverage could be materially adversely affected by international national state or local event and company specific event well the financial condition of insurer nee and fpl insurance coverage doe not provide protection against all significant loss insurance coverage may not continue to be available or may not be available at rate or on term similar to those presently available to nee and fpl the ability of nee and fpl to obtain insurance and the term of any available insurance coverage could be materially adversely affected by international national state or local event and company specific event well the financial condition of insurer if insurance coverage is not available or obtainable on acceptable term nee or fpl may be required to pay cost associated with adverse future event nee and fpl generally are not fully insured against all significant loss for example fpl is not fully insured against hurricane related loss but would instead seek recovery of such uninsured loss from customer subject to approval by the fpsc to the extent loss exceed restricted fund set aside to cover the cost of storm damage loss for which nee or fpl is not fully insured could have material adverse effect on nee and fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect nee invests in gas and oil producing asset through neer gas infrastructure business the gas infrastructure business is exposed to fluctuating market price of natural gas natural gas liquid oil and other energy commodity prolonged period of low gas and oil price could impact neer gas infrastructure business and cause neer to delay or cancel certain gas infrastructure project and for certain existing project to be impaired which could materially adversely affect nee result of operation natural gas and oil price are affected by supply and demand both globally and regionally factor that influence supply and demand include operational issue natural disaster weather political instability conflict economic condition and action by major oil producing country there can be significant volatility in market price for gas and oil and price fluctuation could have material effect on the financial performance of gas and oil producing asset for example in low gas and oil price environment neer would generate le revenue from it gas infrastructure investment in gas and oil producing property and result certain investment might become le profitable or incur loss prolonged period of low oil and gas price could also result in oil and gas production project being delayed or cancelled and for certain existing project to be impaired which could materially adversely affect nee result of operation if supply cost necessary to provide neer full energy and capacity requirement service are not favorable operating cost could increase and materially adversely affect nee business financial condition result of operation and prospect neer provides full energy and capacity requirement service primarily to distribution utility which include load following service and various ancillary service to satisfy all or portion of such utility power supply obligation to their customer the supply cost for these transaction may be affected by number of factor including but not limited to event that may occur after such utility have committed to supply power such weather condition fluctuating price for energy and ancillary service and the ability of the distribution utility customer to elect to receive service from competing supplier neer may not be able to recover all of it increased supply cost which could have material adverse effect on nee business financial condition result of operation and prospect due to the potential for significant volatility in market price for fuel electricity and renewable and other energy commodity neer inability or failure to manage properly or hedge effectively the commodity risk within it portfolio of contentscould materially adversely affect nee business financial condition result of operation and prospect there can be significant volatility in market price for fuel electricity and renewable and other energy commodity nee inability or failure to manage properly or hedge effectively it asset or position against change in commodity price volume interest rate counterparty credit risk or other risk measure based on factor both from within or wholly or partially outside of nee control may materially adversely affect nee business financial condition result of operation and prospect sale of power on the spot market or on short term contractual basis may cause nee result of operation to be volatile portion of neer power generation facility operate wholly or partially without long term power purchase agreement power from these facility is sold on the spot market or on short term contractual basis spot market sale are subject to market volatility and the revenue generated from these sale is subject to fluctuation that may cause nee result of operation to be volatile neer and nee may not be able to manage volatility adequately which could have material adverse effect on nee business financial condition result of operation and prospect reduction in the liquidity of energy market may restrict the ability of nee to manage it operational risk which in turn could negatively affect nee result of operation nee is an active participant in energy market the liquidity of regional energy market is an important factor in nee ability to manage risk in these operation over the past several year other market participant have ceased or significantly reduced their activity in energy market result of several factor including but not limited to government investigation change in market design and deteriorating credit quality liquidity in the energy market can be adversely affected by price volatility restriction on the availability of credit and other factor and any reduction in the liquidity of energy market could have material adverse effect on nee business financial condition result of operation and prospect nee and fpl hedging and trading procedure and associated risk management tool may not protect against significant loss nee and fpl have hedging and trading procedure and associated risk management tool such separate but complementary financial credit operational compliance and legal reporting system internal control management review process and other mechanism nee and fpl are unable to assure that such procedure and tool will be effective against all potential risk including without limitation employee misconduct if such procedure and tool are not effective this could have material adverse effect on nee business financial condition result of operation and prospect if price movement significantly or persistently deviate from historical behavior nee and fpl risk management tool associated with their hedging and trading procedure may not protect against significant loss nee and fpl risk management tool and metric associated with their hedging and trading procedure such daily value at risk earnings at risk stop loss limit and liquidity guideline are based on historical price movement due to the inherent uncertainty involved in price movement and potential deviation from historical pricing behavior nee and fpl are unable to assure that their risk management tool and metric will be effective to protect against material adverse effect on their business financial condition result of operation and prospect if power transmission or natural gas nuclear fuel or other commodity transportation facility are unavailable or disrupted fpl and neer ability to sell and deliver power or natural gas may be limited fpl and neer depend upon power transmission and natural gas nuclear fuel and other commodity transportation facility many of which they do not own occurrence affecting the operation of these facility that may or may not be beyond fpl and neer control such severe weather or generation or transmission facility outage pipeline rupture or sudden and significant increase or decrease in wind generation may limit or halt the ability of fpl and neer to sell and deliver power and natural gas or to purchase necessary fuel and other commodity which could materially adversely impact nee and fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect nee and fpl are subject to credit and performance risk from customer hedging counterparties and vendor nee and fpl are exposed to risk associated with the creditworthiness and performance of their customer hedging counterparties and vendor under contract for the supply of equipment material fuel and other good and service required for their business operation and for the construction and operation of and for capital improvement to their facility adverse condition in the energy industry or the general economy well circumstance of individual customer hedging counterparties and vendor may affect the ability of some customer hedging counterparties and vendor to perform required under their contract with nee and fpl if any hedging vending or other counterparty fails to fulfill it contractual obligation nee and fpl may need to make arrangement with other counterparties or vendor which could result in financial loss higher cost untimely completion of power generation of contentsfacilities and other project and or disruption of their operation if defaulting counterparty is in poor financial condition nee and fpl may not be able to recover damage for any contract breach nee and fpl could recognize financial loss or reduction in operating cash flow if counterparty fails to perform or make payment in accordance with the term of derivative contract or if nee or fpl is required to post margin cash collateral under derivative contract nee and fpl use derivative instrument such swap option future and forward some of which are traded in the otc market or on exchange to manage their commodity and financial market risk and for nee to engage in trading and marketing activity any failure by their counterparties to perform or make payment in accordance with the term of those transaction could have material adverse effect on nee or fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect similarly any requirement for fpl or nee to post margin cash collateral under it derivative contract could have material adverse effect on it business financial condition result of operation and prospect nee and fpl are highly dependent on sensitive and complex information technology system and any failure or breach of those system could have material adverse effect on their business financial condition result of operation and prospect nee and fpl operate in highly regulated industry that requires the continuous functioning of sophisticated information technology system and network infrastructure despite nee and fpl implementation of security measure all of their technology system are vulnerable to disability failure or unauthorized access due to such activity if nee or fpl information technology system were to fail or be breached sensitive confidential and other data could be compromised and nee and fpl could be unable to fulfill critical business function nee and fpl business is highly dependent on their ability to process and monitor on daily basis very large number of transaction many of which are highly complex and cross numerous and diverse market due to the size scope and geographical reach of nee and fpl business and due to the complexity of the process of power generation transmission and distribution the development and maintenance of information technology system to keep track of and process information is critical and challenging nee and fpl operating system and facility may fail to operate properly or become disabled result of event that are either within or wholly or partially outside of their control such operator error severe weather or terrorist activity any such failure or disabling event could materially adversely affect nee and fpl ability to process transaction and provide service and their business financial condition result of operation and prospect nee and fpl add modify and replace information system on regular basis modifying existing information system or implementing new or replacement information system is costly and involves risk including but not limited to integrating the modified new or replacement system with existing system and process implementing associated change in accounting procedure and control and ensuring that data conversion is accurate and consistent any disruption or deficiency in existing information system or disruption delay or deficiency in the modification or implementation of new information system could result in increased cost the inability to track or collect revenue

contract with customer and required disclosure see note revenue and rate critical accounting policy and estimatesnee and fpl significant accounting policy are described in note to the consolidated financial statement which were prepared under gaap critical accounting policy are those that nee and fpl believe are both most important to the portrayal of their financial condition and result of operation and require complex subjective judgment often result of the need to make estimate and assumption about the effect of matter that are inherently uncertain judgment and uncertainty affecting the application of those policy may result in materially different amount being reported under different condition or using different assumption nee and fpl consider the following policy to be the most critical in understanding the judgment that are involved in preparing their consolidated financial statement accounting for derivative and hedging activitiesnee and fpl use derivative instrument primarily swap option future and forward to manage the commodity price risk inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity well interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with outstanding and forecasted debt issuance in addition nee through neer us derivative to optimize the value of power generation and gas infrastructure asset and engages in power and gas marketing and trading activity to take advantage of expected future favorable price movement of contentsnature of accounting estimatesaccounting pronouncement require the use of fair value accounting if certain condition are met which requires significant judgment to measure the fair value of asset and liability this applies not only to traditional financial derivative instrument but to any contract having the accounting characteristic of derivative much of the existing accounting guidance related to derivative focus on when certain contract for the purchase and sale of power and certain fuel supply contract can be excluded from derivative accounting rule however the guidance doe not address all contract issue result significant judgment must be used in applying derivative accounting guidance to contract in the event change in interpretation occur it is possible that contract that currently are excluded from derivative accounting rule would have to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with change in the fair value recorded in the statement of income assumption and accounting approachnee and fpl derivative instrument when required to be marked to market are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value fair value for some of the longer term contract where liquid market are not available are derived through internally developed model which estimate the fair value of contract by calculating the present value of the difference between the contract price and the forward price forward price represent the price at which buyer or seller could contract today to purchase or sell commodity at future date the near term forward market for electricity is generally liquid and therefore the price in the early year of the forward curve reflect observable market quote however in the later year the market is much le liquid and forward price curve must be developed using factor including the forward price for the commodity used fuel to generate electricity the expected system heat rate which measure the efficiency of power plant in converting fuel to electricity in the region where the purchase or sale take place and fundamental forecast of expected spot price based on modeled supply and demand in the region nee estimate the fair value of interest rate and foreign currency derivative using discounted cash flow valuation technique based on the net amount of estimated future cash inflow and outflow related to the derivative agreement the assumption in these model are critical since any change therein could have significant impact on the fair value of the derivative at fpl substantially all change in the fair value of energy derivative transaction are deferred regulatory asset or liability until the contract are settled and upon settlement any gain or loss are passed through the fuel clause see note in nee non rate regulated operation predominantly neer essentially all change in the derivative fair value for power purchase and sale fuel sale and trading activity are recognized on net basis in operating revenue fuel purchase used in the production of electricity are recognized in fuel purchased power and interchange expense and the equity method investees related activity is recognized in equity in earnings of equity method investees in nee consolidated statement of income for those transaction accounted for cash flow hedge much of the effect of change in fair value are reflected in oci component of common shareholder equity rather than being recognized in current earnings for those transaction accounted for fair value hedge the effect of change in fair value are reflected in current earnings offset by change in the fair value of the item being hedged certain hedging transaction at neer are entered into economic hedge but the transaction do not meet the requirement for hedge accounting hedge accounting treatment is not elected or hedge accounting ha been discontinued change in the fair value of those transaction are marked to market and reported in the consolidated statement of income resulting in earnings volatility these change in fair value are captured in the non qualifying hedge category in computing adjusted earnings this could be significant to neer result because the economic offset to the position are not marked to market consequence nee net income reflects only the movement in one part of economically linked transaction for example gain loss in the non qualifying hedge category for certain energy derivative is offset by decrease increase in the fair value of related physical asset position in the portfolio or contract which are not marked to market under gaap for this reason nee management view result expressed excluding the unrealized mark to market impact of the non qualifying hedge meaningful measure of current period performance for additional information regarding derivative instrument see note overview and energy marketing and trading and market risk sensitivity accounting for pension and other postretirement benefitsnee sponsor qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all employee of nee and it subsidiary nee also ha supplemental executive retirement plan serp which includes non qualified supplemental defined benefit pension component that provides benefit to select group of management and highly compensated employee the impact of the serp component is included within the pension plan discussed below management belief that based on actuarial assumption and the well funded status of the pension plan nee will not be required to make any cash contribution to the qualified pension plan in the near future in addition to pension benefit nee sponsor contributory postretirement plan for health care and life insurance benefit other benefit plan for retiree of nee and it subsidiary meeting certain eligibility requirement the qualified pension plan ha fully funded trust dedicated to providing the benefit under the plan the other benefit plan ha partially funded trust dedicated to providing benefit related to life insurance nee allocates net periodic benefit income or cost associated with the pension and other benefit plan to it subsidiary annually using specific criterion of contentsnature of accounting estimatesfor the pension plan the benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of the december measurement date of all benefit attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered to that date the amount of benefit to be paid depends on number of future event incorporated into the pension benefit formula including estimate of the average life of employee survivor and average year of service rendered the projected benefit obligation is measured based on assumption concerning future interest rate and future employee compensation level for the other benefit plan the benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of the december measurement date of all future benefit attributed under the term of the other benefit plan to employee service rendered to that date nee derives pension income and the cost of the other benefit plan from actuarial calculation based on each plan provision and management assumption regarding discount rate rate of increase in compensation level and expected long term rate of return on plan asset and in the case of the other benefit plan health care cost trend rate assumption and accounting approachaccounting guidance requires recognition of the funded status of benefit plan in the balance sheet with change in the funded status recognized in other comprehensive income within shareholder equity in the year in which the change occur since nee is the plan sponsor and it subsidiary do not have separate right to the plan asset or direct obligation to their employee this accounting guidance is reflected at nee and not allocated to the subsidiary the portion of previously unrecognized actuarial gain and loss prior service cost or credit and transition obligation that are estimated to be allocable to fpl net periodic benefit income cost in future period and that otherwise would be recorded in aoci are classified regulatory asset and liability at nee in accordance with regulatory treatment pension income and the cost of the other benefit plan are included in expense and are calculated using number of actuarial assumption those assumption for the year ended december and include an expected long term rate of return on qualified plan asset of for the pension plan and and for the other benefit plan respectively assumed increase in salary of and weighted average discount rate of and for the pension plan and and for the other benefit plan respectively in developing these assumption nee evaluated input including other qualitative and quantitative factor from it actuary and consultant well information available in the marketplace in addition for the expected long term rate of return on fund asset nee considered different model capital market return assumption and historical return for portfolio with an equity bond asset mix similar to it fund well it fund historical compounded return nee belief that and are reasonable long term rate of return on it pension plan and other benefit plan asset nee will continue to evaluate all of it actuarial assumption including it expected rate of return at least annually and will adjust them necessary nee utilizes in it determination of pension and other benefit plan expense or income market related valuation of plan asset this market related valuation reduces year to year volatility and recognizes investment gain or loss over five year period following the year in which they occur investment gain or loss for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of plan asset and the actual return realized on those plan asset since the market related value of plan asset recognizes gain or loss over five year period the future value of plan asset will be affected previously deferred gain or loss are recognized such gain and loss together with other difference between actual result and the estimate used in the actuarial valuation are deferred and recognized in determining pension income and other benefit plan expense only to the extent they exceed of the greater of projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan asset the following table illustrates the effect on net periodic benefit income of changing the critical actuarial assumption discussed above while holding all other assumption constant increase decrease in periodic benefit income change inassumption nee fpl million expected long term rate of return discount rate nee also utilizes actuarial assumption about mortality to help estimate obligation of both the pension and other benefit plan in the society of actuary released revised mortality table and mortality improvement scale which nee adopted effective of contentsdecember the adoption of the new mortality table and mortality improvement scale did not have material impact on the pension and other benefit plan obligation see note carrying value of long lived assetsnee evaluates long lived asset for impairment when event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable nature of accounting estimatesthe amount of future net cash flow the timing of the cash flow and the determination of an appropriate interest rate all involve estimate and judgment about future event in particular the aggregate amount of cash flow determines whether an impairment exists and the timing of the cash flow is critical in determining fair value because each assessment is based on the fact and circumstance associated with each long lived asset the effect of change in assumption can not be generalized assumption and accounting approachan impairment loss is required to be recognized if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flow associated with that asset the impairment loss to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds the asset fair value in most instance the fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flow using an appropriate interest rate see note nonrecurring fair value measurement decommissioning and
