price to decline and you may lose all or part of investment additional risk trend and uncertainty not presently known to or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business financial condition result of operation or reputation risk related to our industry and marketsif we fail to meet the evolving need of our market or to identify new product service or technology our revenue and financial result may be adversely impacted our accelerated computing platform address four large market gaming data center professional visualization and automotive these market experience rapid change in technology customer requirement new product introduction and enhancement and industry standard our strategic and business success depends on our ability to timely identify emerging industry change and develop new or enhance existing product service and technology that meet the evolving need of these market expand the ecosystem for our product and technology accurately forecast demand in our business meet customer safety and compliance standard which are subject to change manage product software and service lifecycles to maintain customer and end user satisfaction develop infrastructure needed to scale our business including related to our acquisition customer support commerce and ip licensing capability and complete technical financial compliance sale and marketing investment for some of the activity we make considerable investment in research and development and business offering in market where we have limited operating history which may not produce meaningful revenue for several year if at all if we fail to develop new product service and technology or if they do not become widely adopted our business revenue financial condition and result of operation could be adversely affected achieving design win which is important to our success in several business may involve lengthy process and depend on our ability to anticipate feature and functionality that customer will demand unanticipated change in industry standard or disruptive technological innovation could render our product incompatible with product developed by other company if our product are not in compliance with prevailing industry and safety standard our customer may not incorporate our product into their design strategy failure to obtain particular design win may prevent from obtaining future design win in subsequent generation furthermore design win doe not guarantee revenue we can not ensure that our strategic direction will result in product and technology that provide value to our customer and partner if we fail to anticipate the changing need of our target market and emerging technology trend or if we do not appropriately adapt our strategy market condition evolve our business will be harmed of contentscompetition in our current and target market could prevent from growing our revenue our target market remain competitive and competition may intensify with expanding and changing product and service offering industry standard customer need new entrant and consolidation our competitor product service and technology such the high end discrete gpus offered by intel and amd may be cheaper or provide better functionality or feature than ours which may result in lower than expected selling price for our product some of our competitor operate their own fabrication facility have longer operating history larger customer base more comprehensive ip portfolio and patent protection new design and more design win and greater financial sale marketing and distribution resource than we do these competitor may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunity in new market and end user customer trend more quickly transition their product and secure sufficient foundry capacity and packaging material during supply constrained environment which could harm our business in our networking business some of our customer are also integrated circuit and switch supplier and have in house expertise and internal development capability similar to ours licensing our technology and supporting such customer entail the transfer of ip right that may enable such customer to develop their own solution to replace those we are providing if we are unable to successfully compete and respond to change in our target market or introduce new offering to meet the need of this competitive environment demand for our product service and technology could decrease which would cause our revenue to decline risk related to demand supply and manufacturingif we fail to estimate customer demand properly there may be mismatch supply and demand and our financial result could be harmed demand for our product is based on many factor including our product introduction and transition time to market competitor product release and announcement competing technology and other factor all of which can impact the timing and volume of our revenue we sell many of our product through channel partner who sell to retailer distributor and or end customer result the decision made by our channel partner retailer and distributor in response to changing market condition and demand for our product could impact our ability to properly forecast demand gpus have use case in addition to their designed and marketed use case such for digital currency mining including blockchain based platform such ethereum it is difficult for to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining on demand for our product volatility in the cryptocurrency market including new compute technology price change in cryptocurrencies government cryptocurrency policy and regulation new cryptocurrency standard and change in the method of verifying blockchain transaction have impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our product and can further impact our ability to estimate demand for our product change to cryptocurrency standard and process including but not limited to the pending ethereum standard may decrease the usage of gpus for ethereum mining well create increased aftermarket resale of our gpus impact retail price for our gpus increase return of our product in the distribution channel and may reduce demand for our new gpus we have introduced lite hash rate or lhr geforce gpus with limited ethereum mining capability and increased the supply of cmp in an effort to address demand from gamers and direct miner to cmp however if attempt in the aftermarket to improve the hash rate capability of our lhr card are successful our gaming card may become more attractive to miner increasing demand for our gaming gpus and limiting our ability to supply our gaming card to non mining customer we can not predict whether our strategy of using lhr card and cmp will achieve our desired outcome in addition our product may be resold on the unauthorized gray market which also make demand forecasting difficult gray market product compete with our distribution channel consumer and enterprise behavior during the covid pandemic such increased demand for our gaming data center and workstation product ha made it more difficult for to estimate future demand these challenge may continue in the future when the effect of the pandemic subside our manufacturing lead time are long and in some case extend to be twelve month or longer which requires to make estimate of customer future demand we have revised our process for purchasing supply result of the worldwide supply shortage impacting the semiconductor industry our inventory and purchase commitment reflect our demand expectation for our future quarter and long term supply and capacity need these condition could lead to significant mismatch between supply and demand giving rise to product shortage or excess inventory demand for our product may be perishable or may disappear which would make our demand forecast more uncertain and cause to lose market share perhaps permanently to shorten shipment lead time we may build finished product and carry inventory for anticipated demand that doe not materialize we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitment if customer cancel or defer order or choose to purchase from our competitor we may write our of contentsinventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or excess inventory and we could experience reduction in average selling price if we incorrectly forecast product demand situation that may result in excess inventory or related impairment include change in business and economic condition resulting in decreased consumer confidence including downturn in our target market and or overall economy and change in the credit market higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirement new product introduction resulting in le demand for existing product or inconsistent spike in demand due to unexpected end use case increase in demand for competitive product including competitive action fluctuation in demand for our product related to cryptocurrency mining or decrease in future demand decrease in the cost of supply chain material or change in the design of future product where we have entered into long term supply commitment including prepayment particularly to the extent we are placing order well in advance of our historical lead time and or before the design of those product is final conversely if we underestimate our customer demand for our product our foundry partner may not have adequate lead time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill order on timely basis we may also face supply constraint caused by natural disaster or other event if we are able to increase production level to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in cost effective or timely manner if we fail to fulfill our customer order on timely basis or at all our customer relationship could be damaged we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged in period of shortage impacting the semiconductor industry and or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain we are in today we have placed and may continue to place non cancellable inventory order in advance of our historical lead time and pay premium and or provide deposit to secure future supply and capacity for example while we previously placed order with approximately six month lead time we have begun placing order at least twelve month in advance our inventory and purchase commitment reflect our demand expectation for our future quarter and long term supply and capacity need however we may not be able to accurately predict when such period of shortage will end do we know whether those inventory order accurately address our current and future demand need these action may increase our product cost and trigger significant excess inventory or other charge if there is partial or complete reduction in long term demand for our product or if such demand is served by our competitor which could negatively impact our gross margin and our overall financial result we depend on third party and their technology to manufacture assemble test package or design our product which reduces our control over product quantity and quality manufacturing yield development enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business we do not manufacture the semiconductor used for our product and do not own or operate wafer fabrication facility we depend on foundry to manufacture our semiconductor wafer using their fabrication equipment and technique we do not assemble test or package our product but instead contract with independent subcontractor we also rely on third party software development tool to assist in the design simulation and verification of new product or product enhancement the design requirement necessary to meet consumer demand for greater functionality from our product may exceed the capability of available software development tool while we may enter into long term supply and capacity commitment we may not be able to secure sufficient commitment for capacity to address our business need we face several risk which could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and scale our supply chain negatively impact longer term demand for our product and service and adversely affect our business operation gross margin revenue and or financial result including lack of guaranteed supply of wafer component and capacity or decommitment and potential higher wafer and component price from incorrectly estimating demand and failing to place order with our supplier with sufficient quantity or in timely manner failure by our foundry or contract manufacturer to procure raw material or to provide adequate level of manufacturing or test capacity for our product of content failure by our foundry to develop obtain or successfully implement high quality process technology including transition to smaller geometry process technology such advanced process node technology and memory design needed to manufacture our product limited number of global supplier foundry contract manufacturer assembly and test provider and memory manufacturer loss of supplier and additional expense and or production delay result of qualifying new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of loss of or decision to add or change supplier lack of direct control over product quantity quality and delivery schedule delay in product shipment shortage decrease in product quality and or higher expense in the event our subcontractor or foundry prioritize our competitor order over ours and low manufacturing yield resulting from failure in our product design or foundry proprietary process technology if our product contain significant defect we could incur significant expense to remediate such defect our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market share our hardware and software product offering are complex and may contain defect or security vulnerability or experience failure or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issue in design fabrication packaging material and or use within system these risk may increase our product are introduced into new device market technology and application or new version are released some error in our product or service may only be discovered after product or service ha been shipped or used undiscovered vulnerability in our product or service could expose our end customer to unscrupulous third party who develop and deploy malicious software program that could attack our product or service defect or failure of our product to perform to specification could lead to substantial damage to the product or the product in which our device ha been integrated by oems odms aibs and tier automotive supplier and to the user of such end product any such defect may cause to incur significant warranty support and repair or replacement cost part of product recall or otherwise write off the value of related inventory and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development effort to find and correct the issue an error or defect in new product or release or related software driver after commencement of commercial shipment could result in failure to achieve market acceptance loss of design win and harm to our relationship with existing and prospective customer and partner and consumer perception of our brand which would in turn negatively impact our business operation gross margin revenue and or financial result we may be required to reimburse our customer partner or consumer including for cost to repair or replace product in the field if product liability claim is brought the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the effort of our technical and management personnel and harm our business further our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable term which could adversely impact our financial result risk related to our global operating businesswe are subject to risk and uncertainty associated with international operation including adverse economic condition which may harm our business we conduct our business and have office worldwide our semiconductor wafer are manufactured assembled tested and packaged by third party located outside of the united state and we generated of our revenue for fiscal year from sale outside of the united state the global nature of our business subject to number of risk and uncertainty which could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation including domestic and international economic and political condition between country in which we do business differing legal standard with respect to protection of ip and employment practice domestic and international business and cultural practice that differ disruption to capital market and or currency fluctuation of content natural disaster act of war or other military action terrorism public health issue and other catastrophic event adverse change in global regional or local economic condition including recession or slowing growth change or uncertainty in fiscal monetary or trade policy higher interest rate tighter credit inflation lower capital expenditure by business including on it infrastructure increase in unemployment and lower consumer confidence and spending periodically occur more recently increased inflation may impact supply employee facility and infrastructure cost to the extent such inflation continues increase or both it may reduce our margin and have material adverse effect on our financial performance economic and industry uncertainty or change could have adverse wide ranging effect on our business and financial result including decrease in demand for our product service and technology and those of our customer or licensee the inability of our supplier to deliver on their supply commitment to our customer or our licensee inability to supply product to customer and or end user the insolvency of key supplier distributor customer or licensee limit on our ability to forecast operating result and make business decision difficulty in obtaining capital reduced profitability may also cause some customer to scale back operation exit business merge with other manufacturer or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operation lead to consolidation or strategic alliance among other equipment manufacturer which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and increased credit and collectability risk higher borrowing cost or reduced availability of capital market reduced liquidity adverse impact on our supplier failure of counterparties including financial institution and insurer asset impairment and decline in the value of our financial instrument we have engineering sale support operation and manufacturing located in israel the state of israel and company with business in israel have been and could in future be the subject of an economic boycott other country have and may continue in the future restrict business with the state of israel and company with israeli operation such law and policy may have adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation climate change may have long term impact on our business climate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and those of our customer partner and vendor water and energy availability and reliability in the community where we conduct business is critical we have facility in region that may be vulnerable to the impact of extreme weather event extreme heat and wind coupled with dry condition in northern california may lead to power safety shut offs due to wildfire risk these measure can have adverse implication for our santa clara california headquarter office and data center including impairing the ability of our employee to work effectively climate change it impact on our supply chain and critical infrastructure worldwide and it potential to increase political instability in region where we our customer partner and our vendor do business may disrupt our business and may cause to experience higher attrition loss and cost to maintain or resume operation although we maintain program of insurance coverage for variety of property casualty and other risk the type and amount of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability and cost some of our policy have large deductible and broad exclusion and our insurance provider may be unable or unwilling to pay claim loss not covered by insurance may be large which could harm our result of operation and financial condition our operation product and service well those of our supplier and customer may also be subject to climate related law regulation and lawsuit regulation such carbon tax fuel or energy tax and pollution limit could result in greater direct cost including cost associated with change to manufacturing process or the procurement of raw material used in manufacturing process increased level of capital expenditure to improve facility and equipment and higher compliance and energy cost to reduce emission well greater indirect cost resulting from our customer supplier or both incurring additional compliance cost that are passed on to these cost and restriction could harm our business and result of operation by increasing our expense or requiring to alter our of contentsoperations and product design activity stakeholder group may find insufficiently responsive to the implication of climate change and therefore we may face legal action or reputational harm we may not achieve our stated goal to source of our global electricity use from renewable energy by the end of fiscal year which could harm our reputation or we may incur additional unexpected cost to achieve such goal we may also experience contractual dispute due to supply chain delay arising from climate change related disruption which could result in increased litigation and cost we also face risk related to business trend that may be influenced by climate change concern we may face decreased demand for computationally powerful but energy intensive product such our gpus despite their energy efficient design and operation and or increased consumer or customer expectation around the energy efficiency of our product could negatively impact our business we may not be able to realize the potential benefit of business investment or acquisition and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition target which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new product or sell our product we have and may continue to acquire and invest in business that offer product service and technology that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing strategic objective acquisition or investment involve significant challenge and risk and could impair our ability to grow our business develop new product or sell our product and ultimately could have negative impact on our financial result given that our resource are limited if we pursue particular transaction we may limit our ability to enter into other transaction that could help achieve our strategic objective if we are unable to timely complete acquisition including due to delay and challenge in obtaining regulatory approval we may be unable to pursue other transaction we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company technology may evolve and make the acquisition le attractive and other change can take place which could reduce the anticipated benefit of the transaction and negatively impact our business for example on february nvidia and softbank announced the termination of the share purchase agreement whereby nvidia would have acquired arm from softbank the party agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory challenge preventing the completion of the transaction we intend to record in operating expense billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year reflecting the write off of the prepayment provided at signing in september in addition to the extent that our perceived ability to consummate acquisition ha been harmed future acquisition may be more difficult complex or expensive further if we hold investment in publicly traded company they could create volatility in our result and may generate loss to the value of the investment risk related to acquisition or strategic investment include but are not limited to difficulty in integrating the technology product or operation and integrating and retaining the employee of the acquired business diversion of capital and other resource including management attention assumption of liability and incurring amortization expense impairment charge to goodwill or write down of acquired asset integrating accounting forecasting and control procedure and reporting cycle coordinating and integrating operation particularly in country in which we do not currently operate difficulty in realizing satisfactory return and uncertainty to realize the benefit of an acquisition or strategic investment if at all difficulty or inability in obtaining governmental regulatory approval or restriction or other consent and approval or financing stock price impact fine fee or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition legal proceeding initiated result of an acquisition or investment potential issuance of debt to finance our acquisition resulting in increased debt increased interest expense and compliance with debt covenant or other restriction of content the potential for our acquisition to result in dilutive issuance of our equity security the potential variability of the amount and form of any performance based consideration negative change in general economic condition in the region or the industry in which we or our target operate potential failure of our due diligence process to identify significant issue with the asset or company in which we are investing or are acquiring and impairment of relationship with or loss of our or our target employee vendor and customer result of our acquisition or investment system security and data protection breach well cyber attack could disrupt our operation reduce our expected revenue and increase our expense which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation security breach computer malware social engineering attack denial of service attack software bug server malfunction software or hardware failure loss of data or other information technology asset and other cyber attack are increasingly sophisticated making it more difficult to successfully detect defend against them or implement adequate preventative measure for example on february we became aware of security incident involving unauthorized access to our network by group of independent criminal threat actor not affiliated with any government or political cause the threat actor obtained nvidia network credential and through deception obtained two factor authentication capability and access to our network the threat actor misappropriated certain nvidia proprietary information including nvidia source code and leaked some of that information online upon learning of the security incident we engaged in remedial and preventative action rotated all nvidia network credential to prevent further unauthorized access hardened our network analyzed the information that the threat actor exfiltrated and notified law enforcement and other authority cyber attack including ransomware attack by organized criminal threat actor nation state and nation state supported actor may become more prevalent and severe our ability to recover from ransomware attack may be limited if our backup have been affected by the attack or if restoring from backup is delayed or not feasible threat actor sophisticated nation state and nation state supported actor now engage and are expected to continue to engage in cyber attack due to increasing geopolitical conflict we and the third party upon which we rely may be vulnerable to heightened risk of cyber attack furthermore we rely on product and service provided by third party supplier to operate certain critical business system including without limitation cloud based infrastructure encryption and authentication technology employee email and other function which expose to supply chain attack or other business disruption we can not guarantee that third party and infrastructure in our supply chain or our partner supply chain have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable defect or bug that could result in breach of or disruption to our information technology system including our product and service or the third party information technology system that support our service our ability to monitor these third party information security practice is limited and these may not have adequate information security measure in place in addition if one of our third party supplier suffers security breach our response may be limited or more difficult because we may not have direct access to their system log and other information related to the security breach to defend against cyber attack we must continuously engineer more secure product and enhance security and reliability feature which is expected to result in increased expense we must also continue to develop our security measure ensure our supplier have appropriate security measure in place and continue to meet the evolving security requirement of our customer we may not always be able to detect vulnerability in our security control system or software including third party software we have installed such threat and technique change frequently and may not be detected after security incident ha occurred further we may experience delay in developing and deploying remedial measure designed to address identified vulnerability breach of our security measure along with reported or perceived vulnerability or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about or third party could expose and the party affected to risk of loss or misuse of this information potentially resulting in litigation and subsequent liability regulatory inquiry or action damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business if we or third party we rely on experience security incident or are perceived to have experienced security incident we may experience adverse consequence including government enforcement action additional reporting requirement and or oversight restriction on processing data litigation indemnification obligation reputational harm diversion of fund financial of contentsloss loss of data material disruption in our system and operation supply chain and ability to produce sell and distribute our good and service and other similar harm inability to fulfill order delayed sale lower margin or lost customer result of these disruption could adversely affect our financial result stock price and reputation business disruption could harm our operation lead to decline in revenue and increase our cost our worldwide operation could be disrupted by natural disaster and extreme weather condition power or water shortage telecommunication failure cloud service provider outage terrorist attack or act of violence political and or civil unrest act of war or other military action epidemic or pandemic and other natural or man made disaster and catastrophic event our corporate headquarters large portion of our current data center capacity and portion of our research and development activity are located in california and other critical business operation finished good inventory and some of our supplier are located in asia making our operation vulnerable to natural disaster such earthquake wildfire or other business disruption occurring in these geographical area catastrophic event can also have an impact on third party vendor who provide critical infrastructure service for it and research and development system and personnel geopolitical and domestic political development and other event beyond our control can increase economic volatility globally political instability change in government or adverse political development in or around any of the major country in which we do business would also likely harm our business financial condition and result of operation for example the invasion by russia of ukraine ha had and will likely continue to have negative impact on our employee or operation both within and outside these region and may result in the loss of some or even all of our asset in those region our operation could be harmed and our cost could increase if manufacturing logistics or other operation are disrupted for any reason including natural disaster high heat event or water shortage information technology system failure military action or economic business labor environmental public health or political issue for example our operation could be harmed and our cost could increase if the conflict between russia and ukraine result in shortage of key material that our supplier including our foundry partner require to satisfy our need the ultimate impact on our third party foundry and other supplier of being located and consolidated in certain geographical area is unknown in the event disaster war or catastrophic event affect or the third party system on which we rely our business could be harmed result of decline in revenue increase in expense and substantial expenditure and time spent to fully resume operation all of these risk and condition could materially adversely affect our future sale and operating result we receive significant amount of our revenue from limited number of customer and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customer we receive significant amount of our revenue from limited number of customer within our distribution and partner network with several of these distributor and partner we are selling multiple target market platform through their channel our operating result depend on sale within our partner network well the ability of these partner to sell product that incorporate our processor in the future these partner may decide to purchase fewer product not to incorporate our product into their ecosystem or to alter their purchasing pattern in some other way because most of our sale are made on purchase order basis our customer can cancel change or delay product purchase commitment with little or no notice to and without penalty our partner or customer may develop their own solution our customer may purchase product from our competitor and our partner may discontinue sale or lose market share in the market for which they purchase our product all of which may alter partner or customer purchasing pattern the loss of any of our large customer significant reduction in purchase by them our inability to sell to customer due to trade restriction or any difficulty in collecting account receivable would likely harm our financial condition and result of operation if we are unable to attract retain and motivate our executive and key employee our business may be harmed to be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully we must attract retain and motivate our executive and key employee and recruit and develop diverse talent labor is subject to external factor that are beyond our control including our industry highly competitive market for skilled worker and leader cost inflation the covid pandemic and workforce participation rate we also must recruit and develop diverse talent change in immigration and work permit regulation or in their administration or interpretation could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employee if we are le successful in our recruiting effort or if we can not retain key employee our business may be adversely affected competition for personnel result in increased cost in the form of cash and stock based compensation we also must retain the key personnel hired result of our acquisition or it could reduce the anticipated benefit of those transaction we are highly dependent on the service of our longstanding executive team failure to ensure effective succession planning transfer of knowledge and smooth transition involving executive and key employee could hinder our strategic planning and execution and long term success of contentsour business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our business process and information system and modification or interruption of such system may disrupt our business process and internal control we rely upon internal process and information system to support key business function including our assessment of internal control over financial reporting required by section of the sarbanes oxley act the efficient operation of these process and system is critical and they need to be scalable to support our growth including for acquisition of other business we expect in the first quarter of fiscal year to commence implementation of accounting and consolidation functionality related to new enterprise resource planning or erp system any erp system problem upon implementation such quality issue or programming error could impact our continued ability to successfully operate our business or to timely and accurately report our financial result these change may be costly and disruptive to our operation and could impose substantial demand on management time failure to implement new or updated control or difficulty encountered in their implementation could harm our operating result or cause to fail to meet our reporting obligation identification of material weakness in our internal control even if quickly remediated disclosed may cause investor to lose confidence in our financial statement and our stock price may decline remediation of any material weakness could require to incur significant expense and if we fail to remediate any material weakness our financial statement may be inaccurate we may be required to restate our financial statement our ability to report our financial result on timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected our access to the capital market may be restricted the trading price of our common stock may decline and we may be subject to sanction or investigation by regulatory authority the covid pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and result of operation covid ha impacted and continues to impact our workforce and operation and those of our customer partner vendor and supplier the covid pandemic continues to evolve the increased duration and impact of economic and demand uncertainty and the limited availability of our supply chain and logistical service may have material net negative impact on our business and financial result while covid ha driven an increase in sale for certain of our product the demand may not be sustainable if condition change covid containment around the world ha put restriction on among other area manufacturing facility commerce and support operation could limit our capacity to meet customer demand stronger demand globally ha limited the availability of capacity and component in our supply chain which could increase our cost limit our ability to obtain supply at necessary level or at all or cause to hold excess inventory if demand change covid effect on the global economy and our business is difficult to ass or predict it ha resulted in and may continue to result in disruption of global financial market which could negatively affect our stock price and liquidity volatility in the financial market could impact overall technology spending adversely affecting demand for our product our business and the value of our common stock we have modified our business and workforce practice in response to covid and we may take further action required by government regulation or in the best interest of our employee customer partner and supplier there is no certainty that our action will be sufficient to mitigate the risk posed by the disease and our ability to perform critical function could be harmed when we begin to reopen our office we expect to incur incremental expense we resume onsite service and related in office cost the extent of the impact of the covid pandemic on our operational and financial performance and our ability to timely execute our business strategy may continue to be difficult to measure and predict an extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption result of the covid pandemic could have material negative impact on our business result of operation and access to source of liquidity and financial condition though the full extent and duration of these impact is uncertain our operating result have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate and if our operating result are below the expectation of security analyst or investor our stock price could decline our operating result have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate due to numerous factor described in these risk factor therefore investor should not rely on past comparison of our result of operation an indication of our future performance additional factor that could affect our result of operation include but are not limited to our ability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfall due to the multi year development cycle for some of our product and service of content our ability to comply with our customer contractual obligation the inability of some customer to make required payment our ability to obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customer and customer bad debt write offs unanticipated cost associated with environmental liability and change in financial accounting standard or interpretation of existing standard any one or more of the factor discussed above could prevent from achieving our expected future financial result any such failure to meet our expectation or the expectation of our investor or security analyst could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility risk related to regulatory legal our stock and other mattersour operation could be affected by the complex law rule and regulation to which our business is subject and political and other action may adversely impact our business we are subject to law and regulation domestically and worldwide affecting our operation in area including but not limited to ip ownership and infringement tax import and export requirement and tariff anti corruption business acquisition foreign exchange control and cash repatriation restriction data privacy requirement competition and antitrust advertising employment product regulation cybersecurity environmental health and safety requirement the responsible use of ai climate change cryptocurrency and consumer law compliance with such requirement can be onerous and expensive could impact our competitive position and may impact our business operation negatively for example the foreign corrupt practice act and other anti corruption law and regulation prohibit from engaging in certain business practice there can be no assurance that our employee contractor supplier or agent will not violate policy control and procedure that we have designed to help ensure compliance with applicable law violation of these law and regulation can result in fine criminal sanction against our officer or our employee prohibition on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation should any of these law rule and regulation be amended or expanded or new one enacted we could incur materially greater compliance cost and or restriction on our ability to manufacture our product and operate our business for example we may face increased compliance cost result of change or increase in anti competition legislation regulation administrative rule making and enforcement activity resulting from growing public concern over concentration of economic power in corporation government action including trade protection and national security policy of and foreign government body such tariff import or export regulation including deemed export restriction trade and economic sanction decree quota or other trade barrier and restriction could affect our ability to ship product provide service to our customer and employee do business without an export license with entity on the department of commerce entity list or other government restricted party list which is expected to change from time to time and generally fulfill our contractual obligation and have material adverse effect on our business for example in response to the russian invasion of ukraine the united state and certain ally have imposed economic sanction and export control measure and may impose additional sanction or export control measure which have and could in the future result in among other thing severe or complete restriction on export to and other commerce and business dealing involving russia certain region of ukraine and or particular entity and individual such action have limited or blocked or could in the future limit or block the passage of our product service and support into russia or other region determined to be supporting russia and restrict access by our russian or ukrainian employee both within and outside of russia and ukraine to our system negatively impacting productivity given these recent sanction and export restriction imposed by the united state and foreign government body we recently ceased product sale to russia while we have policy and procedure in place to ensure compliance with sanction and trade restriction our employee contractor partner and agent may take action in violation of such policy and applicable law for which we may be ultimately held responsible if we were ever found to have violated export control law we may be subject to various penalty available under the law any of which could have material and adverse impact on our business operating result and financial condition additionally change in the public perception of government in the region where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our business and result of operation geopolitical tension and conflict worldwide including but not limited to taiwan china hong kong israel and korea where the manufacture of our product component and final assembly of our product are concentrated may result in changing regulatory requirement trade policy export control import duty and economic disruption that could impact our operating strategy product demand access to global market hiring and profitability the increasing focus on the strategic importance of ai technology may result in additional regulatory restriction that target product of contentsand service capable of enabling or facilitating ai including some or all of our product and service offering such restriction could limit our ability to serve demand abroad and could negatively impact our business and financial result deemed export control limitation could negatively impact the ability of our research and development team to execute our roadmap or other objective in timely manner recent restriction imposed by the chinese government on the duration of gaming activity and access to game may adversely affect our gaming business additionally revision to law or regulation or their interpretation and enforcement could result in increased taxation trade sanction the imposition of import duty or tariff restriction and control on import or export or other retaliatory action which could have an adverse effect on our business plan or impact the timing of our shipment issue relating to the responsible use of ai in our offering may result in reputational harm and liability concern relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technology such ai in our product and service may result in reputational harm and liability and may cause to incur cost to resolve such issue we are increasingly building ai capability into many of our product and service ai present risk and challenge that could affect it adoption and therefore our business ai pose emerging ethical issue and if we enable or offer solution that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society or if we are unable to develop effective internal policy and framework relating to the responsible development and use of ai model and system offered through our sale channel we may experience brand or reputational harm competitive harm or legal liability compliance with government regulation in the area of ai ethic may also increase the cost of related research and development our failure to address concern relating to the responsible use of ai by or others could undermine public confidence in ai and slow adoption of ai in our product and service or cause reputational harm increased scrutiny from shareholder and others regarding our environmental social and governance responsibility could result in additional cost or risk and adversely impact our reputation and willingness of customer and supplier to do business with shareholder advocacy group certain institutional investor investment fund other market participant shareholder and customer have focused increasingly on the esg and sustainability practice of company including those associated with climate change and human right these party have placed increased importance on the implication of the social cost of their investment if our esg practice do not meet shareholder or other industry stakeholder expectation and standard which continue to evolve our brand reputation and business activity may be negatively impacted any sustainability report that we publish or other sustainability disclosure we make may include our policy and practice on variety of social and ethical matter including corporate governance environmental compliance employee health and safety practice human capital management product quality supply chain management and talent diversity and inclusion practice it is possible that stakeholder may not be satisfied with our esg practice or the speed of their adoption we could also incur additional cost and require additional resource to monitor report and comply with various esg practice or choose not to conduct business with potential customer or discontinue or not expand business with existing customer due to our policy also our failure or perceived failure to meet the standard included in any sustainability disclosure could have material negative impact on our reputation and business activity action to adequately protect our ip right could result in substantial cost to and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our product from time to time we are involved in lawsuit or other legal proceeding alleging patent infringement or other ip right violation by our employee or party that we have agreed to indemnify for claim of infringement an unfavorable ruling could include significant damage invalidation of one or more patent indemnification of third party payment of lost profit or injunctive relief claim that our product or process infringe the ip right of others regardless of their merit could cause to incur significant cost to respond to defend and resolve such claim and they may also divert the effort and attention of management and technical personnel we may commence legal proceeding in order to protect our ip right which may increase our operating expense and negatively impact our operating result we could be subject to countersuit result if infringement claim are made against or our product are found to infringe third party ip we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek license to the third party ip right however we may not be able to obtain license at all or on term acceptable to if we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain such license we could be subject to substantial liability or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our product we may also have to make royalty or other payment or cross license our technology if these arrangement are not concluded on commercially reasonable of contentsterms our business could be negatively impacted furthermore the indemnification of customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expense which could negatively impact our operating result we rely on patent trademark trade secret employee and third party nondisclosure agreement licensing arrangement and the law of the country in which we operate to protect our ip foreign law may not protect our product or ip right to the same extent united state law this make the possibility of piracy of our technology and product more likely the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secret and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our product result the value of our investment in research and development product development and marketing could be reduced we also may face risk to our ip if our employee are hired by potential competitor we continuously ass whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovation and technology but can not be certain whether our application for such protection will be approved and if approved whether we will be able to enforce such protection we are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security obligation privacy concern relating to our product and service could damage our reputation deter current and potential

greater and individual may initiate litigation related to our processing of their personal data furthermore there exists proposed european regulation related to ai that if adopted could impose onerous obligation and could require to change our business practice certain jurisdiction have enacted data localization law and cross border personal data transfer law for example the gdpr generally restricts the transfer of personal data to country outside of the eea the european commission released set of standard contractual clause designed for entity to validly transfer personal data of the eea to jurisdiction that the european commission ha not found to provide an adequate level of protection including the united state other jurisdiction have enacted or are considering similar cross border personal data transfer law and local personal data residency law any of which could increase the cost and complexity of business the inability to import personal data to the united state could significantly and negatively impact our business operation limit our ability to collaborate with party that are subject to european and other data privacy and security law or require to increase our

establish the california privacy protection agency to impose administrative fine virginia passed the consumer data protection act and colorado passed the colorado privacy act both of which differ from the cpra and become effective in if we become subject to new data privacy law the risk of enforcement action against could increase we become subject to additional obligation the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection law in the united state europe and elsewhere are quickly changing and may be interpreted and applied in an increasingly stringent fashion and in manner that is of contentsinconsistent with our data practice these obligation may necessitate change to our information technology system and practice and to those of any third party that process personal data on our behalf despite our effort our personnel or third party upon we rely may fail to comply with such obligation if we fail or are perceived to have failed to address or comply with data privacy and security obligation we could face significant consequence including but not limited to government enforcement action litigation additional reporting requirement and or oversight ban on processing personal data and order to destroy or not use personal data any of these event could have material adverse effect on our reputation business or financial condition we have exposure to tax liability

jurisdiction for example we are currently under examination by the internal revenue service for our fiscal year and and under audit in germany israel and india although we believe our tax estimate are reasonable tax authority may disagree with certain position we have taken and any adverse outcome of such review or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate increase the amount of non income tax imposed on our business and harm our financial position result of operation and cash flow further change in united state federal and state or international tax law applicable to multinational corporation or other fundamental law change including proposed change to existing tax rule and regulation under the current administration and congress and result of recommendation from intergovernmental economic organization such the organization for economic cooperation and development or oecd may materially impact our tax expense and cash flow we experienced in fiscal year with the passage of the tax cut and job act or tcja starting in fiscal year the tcja requires taxpayer to capitalize research and development expenditure and to amortize domestic expenditure over five year and foreign expenditure over fifteen year if congress doe not modify or repeal this provision it will materially reduce our cash flow beginning in fiscal year furthermore recent proposal to increase the corporate income tax rate or impose minimum tax on financial statement income increase taxation of international business operation and impose global minimum tax could result in increased marginal corporate tax rate numerous country well organization such the oecd support the global minimum tax initiative and are considering change to existing tax law or have proposed or enacted new law that

litigation investigation and regulatory proceeding we currently and will likely continue to face legal administrative and regulatory proceeding claim demand and or investigation involving shareholder consumer competition and or other issue relating to our business for example we are currently defending on appeal the dismissal of security class action lawsuit from multiple shareholder seeking to assert claim that we and certain of our officer made false and or misleading statement related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on gpu demand in and litigation and regulatory proceeding are inherently uncertain and adverse ruling could occur including monetary damage or fine or an injunction stopping from manufacturing or selling certain product engaging in

regulatory challenge preventing the completion of the transaction we intend to record in operating expense billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year reflecting the write off of the prepayment provided at signing in september demanddemand for our product is based on many factor including our product introduction time to market transition competitor product release and announcement and competing technology all of which can impact the timing and volume of our revenue gpus have use case in addition to their designed and marketed use case such for digital currency mining including blockchain based platform such ethereum it is difficult for to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining on demand for our product volatility in the cryptocurrency market including new compute technology price change in cryptocurrencies government cryptocurrency policy and regulation and new cryptocurrency standard can impact and have impacted in the past cryptocurrency demand and further impact demand for our product and our ability to estimate demand for our product change to cryptocurrency standard and process including but not limited to the pending ethereum standard may decrease the usage of gpus for ethereum mining and may also create increased aftermarket resale of our gpus impact retail price for our gpus increase return of our product in the distribution channel and may reduce demand for our new gpus we have introduced lhr geforce gpus with limited ethereum mining capability and increased the supply of cmp in an effort to address demand from gamers and direct miner to cmp beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year nearly all our desktop nvidia ampere architecture geforce gpu shipment were lhr in our effort to direct geforce to gamers if attempt in the aftermarket to improve the hash rate capability of our lhr card are successful our gaming card may become more attractive to miner and therefore limit our ability to supply our card to non mining customer we can not predict whether our strategy of using lhr card and cmp will achieve our desired outcome additionally consumer and enterprise behavior during the covid pandemic ha made it more difficult for to estimate future demand and may have changed pre pandemic behavior and these challenge may be more pronounced or volatile in the future on both global and regional basis in estimating demand and evaluating trend we make multiple assumption any of which may prove to be incorrect supply our manufacturing lead time are very long and in some case extend to be twelve month or longer which requires to make estimate of customer future demand these condition could lead to significant mismatch between supply and demand giving rise to product shortage or excess inventory and make our demand forecast more uncertain to of contentshave shorter shipment lead time and quicker delivery schedule for our customer we may build finished product and maintain inventory for anticipated period of growth which do not occur anticipating demand that doe not materialize or for what we believe is pent up demand during fiscal year we made substantial stride in broadening our supply base to scale our company and better serve customer demand we expect to remain supply constrained into the first half of fiscal year primarily in gaming and networking we have placed non cancellable inventory order for certain supply in advance of our historical lead time paid premium and provided deposit to secure future supply and capacity and may need to continue to do so in the future ordering product in advance of our historical lead time to secure supply in constrained environment may trigger excess inventory or other charge if there is partial or complete reduction in long term demand for our product or if such demand is served by our competitor given our long lead time on inventory purchasing demand may be perishable or may disappear given our current long lead time we may order component before our product design is finalized and change to the product design or end demand could trigger excess inventory our supply delivery and production may be non linear within quarter or year which could cause change to expected revenue or cash flow covid covid pandemic continued during fiscal year most of our employee continue to work remotely and we have paused most business travel during fiscal year our gaming data center and professional visualization market platform have benefited from stronger demand people continue to work learn and play from home our professional visualization market platform also benefited from demand for workstation enterprise support hybrid work environment our office begin to reopen we expect to incur incremental expense we resume onsite service and related in office cost the covid pandemic continues the timing and overall demand from customer the availability of supply chain logistical service and component supply and the impact of rising inflation may have material net negative impact on our business and financial result we believe our existing balance of cash cash equivalent and marketable security along with commercial paper arrangement will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital need capital

application these platform incorporate processor interconnects software algorithm system and service to deliver unique value our platform address four large market where our expertise is critical gaming data center professional visualization and automotive revenue for fiscal year wa billion up from year ago gaming revenue wa up from year ago reflecting higher sale of geforce gpus we continue to benefit from strong demand for nvidia ampere architecture product and believe the increase in gaming revenue during fiscal year resulted from combination of factor including the ramp of new rtx series gpus the release of new game supporting ray tracing the rising popularity of gaming esports content creation and streaming the demand for new and upgraded system to support the increase in remote work and the ability of end user to engage in cryptocurrency mining of contentsalthough nearly all desktop nvidia ampere architecture geforce gpu shipment are lhr to help direct geforce gpus to gamers our gpus are capable of cryptocurrency mining gamers and others are therefore able to mine cryptocurrency using our gpus although we have limited visibility into how much this impact our overall gpu demand volatility in the cryptocurrency market including change in the price of cryptocurrencies or method of verifying transaction such proof of work or proof of stake can impact demand for our product and degrade our ability to accurately estimate it we are unable to estimate with any degree of precision the impact this volatility is likely to have in the future data center revenue wa up from year ago primarily driven by sale of nvidia ampere architecture gpus across both training and inference for cloud computing and ai workload such natural language processing and deep recommender model professional visualization revenue wa up from year ago driven by the ramp of nvidia ampere architecture product and strong demand for workstation enterprise support hybrid work environment well growth in workload such design ai and rendering automotive revenue wa up from year ago due to self driving and ai cockpit solution offset by decline in legacy cockpit revenue oem and other revenue wa up from year ago primarily driven by cmp sale cmp revenue wa million for the fiscal year and wa nominal in the prior year revenue for our cmp product declined significantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal year we are unable to estimate with any degree of precision the impact that volatility in the cryptocurrency market discussed above is likely to have on future cmp sale gross margin for fiscal year wa up basis point from year ago driven by lower mellanox acquisition related charge including non recurring inventory step up charge of million in fiscal year margin also benefited from higher end mix within gaming partially offset by mix shift within data center operating expense for fiscal year were up from year ago primarily driven by stock based compensation compensation related cost associated with employee growth and higher infrastructure cost income from operation wa billion up from year ago net income and net income per diluted share were billion and

based on our inventory level and future product purchase commitment compared to assumption about future demand and market condition situation that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include change in business and economic condition change in market condition sudden and significant decrease in demand for our product inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirement new product introduction resulting in le demand for existing product or inconsistent spike in demand due to unexpected end use case failure to estimate customer demand properly ordering in

place non cancellable inventory order for certain product in advance of our historical lead time pay premium and provide deposit to secure future supply and capacity we also adjust to other market factor such product offering and pricing action by our competitor new product transition and macroeconomic condition all of which may impact demand for our product refer to the gross profit and gross margin discussion below in this management discussion and analysis for further discussion revenue recognitionwe derive our revenue from product sale including hardware and system license and

consolidationour consolidated financial statement include the account of nvidia corporation and our wholly owned subsidiary all intercompany balance and transaction have been eliminated in consolidation use of estimatesthe preparation of financial statement in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset and liability and disclosure of contingent asset and liability at the date of the financial statement and the reported amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period actual result could differ materially from our estimate on an on going basis we evaluate our estimate including those related to revenue recognition cash equivalent and marketable security account receivable inventory income tax goodwill stock based compensation litigation investigation and settlement cost restructuring and other charge and other contingency the input into our judgment and estimate consider the economic implication of covid these estimate are based on historical fact and various other assumption that we believe are reasonable revenue recognitionwe derive our revenue from product sale including hardware and system license and development arrangement software licensing and cloud service we determine revenue recognition through the following step identification of the contract with customer identification of the performance obligation in the contract determination of the transaction price allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligation in the contract where revenue is allocated on relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable input to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation and recognition of revenue when or we satisfy performance obligation product sale revenuerevenue from product sale is recognized upon transfer of control of product to customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those product certain product are sold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system hardware and or software support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period or service are performed revenue is recognized net of allowance for return customer program and any tax collected from customer for product sold with right of return we record reduction to revenue by establishing sale return allowance for estimated product return at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rate however if product return for fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rate we may determine that additional sale return allowance are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product return of contentsnvidia corporation and subsidiariesnotes to the consolidated financial statement continued our customer program involve rebate which are designed to serve sale incentive to resellers of our product in various target market and marketing development fund or mdfs which represent monies paid to our partner that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partner activity while also promoting nvidia product we account for customer program reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebate and mdfs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customer license and development arrangementsour license and development arrangement with customer typically require significant customization of our ip component result we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development service single performance obligation over the period in which the development service are performed we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project if loss on an arrangement becomes probable during period we record provision for such loss in that period software licensingour software license provide our customer with right to use the software when it is made available to the customer customer may purchase either perpetual license or subscription to license which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefit from the software software license are frequently sold along with the right to receive on when and if available basis future unspecified software update and upgrade revenue from software license is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer software support revenue is recognized ratably over the service period or service are performed cloud servicescloud service which allow customer to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software are provided on subscription basis or combination of subscription plus usage revenue related to subscription based cloud service is recognized ratably over the contract period revenue related to cloud service based on usage is recognized usage occurs product warrantieswe generally offer limited warranty to end user that range from one to three year for product in order to repair or replace product for any manufacturing defect or hardware component failure cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranty that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition under limited circumstance we may offer an extended limited warranty to customer for certain product we also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issue if loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated stock based compensationwe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant minus dividend yield discount the fair value of award of restricted stock unit or rsus and performance stock unit that are based on our corporate financial performance target or psus we use monte carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock unit that are based on market condition or market based psus the compensation expense for rsus and market based psus is recognized using straight line attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for psus is recognized using an accelerated amortization model we estimate the fair value of share to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan or espp using the black scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in march and september of each year stock based compensation for our espp is expensed using an accelerated amortization model additionally we estimate forfeiture at least annually based on historical experience and revise the estimate of forfeiture in subsequent period if actual forfeiture differ from those estimate litigation investigation and settlement costswe currently are and will likely continue to be subject to claim litigation and other action including potential regulatory proceeding involving patent and other intellectual property matter tax labor and employment competition and antitrust commercial dispute good and service offered by and by third party and other matter there are many uncertainty associated with any litigation or investigation and we can not be certain that these action or other third party claim against will be resolved without litigation fine and or substantial of contentsnvidia corporation and subsidiariesnotes to the consolidated financial statement continued settlement payment or judgement if information becomes available that cause to determine that loss in any of our pending litigation investigation or settlement is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such event we will record the loss in accordance with gaap however the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimate which could require to record additional cost foreign currency remeasurementwe use the united state dollar our functional currency for all of our subsidiary foreign currency monetary asset and liability are remeasured into united state dollar at end of period exchange rate non monetary asset and liability such property

balance sheet amount which are remeasured at historical exchange rate gain or loss from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings in our consolidated statement of income and to date have not been significant income taxeswe recognize federal state and foreign current tax liability or asset based on our estimate of tax payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax asset or liability appropriate for our estimate of future tax effect attributable to temporary difference and carryforwards and we record valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax asset by the amount of any tax benefit that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized our calculation of deferred tax asset and liability is based on certain estimate and judgment and involves dealing with uncertainty in the application of complex tax law our estimate of deferred tax asset and liability may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome change in accounting standard or tax law in the united state or foreign jurisdiction where we operate or change in other fact or circumstance in addition we recognize liability for potential united state and foreign income tax contingency based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax may be due if we determine that payment of these amount is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is le than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statement accordingly of january we had valuation allowance of million related to state and certain other deferred tax asset that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projection of future taxable income tax attribute usage limitation by certain jurisdiction and potential utilization limitation of tax attribute acquired result of stock ownership change to the extent realization of the deferred tax asset becomes more likely than not we would recognize such deferred tax asset an income tax benefit during the period we recognize the benefit from tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merit of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalty related to unrecognized tax benefit component of income tax expense net income per sharebasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common share outstanding
