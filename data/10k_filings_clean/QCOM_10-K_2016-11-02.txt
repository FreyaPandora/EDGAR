price of our common stock following the proposed transaction could decline to the extent our financial result are materially affected by any of these event our revenue depend on commercial network deployment expansion and upgrade of cdma ofdma and other communication technology our customer and licensee sale of product and service based on these technology and customer demand for our product and service we develop patent and commercialize technology and product based on cdma ofdma and other communication technology which are primarily wireless we depend on operator of wireless network and our customer and licensee to adopt these technology for use in their network device and service we also depend on our customer and licensee to develop device and service based on these technology with value added feature to drive consumer demand for new multimode and device well establishing the selling price for such device further we depend on the timing of our customer and licensee deployment of new device and service based on these technology increasingly we also depend on operator of wireless network our customer and licensee and other third party to incorporate these technology into new device type and into industry beyond traditional cellular communication such automotive the iot including the connected home smart city and wearable data center networking mobile computing mobile health and learning including robotics among others we are also impacted by consumer rate of replacement of smartphones and other computing device our revenue and or growth in revenue could be negatively impacted our business may be harmed and our substantial investment in these technology may not provide an adequate return if wireless operator and industry beyond traditional cellular communication deploy alternative technology wireless operator delay and multimode network deployment expansion or upgrade and or delay moving customer to multimode or wireless device lte an ofdma based wireless technology is not more widely deployed or further commercial deployment is delayed government regulator delay making sufficient spectrum available for new unlicensed technology that we are developing in conjunction with and well for thereby restricting the ability of wireless operator to deploy or expand the use of these technology wireless operator delay or do not drive improvement in or multimode network performance and or capacity our customer and licensee revenue and sale of product particularly premium tier product and service using these technology do not grow or do not grow quickly anticipated due to for example the maturity of smartphone penetration in developed region our intellectual property and technical leadership included in the standardization effort is different than in and standard the standardization and or deployment of technology is delayed and or we are unable to drive the adoption of our product and service into network and device including device beyond traditional cellular application based on cdma ofdma and other communication technology our industry is subject to competition in an environment of rapid technological change that could result in decreased demand and or declining average selling price for our product and or those of our customer and or licensee our product service and technology face significant competition we expect competition to increase our current competitor expand their product offering or reduce the price of their product part of strategy to attract new business and or customer new opportunity develop and new competitor enter the industry competition in wireless communication is affected by various factor that include among others device manufacturer concentration growth in demand consumption and competition in emerging geographic region government intervention and or support of national industry and or competitor evolving industry standard and business model evolving method of transmission of voice and data communication increasing data traffic and densification of wireless network convergence and aggregation of connectivity technology including wi fi and lte in both device and access point consolidation of wireless technology and infrastructure at the network edge networking and connectivity trend including cloud service use of both licensed and unlicensed spectrum the evolving nature of computing including demand for always on always connected capability the speed of technological change including the transition to smaller geometry process technology value added feature that drive selling price well consumer demand for new multimode and device turnkey integrated product that incorporate hardware software user interface application and reference design scalability and the ability of the system technology to meet customer immediate and future network requirement we anticipate that additional competitor will introduce product result of growth opportunity in wireless communication the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitor technological and public policy change and relatively low barrier to entry in certain segment of the industry additionally the semiconductor industry ha experienced and may continue to experience consolidation which could result in significant change to the competitive landscape we expect that our future success will depend on among other factor our ability to differentiate our integrated circuit product with innovative technology across multiple product and feature modem rffe graphic and or other processor camera and connectivity and with smaller geometry process technology that drive performance develop and offer integrated circuit product at competitive cost and price point to effectively cover both emerging and developed geographic region and all device tier continue to drive the adoption of our integrated circuit product into the most popular device model and across broad spectrum of device such smartphones tablet other computing device automobile wearable and other connected device and infrastructure product maintain and or accelerate demand for our integrated circuit product at the premium device tier while increasing the adoption of our product in mid and low tier device in part by strengthening our integrated circuit product roadmap for and developing channel relationship in emerging geographic region such china and india and by providing turnkey product which incorporate our integrated circuit for low and mid tier smartphones and tablet continue to be leader in technology evolution including expansion of our lte based single mode licensing program in area where single mode product are commercialized and continue to innovate and introduce turnkey integrated product and service that differentiate from our competition be leader serving original equipment manufacturer high level operating system hlos provider operator and other industry participant competitor new industry entrant and other factor continue to affect the industry landscape be preferred partner and sustain preferred relationship providing integrated circuit product that support multiple operating system and infrastructure platform to industry participant that effectively commercialize new device using these platform increase and or accelerate demand for our semiconductor component product including rffe and our wired and wireless connectivity product including networking product for consumer carrier and enterprise equipment and connected device identify potential acquisition target that will grow or sustain our business or address strategic need reach agreement on term acceptable to and effectively integrate these new business and or technology create standalone value and or contribute to the success of our existing business through acquisition joint venture and other transaction and or by developing customer licensee and or vendor relationship in new industry segment and or disruptive technology product and or service such product for automotive the iot including the connected home smart city and wearable data center networking mobile computing mobile health and machine learning including robotics among others become leading supplier of radio frequency front end product which are designed to address cellular radio frequency band fragmentation while improving radio frequency performance and assist original equipment manufacturer in developing multiband multimode mobile device be leader in technology development standardization intellectual property creation and licensing and develop and commercialize integrated circuit product and service and or continue to develop brand recognition to effectively compete against better known company in mobile computing and other consumer driven segment and to deepen our presence in significant emerging geographic region competition in any or all product tier may result in the loss of certain business or customer which would negatively impact our revenue and operating result such competition may also reduce average selling price for our chipset product and or the product of our customer and licensee certain of these dynamic are particularly pronounced in emerging geographic region where competitor may have lower cost structure and or may have willingness and ability to accept lower price and or lower or negative margin on their product particularly in china reduction in the average selling price of our chipset product without corresponding increase in volume would negatively impact our revenue and without corresponding decrease in average unit cost would negatively impact our margin in addition reduction in the average selling price of our licensee product unless offset by an increase in volume would generally decrease total royalty payable to negatively impacting our licensing revenue company that promote standard that are neither cdma nor ofdma based gsm well company that design integrated circuit based on cdma ofdma wi fi or their derivative are generally competitor or potential competitor example some of which are strategic partner of ours in other area include broadcom limited cirrus logic ericsson hisilicon technology intel leadcore technology co ltd marvell technology maxim integrated product mediatek microchip technology inc nvidia qorvo inc realtek semiconductor samsung electronics skyworks solution inc and spreadtrum communication which is controlled by tsinghua unigroup some of these current and potential competitor may have advantage over that include among others motivation by our customer in certain circumstance to utilize their own internally developed integrated circuit product to use our competitor integrated circuit product or to choose alternative technology lower cost structure and or willingness and ability to accept lower price lower or negative margin for their product particularly in china foreign government support of other technology or competitor better known brand name ownership and control of manufacturing facility and greater expertise in manufacturing process more extensive relationship with local distribution company and original equipment manufacturer in emerging geographic region such china and or more established presence in certain region we derive significant portion of our consolidated revenue from small number of customer and licensee if revenue derived from these customer or licensee decrease or the timing of such revenue fluctuates our operating result could be negatively affected our qct segment derives significant portion of it revenue from small number of customer and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future our industry is experiencing and may continue to experience concentration of device share among few company particularly at the premium tier contributing to this trend in addition certain of our largest integrated circuit customer develop their own integrated circuit product which they have in the past chosen and may in the future choose to utilize in certain of their device rather than our integrated circuit product and or sell their integrated circuit product to third party in competition with also one of our largest integrated circuit customer ha begun to utilize product of one of our competitor in certain of their device rather than our product the loss of any one of our significant customer reduction in the purchase of our product by such customer or the cancelation of significant purchase from any of these customer whether due to the use of their own integrated circuit product our competitor integrated circuit product or otherwise would reduce our revenue and could harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected operating result and delay of significant purchase even if only temporary would reduce our revenue in the period of the delay further the concentration of device share among few company and the corresponding purchasing power of these company may result in lower price for our product which if not accompanied by sufficient increase in the volume of purchase of our product could have an adverse effect on our revenue and margin in addition the timing and size of purchase by our significant customer may be impacted by the timing of such customer new or next generation product introduction over which we have no control and the timing of such introduction may cause our operating result to fluctuate accordingly if current industry dynamic and concentration continue our qct segment revenue will continue to depend largely upon and be impacted by future purchase and the timing and size of any such future purchase by these significant customer one of our largest customer purchase our mobile data modem mdm product which do not include our integrated application processor technology and which have lower revenue and margin contribution than our combined modem and application processor product to the extent such customer take device share from our other customer purchase our integrated modem and application processor product our revenue and margin may be negatively impacted further company that develop hlos for device including leading technology company now sell their own device if we fail to effectively partner or continue partnering with these company or with their partner or customer they may decide not to purchase either directly or through their contract manufacturer or to reduce or discontinue their purchase of our integrated circuit product in addition there ha been and continues to be litigation among certain of our customer and other industry participant and the potential outcome of such litigation including but not limited to injunction against device that incorporate our product and or intellectual property or ruling on certain patent law or patent licensing issue that create new legal precedent could impact our business particularly if such action impact one of our larger customer although we have more than cdma based licensee our qtl segment derives significant portion of licensing revenue from limited number of licensee in the event that one or more of our significant licensee fail to meet their reporting and or payment requirement or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of such license agreement under similar term our revenue operating result and cash flow would be adversely impacted moreover the future growth and success of our core licensing business will depend in part on the ability of our licensee to develop introduce and deliver high volume product that achieve and sustain customer acceptance we have little or no control over the product development sale effort or pricing of product by our licensee and our licensee might not be successful reduction in the average selling price of wireless device sold by our major licensee without sufficient increase in the volume of such device sold would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenue we derive significant portion of our consolidated revenue from the premium tier device segment if sale of premium tier device decrease and or sale of our premium tier integrated circuit product decrease our operating result could be negatively affected we derive significant portion of our revenue from the premium tier device segment and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future we have experienced and expect to continue to experience slowing growth in the tier device segment due to among other factor lengthening replacement cycle in developed region where premium tier smartphones are common increasing consumer demand in emerging region particularly china where premium tier smartphones are le common and replacement cycle are on average longer than in developed region and or maturing premium tier smartphone industry in which demand is increasingly driven by new product launch and or innovation cycle in addition discussed in the prior risk factor our industry is experiencing concentration of device share among few company at the premium tier which give them significant supply chain leverage further those company may utilize their own internally developed integrated circuit product or our competitor integrated circuit product rather than our product in portion of their device these dynamic may result in lower price for and or reduced sale of our premium tier integrated circuit product reduction in sale of premium tier device or reduction in sale of our premium tier integrated circuit product which have higher revenue and margin contribution than our lower tier integrated circuit product may reduce our revenue and margin and may harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected operating result effort by some communication equipment manufacturer or their customer to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalty for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resource and may result in legal decision and or action by government court regulator or agency standard development organization sdos or other industry organization that harm our business from time to time company initiate various strategy to attempt to renegotiate mitigate and or eliminate their need to pay royalty to for the use of our intellectual property these strategy have included litigation often alleging infringement of patent held by such company patent misuse patent exhaustion patent invalidity and or unenforceability of our patent and or license or some form of unfair competition ii taking position contrary to our understanding of their contract with iii appeal to governmental authority iv collective action including working with wireless operator standard body other like minded company and other organization on both formal and informal base to adopt intellectual property policy and practice that could have the effect of limiting return on intellectual property innovation lobbying governmental regulator and elected official for the purpose of seeking the imposition of some form of compulsory licensing and or to weaken patent holder ability to enforce it right or obtain fair return for such right and vi licensee using various strategy to attempt to shift their royalty obligation to their supplier that result in lowering the wholesale licensee selling price on which the royalty is calculated in addition certain licensee have disputed or underreported royalty owed to under their license agreement with or reported to in manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligation and certain company have yet to enter into or delayed entering into license agreement with for their use of our intellectual property and licensee and or company may continue to do in the future further to the extent such licensee and or company increase their device share the negative impact of their underreporting and or non reporting on our business and operating result will be exacerbated we are currently subject to various litigation and governmental investigation and or proceeding some of which may arise out of the strategy described above certain legal matter are described more fully in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note commitment and contingency the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matter could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition and or cash flow depending on the type of matter various remedy that could result from an unfavorable resolution include among others injunction monetary damage or fine or other order to pay money and the issuance of order to cease certain conduct and or modify our business practice further governmental body in particular country or region may assert and may be successful in imposing remedy with effect that extend beyond the border of that country or region in addition in connection with our participation in sdos we like other patent owner generally have made contractual commitment to such organization to license those of our patent that would necessarily be infringed by standard compliant product standard essential patent on term that are fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory frand some manufacturer and user of standard compliant product advance interpretation of these frand commitment that are adverse to our licensing business including interpretation that would limit the amount of royalty that we could collect on the licensing of our patent portfolio further some company or entity have proposed significant change to existing intellectual property policy for implementation by sdos and other industry organization with the goal of significantly devaluing standard essential patent for example some have put forth proposal which would require maximum aggregate intellectual property royalty rate for the use of all standard essential patent owned by all of the member company to be applied to the selling price of any product implementing the relevant standard they have further proposed that such maximum aggregate royalty rate be apportioned to each member company with standard essential patent based upon the number of standard essential patent by such company others have proposed that injunction not be an available remedy for infringement of standard essential patent and or have made proposal that could severely limit damage award and other remedy by court for patent infringement by severely limiting the base upon which the royalty percentage may be applied number of these strategy are purportedly based on interpretation of the policy of certain sdos concerning the licensing of patent that are or may be essential to industry standard and on our and or other company alleged failure to abide by these policy some sdos court and governmental agency have adopted and may in the future adopt some or all of these interpretation or proposal in manner adverse to our interest including in litigation to which we may not be party we expect that such proposal interpretation and strategy will continue in the future and if successful our business model would be harmed either by limiting or eliminating our ability to collect royalty or by reducing the royalty we can collect on all or portion of our patent portfolio limiting our return on investment with respect to new technology limiting our ability to seek injunction against infringers of our standard essential patent constraining our ability to make licensing commitment when submitting our technology for inclusion in future standard which could make our technology le likely to be included in such standard or forcing to work outside of sdos or other industry group to promote our new technology and our result of operation could be negatively impacted in addition the legal and other cost associated with asserting or defending our position have been and continue to be significant we assume that such challenge regardless of their merit will continue into the foreseeable future and may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resource we are subject to government regulation and policy our business may suffer result of adverse ruling in government investigation or other proceeding new or changed law regulation or policy and or our failure or inability to comply with law regulation or policy our business product and service and those of our customer and licensee are subject to various law and regulation globally well government policy and the specification of international national and regional communication standard body the adoption of new law regulation or policy change in the interpretation of existing law regulation or policy change in the regulation of our activity by government or standard body and or adverse ruling in court regulatory administrative or other proceeding relating to such law regulation or policy including among others those affecting licensing practice competitive business practice the use of our technology or product protection of intellectual property trade foreign investment or loan spectrum availability and license issuance adoption of standard the provision of device subsidy by wireless operator to their customer taxation privacy and data protection environmental protection or employment could have an adverse effect on our business we are currently subject to various governmental investigation and or proceeding and certain matter are described more fully in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note commitment and contingency the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matter could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition and or cash flow depending on the type of matter various remedy that could result from an unfavorable resolution include among others injunction monetary damage or fine or other order to pay money and the issuance of order to cease certain conduct and or modify our business practice further governmental body in particular country or region may assert and may be successful in imposing remedy with effect that extend beyond the border of that country or region delay in government approval or other governmental activity that could result from among others decrease in or lack of funding for certain agency or branch of the government and or political change could result in our incurring higher cost could negatively impact our ability to timely consummate strategic transaction and or could have other negative impact on our business and the business of our customer and licensee national state and local environmental law and regulation affect our operation around the world these law may make it more expensive to manufacture have manufactured and sell product and our cost could increase if our vendor third party manufacturer or utility company pas on their cost to regulation in the united state require that we determine whether certain material used in our product referred to conflict mineral originated in the democratic republic of the congo drc or an adjoining country or were from recycled or scrap source the verification and reporting requirement in addition to customer demand for conflict free sourcing impose additional cost on and on our supplier and may limit the source or increase the price of material used in our product further if we are unable to determine that our product are drc conflict free we may face challenge with our customer that place at competitive disadvantage and our reputation may be harmed law regulation and standard relating to corporate governance business conduct public disclosure and health care are complex and changing and may create uncertainty regarding compliance law regulation and standard are subject to interpretation in many case and their application in practice may evolve over time result our effort to comply may fail particularly if there is ambiguity to they should be applied in practice new law regulation and standard or evolving interpretation of legal requirement may cause to incur higher cost we revise current practice policy and or procedure and may divert management time and attention to compliance activity the enforcement and protection of our intellectual property right may be expensive could fail to prevent misappropriation or unauthorized use of our intellectual property right could result in the loss of our ability to enforce one or more patent or could be adversely affected by change in patent law by law in certain foreign jurisdiction that may not effectively protect our intellectual property right or by ineffective enforcement of law in such jurisdiction we rely primarily on patent copyright trademark and trade secret law well nondisclosure and confidentiality agreement international treaty and other method to protect our proprietary information technology and process including our patent portfolio policing unauthorized use of our product technology and proprietary information is difficult and time consuming the step we have taken have not always prevented and we can not be certain the step we will take in the future will prevent the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary information and technology particularly in foreign country where the law may not protect our proprietary intellectual property right fully or readily united state law or where the enforcement of such law may be lacking or ineffective some industry participant who have vested interest in devaluing patent in general or standard essential patent in particular have mounted attack on certain patent system increasing the likelihood of change to established patent law in the united state there is continued discussion regarding potential patent law change and current and potential future litigation regarding patent the outcome of which could be detrimental to our licensing business the law in certain foreign country in which our product are or may be manufactured or sold including certain country in asia may not protect our intellectual property right to the same extent the law in the united state we expect that the european union will adopt unitary patent system in the next few year that may broadly impact that region patent regime we can not predict with certainty the long term effect of any potential change in addition we can not be certain that the law and policy of any country or the practice of any standard body foreign or domestic with respect to intellectual property enforcement or licensing or the adoption of standard will not be changed in the future in way detrimental to our licensing program or to the sale or use of our product or technology we have had and may in the future have difficulty in certain circumstance in protecting or enforcing our intellectual property right and or contract including collecting royalty for use of our patent portfolio in particular foreign jurisdiction due to among others policy of foreign government challenge to our licensing practice under such jurisdiction competition law adoption of mandatory licensing provision by foreign jurisdiction either with controlled regulated royalty or royalty free failure of foreign court to recognize and enforce judgment of contract breach and damage issued by court in the united state and or challenge pending foreign competition agency to the pricing and integration of additional feature and functionality into our chipset product certain licensee have disputed or underreported royalty owed to under their license agreement with or reported to in manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligation and certain company have yet to enter into or delayed entering into license agreement for their use of our intellectual property and such licensee and or company may continue to do so in the future additionally although our license agreement provide with the right to audit the book and record of licensee audit can be expensive time consuming incomplete and subject to dispute further certain licensee may not comply with the obligation to provide full access to their book and record to the extent we do not aggressively enforce our right under our license agreement licensee may not comply with their existing license agreement and to the extent we do not aggressively pursue unlicensed company to enter into license agreement with for their use of our intellectual property other unlicensed company may not enter into license agreement we have entered into litigation in the past and may need to further litigate in the future to enforce our contract and or intellectual property right protect our trade secret or determine the validity and scope of proprietary right of others result of any such litigation we could lose our ability to enforce one or more patent portion of our license agreement could be determined to be invalid or unenforceable which may in turn result in other licensee either not complying with their existing license agreement and or initiating litigation and or we could incur substantial unexpected operating cost any action we take to enforce our contract or intellectual property right could be costly and could absorb significant management time and attention which in turn could negatively impact our operating result further even positive resolution to our enforcement effort may take time to conclude which may reduce our revenue in the period prior to conclusion our growth increasingly depends on our ability to extend our product and service into new and expanded product area such rffe and adjacent industry segment outside of traditional cellular industry such the iot automotive and computing among others our research development and other investment in these new and expanded product area and industry segment and related technology product and service well in our existing technology product service and new technology such may not generate operating income or contribute to future operating result that meet our expectation our industry is subject to rapid technological change evolving industry standard and frequent new product introduction and we must make substantial research development and other investment such acquisition in new product service and technology to compete successfully technological innovation generally require significant research and development effort before they are commercially viable while we continue to invest significant resource toward advancement primarily in support of ofdma and based technology we also innovate across broad spectrum of opportunity to deploy new and expanded product and enter into adjacent industry segment by leveraging our existing technical and business expertise and or through acquisition in particular our future growth significantly depends on new and expanded product area such rffe and adjacent industry segment such automotive iot including the connected home smart city and wearable data center networking mobile computing mobile health and machine learning including robotics among others our ability to develop leading and cost effective technology product and service for new and expanded product area and adjacent industry segment and third party incorporating our technology product and service into device type used in these product area and industry segment accordingly we intend to continue to make substantial investment in these new and expanded product area and adjacent industry segment and in developing new product service and technology for these product area and industry segment however our research development and other investment in these new and expanded product area and adjacent industry segment and corresponding technology product and service well in our existing technology product and service and new technology such use of both licensed and unlicensed spectrum convergence of cellular and wi fi and may not succeed due to among others new industry segment and or consumer demand may not grow anticipated our strategy and or the strategy of our customer licensee or partner may not be successful improvement in alternate technology in way that reduce the advantage we anticipate from our investment competitor product or service being more cost effective more capability or fewer limitation or being brought to market faster than our new product and service and competitor having longer operating history in industry segment that are new to we may also underestimate the cost of or overestimate the future operating income and or margin that could result from these investment and these investment may not or may take many year to generate material return if our new technology product and or service are not successful or are not successful in the time frame we anticipate we may incur significant cost and or asset impairment our business may not grow anticipated our revenue and or margin may be negatively impacted and or our reputation may be harmed the continued and future success of our licensing program can be impacted by the deployment of other technology in place of technology based on cdma ofdma and their derivative the success of our licensing program for single mode product and emerging industry segment and the need to extend license agreement that are expiring and or to cover additional future patent although we own very strong portfolio of issued and pending patent related to gsm gprs edge ofdm ofdma wlan and other technology our patent portfolio licensing program in these area is le established and might not be successful in generating licensing revenue our cdma licensing program ha been many wireless operator are investigating have selected or have deployed ofdma based lte their next generation technology in existing or future if not yet deployed wireless spectrum band complementary to their existing cdma based network while multimode product are generally covered by our existing licensing agreement product that implement but do not also implement are generally not covered by these agreement although we believe that our patented technology is essential and useful to implementation of the lte industry standard and have granted royalty bearing license to more than company including huawei lenovo lg microsoft oppo samsung sony mobile vivo xiaomi and zte that have realized that they need license to our patent to make and sell product implementing standard but not implementing standard it may be difficult to agree on material term and or condition of new license agreement that are acceptable to with company that are currently unlicensed further the royalty rate for single mode product are lower than our royalty rate for and multimode product so without corresponding increase in volume and or device asp we will not achieve the same licensing revenue on such lte product on and multimode product in addition new connectivity and other service are emerging that rely on device that may or may not be used on traditional cellular network such device used in the connected home or the iot we also seek to diversify and broaden our technology licensing program to new industry segment in which we can utilize our technology leadership such wireless charging and other technology standard even de facto standard that develop these technology mature in particular those that do not include base level of interoperability may impact our ability to obtain royalty that are equivalent to those that we receive for and multimode product used in cellular communication although we believe that our patented is essential and useful to the commercialization of such service the royalty we receive may be lower than those we receive from our current licensing program over the long term we need to continue to evolve our patent portfolio if we do not maintain strong portfolio that is applicable to current and or future standard such product and or service our future licensing revenue could be negatively impacted the license granted to and from under number of our license agreement include only patent that are either filed or issued prior to certain date and in small number of agreement royalty are payable on those patent for specified time period result there are agreement with some licensee where later patent are not licensed by or to and or royalty are not owed to under such license agreement after the specified time period additionally certain of our license agreement including essentially all of our recent agreement in china are effective for specified term in order to license or to obtain license to such later patent or after the expiration of specified term or to receive royalty after the specified time period we will need to extend or modify such license agreement or enter into new license agreement with such licensee accordingly to the extent not renewed on their term or by election for an additional generally multi year period if applicable we will need to extend or modify such license agreement or enter into new license agreement with such licensee more frequently than we have done historically we might not be able to renew those license agreement or enter into new license agreement in the future without affecting the material term and condition of our license agreement with such licensee and such modification or new agreement may negatively impact our revenue if there is delay in renewing license agreement prior to it expiration there would be delay in our ability to recognize revenue related to that licensee product sale further if we are unable to reach agreement on such modification or new agreement it could result in patent infringement litigation with such company we depend on limited number of third party supplier for the procurement manufacture and testing of our product if we fail to execute supply strategy that provide technology leadership supply assurance and low cost our operating result and our business may be harmed we are also subject to order and shipment uncertainty that could negatively impact our operating result our qct segment currently utilizes fable production model which mean that we do not own or operate foundry for the production of silicon wafer from which our integrated circuit are made we employ both turnkey and two stage manufacturing model to purchase our integrated circuit under the turnkey model our foundry supplier are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuit under the two stage manufacturing model we purchase die in singular or wafer form from semiconductor manufacturing foundry and contract with separate third party supplier for manufacturing service such wafer bump probe assembly and final test the semiconductor manufacturing foundry that supply product to our qct segment are primarily located in asia are our primary warehouse where we store finished good for fulfillment of customer order the following could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand and or negatively impact our revenue business operation profitability and or cash flow reduction interruption delay or limitation in our product supply source failure by our supplier to procure raw material or to provide or allocate adequate manufacturing or test capacity for our product our supplier inability to react to shift in product demand or an increase in raw material or component price our supplier delay in developing leading process technology or inability to develop or maintain leading process technology including transition to smaller geometry process technology the loss of supplier or the inability of supplier to meet performance quality or yield specification or delivery schedule and or additional expense and or production delay result of qualifying new supplier and commencing volume production or testing in the event of loss of or decision to add or change supplier while we have established alternate supplier for certain technology we rely on sole or limited source supplier for certain product subjecting to significant risk including possible shortage of raw material or manufacturing capacity poor product performance and reduced control over delivery schedule manufacturing capability and yield quality assurance quantity and cost to the extent we have established alternate supplier these supplier may require significant level of support to bring complex technology to production result we may invest significant amount of effort and resource and incur higher cost to support and maintain such alternate supplier further any future consolidation of foundry supplier could increase our vulnerability to sole or limited source arrangement and reduce our supplier willingness to negotiate pricing which could negatively impact our ability to achieve cost reduction and or increase our manufacturing our arrangement with our supplier may obligate to incur cost to manufacture and test our product that do not decrease at the same rate decrease in pricing to our customer our ability and that of our supplier to develop or maintain leading process technology including transition to smaller geometry process technology and to effectively compete with the manufacturing process and performance of our competitor could impact our ability to introduce new product and meet customer demand could increase our cost possibly decreasing our margin and could subject to the risk of excess inventory our inability to meet customer demand due to sole or limited sourcing and or the additional cost that we incur because of these or other supply constraint or because of the need to support alternate supplier could negatively impact our business and our result of operation although we have long term contract with our supplier many of these contract do not provide for long term capacity commitment to the extent we do not have firm commitment from our supplier over specific time period or for any specific quantity our supplier may allocate and in the past have allocated capacity to the production and testing of product for their other customer while reducing or limiting capacity to manufacture or test our product accordingly capacity for our product may not be available when we need it or at reasonable price to the extent we do obtain long term capacity commitment we may incur additional cost related to those commitment and or make non refundable payment for capacity commitment that are not used one or more of our supplier or potential alternate supplier may manufacture cdma or ofdma based integrated circuit that compete with our product in this event the supplier could elect to allocate raw material and manufacturing capacity to their own product and reduce or limit delivery to to our detriment in addition we may not receive reasonable pricing manufacturing or delivery term we can not guarantee that the action of our supplier will not cause disruption in our operation that could harm our ability to meet our delivery obligation to our customer or increase our cost of sale additionally we place order with our supplier using our forecast of customer demand which are based on number of assumption and estimate and are generally only partially covered by commitment from our customer if we overestimate customer demand we may experience increased excess and or obsolete inventory which would negatively impact our operating result claim by other company that we infringe their intellectual property could adversely affect our business from time to time company have asserted and may assert patent copyright and other intellectual property right against our product or product using our technology or other technology used in our industry these claim have resulted and may again result in our involvement in litigation we may not prevail in such litigation given among other factor the complex technical issue and inherent uncertainty in intellectual property litigation if any of our product or service were found to infringe another company intellectual property right we could be subject to an injunction or be required to redesign our product or service which could be costly or to license such right and or pay damage or other compensation to such other company if we are unable to redesign our product or service license such intellectual property right used in our product or service or otherwise distribute our product through licensed supplier we could be prohibited from making and selling such product or providing such service in any potential dispute involving other company patent or other intellectual property our chipset foundry semiconductor assembly and test provider and customer could also become the target of litigation we are contingently liable under certain product sale service license and other agreement to indemnify certain customer against certain type of liability and or damage arising from qualifying claim of patent infringement by product or service sold or provided by reimbursement under indemnification arrangement could have an adverse effect on our result of operation furthermore any such litigation could severely disrupt the supply of our product and the business of our chipset customer and their customer which in turn could hurt our relationship with them and could result in decline in our chipset sale and or reduction in our licensee sale causing corresponding decline in our chipset and or licensing revenue any claim regardless of their merit could be time consuming to address result in costly litigation divert the effort of our technical and management personnel or cause product release or shipment delay any of which could have an adverse effect on our operating result we expect that we may continue to be involved in litigation and may have to appear in front of administrative body such the united state international trade commission to defend against patent assertion against our product by company some of are attempting to gain competitive advantage or leverage in licensing negotiation we may not be successful in such proceeding and if we are not the range of possible outcome is very broad and may include for example monetary damage or fine or other order to pay money royalty payment injunction on the sale of certain of our integrated circuit product and or on the sale of our customer device using such product and or the issuance of order to cease certain conduct and or modify our business practice further governmental body in particular country or region may assert and may be successful in imposing remedy with effect that extend beyond the border of that country or region in addition negative outcome in any such proceeding could severely disrupt the business of our chipset customer their wireless operator customer which in turn could harm our relationship with them and could result in decline in our worldwide chipset sale and or reduction in our licensee sale to wireless operator causing corresponding decline in our chipset and or licensing revenue certain legal matter including certain claim by other company that we infringe their intellectual property are described more fully in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note commitment and contingency we may engage in strategic acquisition transaction or make investment that could adversely affect our financial result or fail to enhance stockholder value we engage in strategic acquisition and other transaction including joint venture and make investment which we believe are important to the future of our business with the goal of maximizing stockholder value we acquire business and other asset including patent technology wireless spectrum and other intangible asset enter into joint venture or other strategic transaction and purchase minority equity interest in or make loan to company that may be private and early stage our strategic activity are generally focused on opening new or expanding opportunity for our technology and supporting the design and introduction of new product and service or enhancing existing product or service for voice and data communication and new industry segment recent material transaction include our acquisition of csr plc our pending joint venture with tdk corporation and our proposed acquisition of nxp many of our strategic activity entail high degree of risk and require the use of domestic and or foreign capital and investment may not become liquid for several year after the date of the investment if at all our strategic activity may not generate financial return or result in increased adoption or continued use of our technology product or service in some case we may be required to consolidate or record our share of the earnings or loss of company in which we have acquired ownership interest in addition we may record impairment charge related to our strategic activity any loss or impairment charge that we incur related to strategic activity will have negative impact on our financial result and we may continue to incur new or additional loss related to strategic asset or investment that we have not fully impaired or exited we may underestimate the cost and or overestimate the benefit including product and other synergy and growth opportunity that we expect to realize and we may not achieve them if we do not achieve the anticipated benefit of business acquisition or other strategic activity our result of operation may be adversely affected and we may not enhance stockholder value by engaging in these transaction achieving the anticipated benefit of business acquisition including joint venture and other strategic investment in which we have management and operational control depends in part upon our ability to integrate the business in an efficient and effective manner and achieve anticipated synergy such integration is complex and time consuming and involves significant challenge including among others retaining key employee successfully integrating new employee technology product process operation including manufacturing operation sale and distribution channel business model and business system retaining customer and supplier of the business consolidating research and development and or supply operation minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business matter and consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructure and managing the increased scale complexity and globalization of our business operation and employee base we may not derive any commercial value from associated technology or product or from future technology or product based on these technology and we may be subject to liability that are not covered by indemnification protection that we may obtain or we may become subject to litigation additionally we may not be successful in entering or expanding into new sale or distribution channel business or operational model including manufacturing geographic region industry segment and or category of product served by or adjacent to the associated business or in addressing potential new opportunity that may arise out of the combination our use of open source software may harm our business certain of our software and our supplier software may contain or may be derived from open source software and we have seen and believe we will continue to see an increase in customer requesting that we develop product including software associated with our integrated circuit product that incorporate open source software element and operate in an open source environment which under certain open source license may offer accessibility to portion of product source code and may expose related intellectual property to adverse licensing condition licensing of such software may impose certain obligation on if we were to distribute derivative work of the open source software for example these obligation may require to make source code for the derivative work available to our customer in manner that allows them to make such source code available to their customer or license such derivative work under particular type of license that is different than what we customarily use to license our software developing open source product while adequately protecting the intellectual property right upon which our licensing business depends may prove burdensome and time consuming under certain circumstance thereby placing at competitive disadvantage also our use and our customer use of open source software may subject our product and our customer product to governmental scrutiny and delay in product certification which could cause customer to view our product le desirable than our competitor product we believe we have taken appropriate step and employ adequate control to protect our intellectual property right our use of open source software present risk that could have an adverse effect on these right and on our business our stock price earnings and the fair value of our investment are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuation and to market downturn our stock price and earnings have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future factor that may have significant impact on the market price of our stock and or earnings include those identified throughout this risk factor section volatility of the stock market in general and technology based company in particular announcement concerning our supplier our competitor or our customer or licensee and variation between our actual result or guidance and expectation of security analyst among others further increased volatility in the financial market and or overall economic condition may reduce the amount that we realize in the future on our cash equivalent and or marketable security and may reduce our earnings result of any impairment charge that we record to reduce recorded value of marketable security to their fair value in the past security class action litigation ha been brought against company following period of volatility in the market price of it security due to change in our stock price we are and may in the future be the target of security litigation security litigation could result in substantial uninsured cost and divert management attention and our resource certain legal matter including certain security litigation brought against are described more fully in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note commitment and contingency we maintain an extensive investment portfolio of varied holding which are generally classified available for sale and are therefore recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gain or loss reported component of accumulated other comprehensive income the fair value of our investment are subject to fluctuation based primarily on market price volatility well the underlying operation of the associated investment among other thing if the fair value of such investment decrease below their cost basis some of our previous investment have we may be required in certain circumstance to recognize loss in our result of operation the sensitivity of and risk associated with the market value of our investment portfolio are described more fully in this annual report in part ii item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk there are risk associated with our indebtedness our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur including in connection with our proposed acquisition of nxp may have negative consequence on our business including among others requiring to use cash to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness thereby reducing the amount of cash available for other purpose limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditure acquisition stock repurchase dividend or other general corporate and other purpose limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to change in our business and our industry and or increasing our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuation to the extent portion of our debt ha variable interest rate our ability to make payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance which is subject to general economic condition industry cycle and financial business and other factor many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operation in the future to service our debt we may be required to among other thing repatriate fund to the united state at substantial tax cost refinance or restructure all or portion of our indebtedness reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditure or sell selected asset such measure might not be sufficient to enable to service our debt in addition any such refinancing restructuring or sale of asset might not be available on economically favorable term or at all and if prevailing interest rate at the time of any such refinancing and or restructuring are higher than our current rate interest expense related to such refinancing and or restructuring would increase if there are adverse change in the rating assigned to our debt security by credit rating agency our borrowing cost our ability to access debt in the future and or the term of such debt could be adversely affected global regional or local economic condition that impact the mobile communication industry or the other industry in which we operate could negatively affect the demand for our product and service and our customer or licensee product and service which may negatively affect our revenue decline in global regional or local economic condition or slow down in economic growth particularly in geographic region with high concentration of wireless voice and data user or high concentration of our customer or could have adverse wide ranging effect on demand for our product and for the product and service of our customer or licensee particularly equipment manufacturer or others in the wireless communication industry who buy their product such wireless operator any prolonged economic downturn may result in decrease in demand for our product or technology the insolvency of key supplier customer or licensee delay in reporting and or payment from our licensee and or customer failure by counterparties and negative effect on wireless device inventory in addition our customer ability to purchase or pay for our product and service and network operator ability to upgrade their wireless network could be adversely affected by economic condition leading to reduction cancelation or delay of order for our product or service we may not be able to attract and retain qualified employee our future success depends largely upon the continued service of our executive officer and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to identify attract retain and motivate them particularly in an environment of cost reduction implementing our business strategy requires specialized engineering and other talent our revenue are highly dependent on technological and product innovation the market for employee in our industry is extremely competitive further existing immigration law make it more difficult for to recruit and retain highly skilled foreign national graduate of university in the united state making the pool of available talent even smaller if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employee our business may be harmed currency fluctuation could negatively affect future product sale or royalty revenue harm our ability to collect receivables or increase the dollar cost of our product our customer sell their product throughout the world in various currency our consolidated revenue from international customer percentage of our total revenue were greater than during each of the last three fiscal year adverse movement in currency exchange rate may negatively affect our business and our operating result due to number of factor including among others our product and those of our customer and licensee that are sold outside the united state may become le price competitive which may result in reduced demand for those product and or downward pressure on average selling price certain of our revenue such royalty that are derived from licensee or customer sale denominated in foreign currency could decrease our foreign supplier may raise their price if they are impacted by currency fluctuation resulting in higher than expected cost and lower margin and or foreign exchange hedging transaction that we engage in to reduce the impact of currency fluctuation may require the payment of structuring fee limit the dollar value of royalty from licensee sale that are denominated in foreign currency cause earnings volatility if the hedge do not qualify for hedge accounting and expose to counterparty risk if the counterparty fails to perform failure in our product or service or in the product or service of our customer or licensee including those resulting from security vulnerability defect or error could harm our business the use of device containing our product to access untrusted content creates risk of exposing the system software in those device to viral or malicious attack while we continue to focus on this issue and are taking measure to safeguard our product from cybersecurity threat device capability continue to evolve enabling more data and process such mobile computing and increasing the risk of security failure further our product are inherently complex and may contain defect or error that are detected only when the product are in use the design process interface in new domain of technology and the migration to integrated circuit technology with smaller geometric feature size are complex and add risk to manufacturing yield and reliability further manufacturing testing marketing and use of our product and those of our customer and licensee entail the risk of product liability because our product and service are responsible for critical function in our customer product and or network security failure defect or error in our product or service could have an adverse impact on on our customer and or on the end user of our customer product such adverse impact could include product liability claim or recall write offs of our inventory and or intangible asset unfavorable purchase commitment shift of business to our competitor decrease in demand for connected device and wireless service damage to our reputation and to our customer relationship and other financial liability or harm to our business further security failure defect or error in the product of our customer or licensee such the recent issue with the galaxy note that caused samsung to discontinue that product could have an adverse impact on our operating result due to delay or decrease in demand for our product or service generally and our premium tier product in particular among other factor business and operation could suffer in the event of security breach attempt by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology system are increasingly more sophisticated these attempt which might be related to industrial or other espionage include covertly introducing malware to our computer and network and impersonating authorized user among others we seek to detect and investigate all security incident and to prevent their recurrence but in some case we might be unaware of an incident or it magnitude and effect while we have identified several incident of unauthorized access to date none have caused material damage to our business the theft unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and or confidential business information could harm our competitive position reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiative and or otherwise adversely affect our business to

cdma ofdma multimode continued around the world connection increased to approximately billion up year over year and represent approximately of total mobile connection up from at the end of fiscal revenue were billion decrease of compared to fiscal with net income attributable to qualcomm of billion an increase of compared to fiscal qct segment we shipped approximately million mobile station modem msm integrated circuit for cdma and ofdma based wireless device decrease of compared to approximately million msm integrated circuit in fiscal qct revenue decreased by and it earnings before tax percentage of revenue decreased to from in fiscal primarily due to the effect of shift in share among our customer within the premium tier which reduced our sale of integrated snapdragon processor and skewed our product mix towards lower margin modem chipsets in this tier decline in share at our large customer and the competitive environment in china partially offset by lower product cost including lower excess inventory charge and the impact of the acquisition of csr in the fourth quarter of fiscal qtl segment total reported device sale by licensee were approximately billion in fiscal an increase of approximately compared to approximately billion in fiscal however despite the increase in total reported device sale qtl revenue decreased by compared to fiscal primarily due to decrease in revenue per reported unit and recognition of unearned license fee partially offset by an increase in reported sale of cdma based product including multimode product that also implement ofdma and million in licensing revenue recorded in the second quarter of fiscal due to the termination of an infrastructure license agreement resulting from the merger of two licensee qtl revenue and ebt in fiscal continued to be impacted negatively by unit that we believe are not being reported by certain licensee and sale of certain unlicensed product strategic realignment plan in the fourth quarter of

including transportation insurance packing cost and other item while other licensee report sale and then identify the amount of permitted deduction in their report and the way in which licensee report such information may change from time to time in addition certain licensee may not report in the quarter in which they are contractually obligated to report their sale of certain type of subscriber

component to interface with the integrated circuit product and is the foundation software enabling manufacturer to develop device utilizing the functionality within the integrated circuit qct revenue comprised and of our total consolidated revenue in fiscal and respectively qct currently utilizes fable production model which mean that we do not own or operate foundry for the production of silicon wafer from which our integrated circuit are made integrated circuit are die cut from silicon wafer that have completed the package assembly and test manufacturing process we rely on independent third party supplier to perform the manufacturing and assembly and most of the testing of our integrated circuit based primarily on our proprietary design and test program our supplier are also responsible for the procurement of most of the raw material used in the production of our integrated circuit we employ both turnkey and two stage manufacturing model to purchase our integrated circuit turnkey is when our foundry supplier are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuit under the two stage manufacturing model we purchase die in singular or wafer form from semiconductor manufacturing foundry and contract with separate third party supplier for manufacturing service such wafer bump probe assembly and final test qtl grant license or otherwise provides

qsi make strategic investment that are focused on opening new or expanding opportunity for our technology and supporting the design and introduction of new product and service or enhancing existing product or service for voice and data communication many of these strategic investment are in early stage company in variety of industry including but not limited to digital medium commerce healthcare and wearable device investment primarily include non equity instrument which generally are recorded using the cost method or the equity method and convertible debt instrument which are recorded at fair value qsi also held wireless spectrum which wa sold in the first quarter of fiscal for gain of approximately million in addition qsi segment result include revenue and related cost associated with development contract with one of our equity method investees part of our strategic investment activity we intend to pursue various exit strategy for each of our qsi investment in the foreseeable future nonreportable segment include our mobile heath data center small cell and other wireless technology and service initiative seasonality many of our product or intellectual property are incorporated into consumer wireless device which are subject to seasonality and other fluctuation in demand result qct ha tended historically to have stronger sale toward the end of the calendar year manufacturer prepare for major holiday selling season and because qtl recognizes royalty revenue when royalty are reported by licensee qtl ha tended to record higher royalty revenue in the first calendar quarter when licensee report their sale made during the fourth calendar quarter we have also experienced fluctuation in revenue due to the timing of conversion and expansion of and network by wireless operator and the timing of launch of flagship wireless device that incorporate our product and or intellectual property these trend may or may not continue in the future looking forwardwe expect continued growth in the coming year in consumer demand for multimode and product and service around the world driven primarily by smartphones we also expect growth in new device category and industry driven by the expanding adoption of certain technology that are already commonly used in smartphones we look forward to the next several month we expect our business to be impacted by the following key item on october we announced definitive agreement under which qualcomm river holding an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of qualcomm incorporated will acquire nxp semiconductor pursuant to the definitive agreement qualcomm river holding will commence tender offer to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common share of nxp for per share in cash for estimated total cash consideration of billion nxp is leader in high performance mixed signal semiconductor electronics in automotive broad based microcontrollers secure identification network processing and rf power product the transaction is expected to close by the end of calendar and is subject to receipt of regulatory approval in various jurisdiction and other closing condition including the tender of specified percentage which vary from to based on certain circumstance provided in the definitive agreement of the issued and outstanding common share of nxp in the offer the tender offer is not subject to any financing condition however we intend to fund the transaction with cash held by foreign entity and new debt we expect that this will require to devote significant resource and management time and attention prior to close take on significant debt and utilize substantial portion of our cash cash equivalent and marketable security consumer demand for smartphone product is increasing in emerging region particularly in china driven by availability of lower tier device we expect the ongoing rollout of service in emerging region will encourage competition and growth bringing the benefit of lte multimode to consumer our business particularly qct expects to continue to be impacted by industry dynamic including concentration of device share among few company within the premium tier resulting in significant supply chain leverage for those company decision by company to utilize their own internally developed integrated circuit product or our competitor integrated circuit product in portion of their device intense competition particularly in china our competitor expand their product offering and or reduce the price of their product part of strategy to attract new and or retain customer and lengthening replacement cycle in developed region where the smartphone industry is mature premium tier smartphones are common and consumer demand is increasingly driven by new product launch and or innovation cycle and from increasing consumer demand in emerging region where premium tier smartphones are le common and replacement cycle are on average longer than in developed region we continue to believe that certain licensee particularly in china are not fully complying with their contractual obligation to report their sale of licensed product to and certain company including unlicensed company are delaying execution of new license agreement while we have made substantial progress in reaching agreement many company negotiation with certain licensee and unlicensed company are ongoing we believe that the conclusion of new agreement with these company will result in improved reporting by these licensee including with respect to sale of three mode device device that implement gsm td scdma and lte tdd sold in china additionally we believe our increased effort in the area of compliance will also improve reporting but will also result in increased cost to the business litigation and or other action such the litigation against meizu technology co ltd described in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note commitment and contingency may be necessary to compel licensee to report and pay the required royalty for sale they have not previously reported and or to compel unlicensed company to execute license regulatory authority in other jurisdiction continue to investigate our business practice an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matter could have material adverse effect on our business with remedy that include among others injunction monetary damage or fine or other order to pay money and the issuance of order to cease certain conduct and or modify our business practice see note to consolidated financial statement note commitment and contingency elsewhere in this annual report we continue to invest significant resource toward advancement in lte and technology ofdm based wlan technology wireless baseband chip our converged computing communication snapdragon chip radio frequency front end rffe connectivity graphic audio and video codecs multimedia product software and service which contribute to the expansion of our intellectual property portfolio we are also investing in targeted opportunity that leverage our existing technical and business expertise to deploy new business model and enter into new industry segment such product for automotive the internet of thing iot including the connected home smart city and wearable data center networking mobile computing mobile health and machine learning including robotics among others in january we announced that we had reached an agreement with tdk corporation to form joint venture under the name holding singapore pte ltd to enable delivery of rffe module and rf filter into fully integrated product for mobile device and iot application among others the joint venture will initially be owned by and by tdk certain intellectual property patent and filter and module design and manufacturing asset will be carved out of existing tdk business and be acquired by the joint venture with certain asset acquired by the purchase price of our interest in the joint venture and the asset to be transferred to is billion to be adjusted for working capital outstanding indebtedness and certain capital expenditure among other thing additionally we have the option to acquire and tdk ha an option to sell tdk interest in the joint venture for billion month after the closing date tdk will be entitled to up to total of million in payment based on sale of rf filter function over the three year period after the closing date which is substitute for and in lieu of any right of tdk to receive any profit sharing distribution dividend or other payment of any kind or nature the transaction is subject to receipt of regulatory approval and other closing condition and is expected to close in early calendar in addition to the foregoing business and market based matter we continue to devote resource to working with and educating participant in the wireless value chain and government to the benefit of our business model and our extensive technology investment in promoting highly competitive and innovative wireless industry however we expect that certain company may continue to be dissatisfied with the need to pay reasonable royalty for the use of our technology and not welcome the success of our business model in enabling new highly cost effective competitor to their product we expect that such company and or government or regulator will continue to challenge our business model in various forum throughout the world further discussion of risk related to our business is presented in the risk factor included in this annual report critical accounting estimatesthe preparation of our consolidated financial statement in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state requires to make estimate and judgment that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense and disclosure of contingent asset and liability we base our estimate on historical and anticipated result and trend and on various other assumption that we believe are reasonable under the circumstance including assumption to future event by their nature estimate are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty although we believe that our estimate and the assumption supporting our assessment are reasonable actual result that differ from our estimate could be material to our consolidated financial statement summary of our significant accounting policy is included in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note the company and it significant accounting policy we consider the following accounting estimate to be critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statement of marketable security and other investment we hold investment in marketable security with increase and decrease in fair value generally recorded through stockholder equity other comprehensive income or loss we record impairment loss in earnings when we believe an investment ha experienced decline that is other than temporary the determination that decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factor adverse change in market condition or poor operating result of investees could result in loss or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment thereby requiring recognition of impairment loss when assessing these investment for an other than temporary decline in value we consider such factor among other thing the significance of the decline in value compared to the cost basis underlying factor contributing to decline in the price of security in single asset class how long the market value of the security ha been le than it cost basis the security relative performance versus it peer sector or asset class expected market volatility the market and economy in general analyst recommendation and price target view of external investment manager news or financial information that ha been released specific to the investee and the outlook for the overall industry in which the investee operates applicable during fiscal and we recorded million million and million respectively in impairment loss on our investment in marketable security of september we had gross unrealized loss of million prior to closing the nxp transaction we expect to divest substantial portion of our marketable security portfolio in order to finance our proposed acquisition which may result in loss in our result of operation we also hold investment in non marketable equity instrument in privately held company that are accounted for using either the cost or the equity method many of these investment are in early stage company which are inherently risky because the market for the technology or product of these company are uncertain and may never develop we monitor our investment for event or circumstance that could indicate the investment are impaired such deterioration in the investee financial condition and business forecast and lower valuation in recently completed or proposed financing and we record impairment loss in earnings when we believe an investment ha experienced decline in value that is other than temporary valuation of inventory inventory are valued at the lower of cost or market replacement cost not to exceed net realizable value using the first in first out method recoverability of inventory is assessed based on review of future customer demand that considers multiple factor including committed purchase order from customer well purchase commitment projection provided by customer among other thing this valuation also requires to make judgment and assumption based on information currently available about market condition including competition product pricing product life cycle and development plan if we overestimate demand for our product the amount of our loss will be impacted by our contractual ability to reduce inventory purchase from our supplier our assumption of future product demand are inherently uncertain and change in our estimate and assumption may cause to realize material write down in the future valuation of goodwill and other indefinite lived and long lived asset our business acquisition typically result in the recording of goodwill other intangible asset and property plant and equipment and the recorded value of those asset may become impaired in the future we also acquire intangible asset and property plant and equipment in other type of transaction the determination of the recorded value of intangible asset acquired in business combination requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect our consolidated financial statement for intangible asset acquired in non monetary exchange the estimated fair value of the asset transferred or the estimated fair value of the asset received if more clearly evident are used to establish their recorded value unless the value of neither the asset received nor the asset transferred are determinable within reasonable limit in which case the asset received are measured based on the carrying value of the asset transferred valuation technique consistent with the market approach income approach and or cost approach are used to measure fair value an estimate of fair value can be affected by many assumption that require significant judgment for example the income approach generally requires to use assumption to estimate future cash flow including those related to total addressable market pricing and share forecast competition technology obsolescence future tax rate and discount rate our estimate of the fair value of certain asset may differ materially from that determined by others who use different assumption or utilize different business model goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset are tested annually for impairment and in interim period if certain event occur indicating that the carrying amount may be impaired long lived asset such property plant and equipment and intangible asset subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence that event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicator and future cash flow related to goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset and long lived asset may be based on operational performance of our business market condition expected selling price and or other factor although there are inherent uncertainty in this assessment process the estimate and assumption we use including estimate of future cash flow and discount rate are consistent with our internal planning when appropriate if these estimate or their related assumption change in the future we may be required to record an impairment charge on or all of our goodwill other indefinite lived intangible asset and or long lived asset furthermore we can not predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering event nor the impact such event might have on our reported asset value future event could cause to conclude that impairment indicator exist and that goodwill or other intangible asset associated with our acquired business are impaired any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our financial position and result of operation during fiscal and we recorded million million and million respectively in impairment charge for goodwill other indefinite lived intangible asset and long lived asset the estimated fair value of our qct and qtl reporting unit were substantially in excess of their respective carrying value at september legal proceeding we are currently involved in certain legal proceeding and we intend to continue to vigorously defend however the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceeding could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition and or cash flow broad range of remedy with respect to our business practice that are deemed to violate applicable law are potentially available these remedy may include among others injunction monetary damage or fine or other order to pay money and the issuance of order to cease certain conduct and or to modify our business practice we disclose loss contingency if there is at least reasonable possibility that material loss ha been incurred we record our best estimate of loss related to pending legal proceeding when the loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated where range of loss can be reasonably estimated with no best estimate in the range we record the minimum estimated liability additional information becomes available we ass the potential liability including the probability of loss related to pending legal proceeding and revise our estimate and update our disclosure accordingly significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination to whether loss is reasonably estimable revision in our estimate of the potential liability could materially impact our result of operation income tax we are subject to income tax in the united state and numerous foreign jurisdiction and the assessment of our income tax position involves dealing with uncertainty in the application of complex tax law and regulation in various taxing jurisdiction in addition the application of tax law and regulation is subject to legal and factual interpretation judgment and uncertainty tax law and regulation are subject to change result of change in fiscal policy change in legislation the evolution of regulation and court ruling significant judgment and estimate are required in determining our provision for income tax including those related to tax incentive intercompany research and development cost sharing arrangement transfer pricing and tax credit while we believe we have appropriate support for the position taken on our tax return we regularly ass the potential outcome of examination by taxing authority in determining the adequacy of our provision for income tax therefore the actual liability for united state or foreign tax may be materially different from our estimate which could result in the need to record additional tax liability or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liability we are participating in the internal revenue service irs compliance assurance process program whereby we endeavor to agree with the irs on the treatment of all issue prior to filing our federal return benefit of participation in this program is that post filing adjustment by the irs are le likely to occur our qct segment non united state headquarters is located in singapore we obtained tax incentive in singapore that commenced in march including tax exemption for the first five year provided that we meet specified employment and incentive criterion and result of the expiration of these incentive our singapore tax rate is expected to increase in fiscal and again in fiscal our failure to meet these criterion could adversely impact our provision for income tax we consider the operating earnings of certain non united state subsidiary to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united state based on our plan for use and or investment outside of the united state and our belief that our source of cash and liquidity in the united state will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash need on regular basis we consider projected cash need for among other thing potential acquisition such our proposed acquisition of nxp investment in our existing business future research and development and capital transaction including repurchase of our common stock dividend and debt repayment we estimate the amount of cash or other liquidity that is available or needed in the jurisdiction where these investment are expected well our ability to generate cash in those jurisdiction and our access to capital market this analysis enables to conclude whether or not we will indefinitely reinvest the current period foreign earnings we have not recorded deferred tax liability of approximately billion related to the united state federal and state income tax and foreign withholding tax on approximately billion of undistributed earnings of certain non united state subsidiary indefinitely reinvested outside the united state should we decide to no longer indefinitely reinvest such earnings outside the united state for example if we determine that such earnings are needed to fund future domestic operation or there is not sufficient need for such earnings outside of the united state we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we make such determination of operationsrevenues in million change changeequipment and service the decrease in equipment and service revenue in fiscal and were primarily due to decrease in qct revenue of billion and billion

transfer liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participant of the measurement date applicable accounting guidance provides an established hierarchy for input used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable input and minimizes the use of unobservable input by requiring that the most observable input be used when available observable input are input that incorporatednotes to consolidated financial statementsmarket participant would use in valuing the asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from source independent of the company unobservable input are input that reflect the company assumption about the factor that market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability there are three level of input that may be used to measure fair value level includes financial instrument for which quoted market price for identical instrument are available in active market level includes financial instrument for which there are input other than quoted price included within level that are observable for the instrument level includes financial instrument for which fair value is derived from valuation technique in which one or more significant input are unobservable including the company own assumption asset and liability are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the company review the fair value hierarchy classification on quarterly basis change in the observability of valuation input may result in reclassification of level for certain security within the fair value hierarchy cash equivalent and marketable security with the exception of auction rate security the company obtains pricing information from quoted market price pricing vendor or quote from broker dealer the company conduct review of it primary pricing vendor to determine whether the input used in the vendor pricing process are deemed to be observable the fair value for interest bearing security includes accrued interest the fair value of treasury security and government related security corporate bond and note and common and preferred stock is generally determined using standard observable input including reported trade quoted market price matrix pricing benchmark yield broker dealer quote issuer spread two sided market and or benchmark security the fair value of debt and equity fund is reported at published net asset value the company ass the daily frequency and size of transaction at published net asset value and or the fund underlying holding to determine whether fair value is based on observable or unobservable input the fair value of mortgage and asset backed security is derived from the use of matrix pricing price for similar security or in some case cash flow pricing model with observable input such contractual term maturity credit rating and or securitization structure to determine the timing and amount of future cash flow certain mortgage and asset backed security may require the use of significant unobservable input to estimate fair value such default likelihood recovery rate and prepayment speed the fair value of auction rate security is estimated by the company using discounted cash flow model that incorporates transaction detail such contractual term maturity and timing and amount of future cash flow well assumption related to liquidity default likelihood and recovery the future state of the auction rate market and credit valuation adjustment of market participant though most of the security held by the company are pool of student loan guaranteed by the government prepayment speed and illiquidity discount are considered significant unobservable input these additional input are generally unobservable and therefore auction rate security are included in level derivative instrument derivative instrument that are traded on an exchange are valued using quoted market price and are included in level derivative instrument that are not traded on an exchange are valued using conventional calculation model that are primarily based on observable input such foreign currency exchange rate volatility and interest rate and therefore such derivative instrument are included in level other investment and other liability other investment and other liability included in level are comprised of the company deferred compensation plan liability and related asset which consist of mutual fund classified trading security and are included in other asset allowance for doubtful account the company maintains allowance for doubtful account for estimated loss resulting from the inability of the company customer to make required payment the company considers the following factor when determining if collection of required payment is reasonably assured customer credit worthiness past transaction history with the customer current economic industry trend change in customer payment term and bank credit worthiness for letter of credit if the company ha no previous experience with the customer the company may request financial information including financial statement or other document to determine that the customer ha the mean of making payment the company may also obtain report from various credit organization to determine that the customer ha history of paying it creditor if these factor do not indicate collection is reasonably assured revenue is incorporatednotes to consolidated financial statementsdeferred reduction to account receivable until collection becomes reasonably assured which is generally upon receipt of cash if the financial condition of the company customer wa to deteriorate adversely affecting their ability to make payment additional allowance would be required inventory inventory are valued at the lower of cost or market replacement cost not to exceed net realizable value using the first in first out method recoverability of inventory is assessed based on review of future customer demand that considers multiple factor including committed purchase order from customer well purchase commitment projection provided by customer among other thing property plant and equipment property plant and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated or amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful life upon the retirement or disposition of property plant and equipment the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed and gain or loss is recorded building on owned land are depreciated over year and building improvement are depreciated over their useful life ranging from to year leasehold improvement are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful life not to exceed year or the remaining term of the related lease other property plant and equipment have useful life ranging from to year leased property meeting certain capital lease criterion is capitalized and the net present value of the related lease payment is recorded liability amortization of asset under capital lease is recorded using the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the lease term maintenance repair and minor renewal or betterment are charged to expense incurred goodwill and other intangible asset goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible asset of business acquired acquired intangible asset other than goodwill are amortized over their useful life unless the life are determined to be indefinite for intangible asset purchased in business combination the estimated fair value of the asset received are used to establish their recorded value for intangible asset acquired in non monetary exchange the estimated fair value of the asset transferred or the estimated fair value of the asset received if more clearly evident are used to establish their recorded value unless the value of neither the asset received nor the asset transferred are determinable within reasonable limit in which case the asset received are measured based on the carrying value of the asset transferred valuation technique consistent with the market approach income approach and or cost approach are used to measure fair value impairment of goodwill other indefinite lived asset and long lived asset goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset are tested annually for impairment in the fourth fiscal quarter and in interim period if certain event occur indicating that the carrying amount may be impaired if qualitative assessment is used and the company determines that the fair value of reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset is more likely than not likelihood of more than le than it carrying amount quantitative impairment test will be performed if goodwill is quantitatively assessed for impairment two step approach is applied first the company compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to it carrying value the second step if necessary measure the amount of impairment if any by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to it carrying value other indefinite lived intangible asset are quantitatively assessed for impairment if necessary by comparing their estimated fair value to their carrying value if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the difference is recorded an impairment long lived asset such property plant and equipment and intangible asset subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence that event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable recoverability of asset to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flow expected to be generated by the asset or asset group if the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds it estimated future cash flow an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group long lived asset to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or their estimated fair value le cost to sell and are not depreciated revenue recognition the company derives revenue principally from sale of integrated circuit product and licensing of it intellectual
