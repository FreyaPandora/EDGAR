information in any other item of the form or reflect any event that have occurred the filing of the form accordingly this amendment be read in conjunction with the form part iiitem management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation amount in million except per share share membership fee and warehouse count data overviewwe believe that the important driver of profitability is sale growth particularly comparable sale growth we define comparable sale sale from warehouse open for one year including remodels relocation and expansion well online sale related to website operating for more than one year comparable sale growth is achieved increasing shopping frequency from new and existing member and the amount spend on each visit average ticket sale comparison also be particularly influenced by certain factor that are beyond our control fluctuation in currency exchange rate with respect to the consolidation of the result of our international operation and change in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive condition primarily impacting our and canadian operation the higher our comparable sale exclusive of item the more we can leverage certain of our selling general and administrative expense reducing percentage of sale and enhancing profitability generating comparable sale growth is foremost question of making available to our member the right merchandise the right price skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated the long term another substantial factor in sale growth is the health of the economy in we do business especially the united state sale growth and gross margin are also impacted by our competition which is vigorous and widespread across wide range of global national and regional wholesaler and retailer we can not control or reliably predict general economic health or change in competition we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these change such through adjustment to our pricing and to our merchandise mix including increasing the penetration of our private label item our philosophy is to provide our member with quality good and service at the most competitive price we do not focus in the short term on maximizing price charged instead seek to maintain we believe is perception among our member of our pricing authority consistently providing the most competitive value our investment in merchandise pricing can from time to time include reducing price on merchandise to drive sale or meet competition and holding price steady despite cost increase instead of passing the increase on to our member all negatively impacting near term gross margin percentage of net sale gross margin percentage we believe that our gasoline business draw member but generally ha significantly lower gross margin percentage relative to our non gasoline business higher penetration of gasoline sale will generally lower our gross margin percentage rapidly changing gasoline price may significantly impact our near term net sale growth generally rising gasoline price benefit net sale growth item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation amount in million except per share share membership fee and warehouse count data continued which given the higher sale base negatively impact our gross margin percentage but decrease our selling general and administrative expense percentage of net sale decline in gasoline price ha the inverse effect we also achieve sale growth by opening new warehouse our warehouse base grows available and desirable potential site become more difficult to secure and square footage growth becomes comparatively le substantial component of growth the negative aspect of such growth however including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouse and cannibalization of sale at existing warehouse opening occur in existing market are increasingly le significant relative to the result of our total operation our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign market due to the smaller base in market and we expect that to continue our online business growth domestically and internationally ha also increased our sale our membership format is an integral part of our business model and ha significant effect on our profitability this format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue the extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base increase penetration of our executive member and sustain high renewal rate materially influence our profitability our financial performance depends heavily on our ability to control cost while we believe that we have achieved success in this area historically significant cost are partially outside our control most particularly health care and utility expense with respect to expense relating to the compensation of our employee our philosophy is not to seek to minimize wage and benefit rather we believe that achieving our longer term objective of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation level that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce this may cause for example to absorb cost that other employer might seek to pas through to their workforce our business is operated on low margin modest change in various item in the income statement particularly merchandise cost and selling general and administrative expense can have substantial impact on net income our operating model is generally the across our canada and other international operating segment see note to the consolidated financial statement included in item of this report certain country in the other international segment have relatively higher rate of square footage growth lower wage and benefit cost percentage of country sale and or le or no direct membership warehouse competition additionally we operate our lower margin gasoline business in all country except mexico korea and taiwan in discussion of our consolidated operating result we refer to the impact of change in foreign currency relative to the dollar which are reference to the difference the foreign exchange rate we use to convert the financial result of our international operation from local currency into dollar for financial reporting purpose this impact of foreign exchange rate change is calculated based on the difference between the current period currency exchange rate and that of the comparable prior

authority when fact and circumstance change we reassess these position and record any change in the consolidated financial statement appropriate additionally our cumulative foreign undistributed earnings were considered indefinitely reinvested of august these earnings would be subject to income tax if we changed our position and could result in deferred tax liability although we have
