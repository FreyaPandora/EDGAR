based on historical experience and various other factor that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstance actual result may differ from these estimate under various assumption or condition the company review it financial reporting and disclosure practice and accounting policy quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment the company belief that of it significant accounting policy the following involve higher degree of judgment and or complexity property and equipmentproperty and equipment are depreciated or amortized on straight line basis over their useful life based on management estimate of the period over which the asset will generate revenue not to exceed lease term plus option for leased property the useful life are estimated based on historical experience with similar asset taking into account anticipated technological or other change the company periodically review these life relative to physical factor economic factor and industry trend if there are change in the planned use of property and equipment or if technological change occur more rapidly than anticipated the useful life assigned to these asset may need to be shortened resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write offs in future period share based compensationthe company ha share based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity based incentive including stock option and restricted stock unit rsus to employee and nonemployee director the expense for these equity based incentive is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using closed form pricing model the pricing model requires assumption which impact the assumed fair value including the expected life of the stock option the risk free interest rate expected volatility of the company stock over the expected mcdonald corporation annual reportlife and the expected dividend yield the company us historical data to determine these assumption and if these assumption change significantly for future grant share based compensation expense will fluctuate in future year the fair value of each rsu granted is equal to the market price of the company stock at date of grant le the present value of expected dividend over the vesting period long lived asset impairment reviewlong lived asset including goodwill are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in assessing the recoverability of the company long lived asset the company considers change in economic condition and make assumption regarding estimated future cash flow and other factor estimate of future cash flow are highly subjective judgment based on the company experience and knowledge of it operation these estimate can be significantly impacted by many factor including change in global and local business and economic condition operating cost inflation competition and consumer and demographic trend key assumption impacting estimated future cash flow is the estimated change in comparable sale if the company estimate or underlying assumption change in the future the company may be required to record impairment charge based on the annual goodwill impairment test conducted in the fourth quarter the company doe not have any reporting unit defined each individual country with goodwill currently at risk of impairment litigation accrualsin the ordinary course of business the company is subject to proceeding lawsuit and other claim primarily related to competitor customer employee franchisees government agency intellectual property shareholder and supplier the company is required to ass the likelihood of any adverse

required accrual may change in the future due to new development in each matter or change in approach such change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matter the company doe not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have material adverse effect on it financial condition or result of operation income taxesthe company record valuation allowance to reduce it deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred asset will not be realized while the company ha considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategy including the sale of appreciated asset in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if these estimate and assumption change in the future the company may be required to adjust it valuation allowance this could result in charge to or an increase in income in the period such determination is made the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdiction and is subject to audit in these jurisdiction the company record accrual for the estimated outcome of these audit and the accrual may change in the future due to new development in each matter in the internal revenue service irs completed it examination of the company federal income tax return for and the company and the irs reached an agreement on adjustment that had been previously proposed by the irs the agreement did not have material impact on the company cash flow result of operation or financial position the company and federal income tax return are currently under examination and the completion of the field examination is expected in in connection with this examination the company received notice of proposed adjustment nopas in and expects to receive additional nopas within the next month from the irs related to certain transfer pricing matter it is reasonably possible that the receipt of these future nopas will provide new information that cause the company to reassess the total amount of unrecognized tax benefit recorded while the company can not estimate the impact that new information may have on our unrecognized tax benefit balance we believe that the liability recorded are appropriate and adequate determined under topic income tax of the accounting standard codification deferred income tax have not been recorded for temporary difference totaling billion related to

effectively this ability is because of rapid inventory turnover the ability to adjust menu price cost control and substantial property holding many of which are at fixed cost and partly financed by debt made le expensive by inflation reconciliation of return on incremental invested capitalroiic is measure reviewed by management over one year and three year time period to evaluate the overall profitability of our market the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital this measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rate to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation the numerator is the company incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period the denominator is the weighted average cash used for investing activity during the applicable one or three year period the weighted average cash used for investing activity is based on weighting applied on quarterly basis these weighting are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter investing activity to incremental operating income for example fourth quarter investing activity are weighted le because the asset purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income of fourth quarter investing activity are included in the one year and three year calculation in contrast fourth quarter is heavily weighted because the asset purchased were deployed more than month ago and therefore have full year impact on operating income with little or no impact to the base period and of fourth quarter investing activity are included in the one year and three year calculation respectively management belief that weighting cash used for investing activity provides more accurate reflection of the relationship between it investment and return than simple average the reconciliation to the most comparable measurement in accordance with accounting principle generally
