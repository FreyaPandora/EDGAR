intellectual property right and collaboration licensing right section in our financial report and item risk factor dependence on key in line product below company have filed application with the fda seeking approval of product candidate that such company claim do not infringe our patent these include candidate that would compete with among other product eliquis xeljanz and xtandi we also are often involved in other proceeding such inter partes review post grant review re examination or opposition proceeding before the patent and trademark office the european patent office or other foreign counterpart relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property right of others for additional information see the note to consolidated financial statement note contingency and certain commitment legal proceeding patent litigation in our financial report the expiration of basic product patent or loss of patent protection resulting from legal challenge normally result in significant competition from generic product against the originally patented product and can result in significant reduction in revenue for that product in short period of time in some case however we can continue to obtain commercial benefit from product manufacturing trade secret patent on us for product patent on process and intermediate for the economical manufacture of the active ingredient patent for special formulation of the product or delivery mechanism or conversion of the active ingredient to otc product biologic productsour biologic product including benefix refacto xyntha bavencio prevnar prevenar and enbrel we market enbrel outside the and canada may face in the future or already face competition from biosimilars also referred to follow on biologics in the such biosimilars would reference our originator biologic product approved under the public health service act additionally the fda ha approved follow on recombinant human growth hormone that referenced our biotechnology product genotropin that wa approved under the ffdca biosimilars are version of biologic medicine that have been developed and proven to be highly similar to the original biologic in term of safety and efficacy and that have no clinically meaningful difference in safety purity or potency biosimilars have the potential to offer high quality lower cost alternative to biologic medicine abbreviated legal pathway for the approval of biosimilars exist in certain international market and since the passage of the aca in framework for such approval exists in the in europe the european commission grant marketing authorization for biosimilars pursuant to set of general and product class specific guideline for biosimilar approval part of our business strategy we are capitalizing on our expertise in biologics manufacturing well our regulatory and commercial strength to develop and commercialize biosimilar medicine see item risk factor biologic product below we may face litigation with respect to the validity and or scope of patent relating to our biologic product likewise we develop manufacture and seek to launch biosimilars patent may be asserted against internationalone of the main limitation on our operation in some country outside the is the lack of effective intellectual property protection for our product under international and free trade agreement in recent year we have seen some improvement in global protection of intellectual property right for additional information see item business government regulation and price constraint outside the united state intellectual property below competitionour business are conducted in intensely competitive and often highly regulated market many of our prescription pharmaceutical product face competition in the form of branded or generic drug or biosimilars that treat similar disease or indication the principal form of competition include efficacy safety ease of use and cost effectiveness though the mean of competition vary among product category and business group demonstrating the value of our product is critical factor for success in all of our principal business our competitor include other worldwide research based biopharmaceutical company smaller research company with more limited therapeutic focus generic and biosimilar drug manufacturer and consumer healthcare manufacturer we compete with other company that manufacture and sell product that treat disease or indication similar to those treated by our major product this competition affect our core product business which is focused on applying innovative science to discover and market product that satisfy unmet medical need and provide therapeutic improvement our emphasis on innovation is underscored by our multi billion dollar investment in well our business development transaction both designed to result in strong product pipeline our investment in research doe not stop with drug approval we continue to invest in further understanding the value of our product for the condition they treat well potential new application we seek to protect the health and well being of patient by striving to ensure that medically sound knowledge of the benefit and risk of our medicine is understood and communicated to patient physician payer and global health authority we also seek to continually enhance the organizational effectiveness of all of our biopharmaceutical function including coordinating support for our salesperson effort to accurately and ethically launch and promote our product to our customer operating condition have become more challenging under mounting global pressure of competition industry regulation and cost containment we continue to take measure to evaluate adapt and improve our organization and business practice to better meet customer and public need we believe that we have taken an industry leading role in evolving our approach to direct to consumer advertising interaction with and payment to healthcare professional and medical education grant we also continue to sponsor program to address patient affordability and access barrier we strive to advance fundamental health system change through support for better healthcare solution our vaccine business may face competition from the introduction of alternative or next generation vaccine for example prevnar may face competition in the form of alternative valent or additional valent next generation pneumococcal conjugate vaccine prior to the expiration of it patent which may adversely affect our future result our generic and biosimilars business compete with branded product from competitor well other generic and biosimilars manufacturer globally pfizer sell generic version of pfizer well certain competitor solid oral dose and sterile injectable pharmaceutical product well biosimilars we seek to maximize the opportunity to establish first to pfizer inc form of contentsmarket or early market position for our generic injectable drug and biosimilars first to market position provides customer lower cost alternative immediately available and also may provide with potentially higher level of sale and profitability until other generic or biosimilar competitor enter the market our consumer healthcare business face competition from otc business unit in other major pharmaceutical and consumer packaged good company and retailer who carry their own private label brand our competitive position is affected by several factor including the amount and effectiveness of our and our competitor promotional resource customer acceptance product quality our and our competitor introduction of new product ingredient claim dosage form or other form of innovation and pricing regulatory and legislative matter such product labeling patient access and prescription to otc switch managed care organizationsthe evolution of managed care in the ha been major factor in the competitive makeup of the healthcare marketplace approximately million people in the have some form of health insurance coverage due to the expansion of health insurance coverage see item business government regulation and price constraint in the united state below the marketing of prescription drug to both consumer and the entity that manage this expanded coverage in the continues to grow in importance the influence of mcos ha increased in recent year due to the growing number of patient receiving coverage through mcos at the time those organization have been consolidating into fewer even larger entity this consolidation enhances both their ability to negotiate well their importance to pfizer the growth of mcos ha increased pressure on drug price well revenue one objective of mcos is to contain and where possible reduce healthcare expenditure mcos typically negotiate price with pharmaceutical provider by using formulary which are list of approved medicine available to member of the mcos clinical protocol requiring prior authorization for branded product if generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic product before permitting access to branded medicine volume purchasing long term contract and their ability to influence volume and market share of prescription drug in addition by placing branded medicine on higher tier status in their formulary leading to higher patient co pay or non preferred tier status mcos transfer portion of the cost of the medicine to the patient resulting in significant out of pocket expense for the patient especially for chronic treatment this financial disincentive is tool for mcos to manage drug cost and channel patient to medicine preferred by the mcos mcos also use additional measure such new to market block exclusion list indication based pricing copay accumulator program and value based pricing contracting to improve their cost containment effort we are closely monitoring these newer approach and developing appropriate strategy to respond to them due to their generally lower cost generic medicine typically are placed in lowest cost tier of mco formulary the breadth of the product covered by formulary can vary considerably from one mco to another and many formulary include alternative and competitive product for treatment of particular medical problem mcos are currently evaluating the appropriate placement of biosimilars on their formulary exclusion of product from formulary or other mco implemented restriction can significantly impact drug usage in the mco patient population consequently pharmaceutical company compete to gain access to formulary for their product unique product feature such greater efficacy better patient ease of use or fewer side effect are generally beneficial to achieving access to formulary however lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor we have been generally although not universally successful in our major product included on mco formulary however increasingly our branded product are being placed on the higher tier or in non preferred status mcos also emphasize primary and preventive care out patient treatment and procedure performed at doctor office and clinic another way to manage cost hospitalization and surgery typically the most expensive form of treatment are carefully managed since the use of certain drug can reduce the need for hospitalization professional therapy or even surgery such drug can become favored first line treatment for certain disease the aca ha accelerated payment reform by distributing risk across mcos and other stakeholder in care delivery with the intent of improving quality while reducing cost which creates pressure on mcos to tie reimbursement to defined outcome we anticipate continued congressional interest in modifying provision of the aca particularly given the recent ruling in texas azar to invalidate the law unconstitutional though we believe it is unlikely congress will find bipartisan consensus to advance any significant change to the aca until the legal process unfolds we are monitoring any such action to see if any change to the aca will be enacted that would impact our business generic productsone of the biggest competitive challenge that our branded product face is from generic pharmaceutical manufacturer upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for product especially small molecule product we can lose the major portion of revenue for that product in very short period of time several competitor make regular practice of challenging our product pfizer inc form of contentspatents before their expiration generic competitor often operate without large expense well without cost of conveying medical information about product to the medical community in addition the fda approval process exempts generic from costly and time consuming clinical trial to demonstrate their safety and efficacy allowing generic manufacturer to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product generic competitor can market competing version of our product after the expiration or loss of our patent and often charge much le in china for example we are expected to face strong competition by certain generic manufacturer in which may result in price cut and volume loss of some of our product in addition our patent protected product can face competition in the form of generic version of competitor branded product that lose their market exclusivity noted mcos that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drug often favor generic over brand name drug many government also encourage the use of generic alternative to brand name drug in their healthcare program including medicaid in the law in the generally allow and in some case require pharmacist to substitute for brand name drug generic drug that have been rated under government procedure to be chemically and therapeutically equivalent to brand name drug in small subset of state prescribing physician are able to expressly prevent such substitution favoring generic may reduce sale of our branded product raw materialsraw material essential to our business are purchased worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous supplier in general these material are available from multiple source in we experienced periodic shortage of select material due to constrained capacity or operational challenge with the associated supplier supplier management activity are ongoing to work to ensure the necessary supply to meet our requirement for these material no significant impact to our operation is anticipated in government regulation and price constraintspharmaceutical company are subject to extensive regulation by government authority in the country in which they do business certain law and regulation that govern pfizer business are discussed below general our business ha been and will continue to be subject to numerous law and regulation failure to comply with these law and regulation including those governing the manufacture and marketing of our product could subject to administrative and legal proceeding and action by various governmental body for additional information on these proceeding and action see the note to consolidated financial statement note contingency and certain commitment legal proceeding in our financial report criminal charge substantial fine and or civil penalty warning letter and product recall or seizure delay in product approval well limitation on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdiction could result from such proceeding and action in the united statesdrug regulation in the biopharmaceutical product are subject to extensive pre and postmarket regulation by the fda including regulation that govern among other thing the safety and efficacy of our medicine clinical trial advertising and promotion manufacturing labeling and record keeping our product are also subject to postmarket surveillance under the ffdca and it implementing regulation with respect to drug well the public health service act and it implementing regulation with respect to biologics our consumer healthcare product are also subject to fda regulation other federal agency including the dea also regulate certain of our product the federal trade commission ha the authority to regulate the advertising of consumer healthcare product including otc drug and dietary supplement many of our activity also are subject to the jurisdiction of the sec biopharmaceutical company seeking to market product in the must first test the product to demonstrate that it is safe and effective for it intended use if after evaluation the fda determines the product is safe it benefit outweigh it known risk and effective the fda will approve the product for marketing issuing nda or bla appropriate company seeking to market generic prescription drug must scientifically demonstrate that the generic drug is bioequivalent to the innovator drug the anda or generic drug application must show among other thing that the generic drug is pharmaceutically equivalent to the brand the manufacturer is capable of making the drug correctly and the proposed label is the same that of the innovator brand drug label even after drug or biologic is approved for marketing it may still be subject to postmarketing commitment or postmarketing requirement postmarketing commitment are study or clinical trial that the drug or biologic sponsor ha agreed to conduct but are not required by law and or regulation postmarketing requirement include study and clinical trial that sponsor are required to conduct by law and or regulation condition of approval postmarketing study or clinical trial can be required in order to ass known risk or demonstrate clinical benefit for drug or biologics approved pursuant to accelerated approval if company fails to meet it postmarketing requirement the fda may ass civil monetary penalty issue warning letter or deem the drug or biologic misbranded drug or biologic is approved any modification to the product must be notified to the fda and may also require manufacturer to submit additional study or conduct clinical trial in addition we are also required to report adverse event and comply with cgmps well advertising and promotion regulation failure to comply with the ffdca may subject to administrative and or judicial sanction including warning letter product recall seizure delay in product approval injunction fine civil penalty and or criminal prosecution biosimilar regulation the aca created framework for the approval of biosimilars also known follow on biologics following the expiration of year of exclusivity for the innovator biologic with potential six month pediatric extension under the aca biosimilar application may not be submitted until four year after the approval of the reference innovator biologic the fda is responsible for implementation of the legislation and approval of new biosimilars through fda approval and the issuance of draft and final guidance the fda ha addressed number of issue related to the biosimilars approval pathway such the labeling expectation for biosimilars over the next several year the fda is expected to issue additional draft and final guidance document impacting biosimilars including updated draft or final guidance regarding the standard for demonstrating interchangeability with licensed reference product in addition in the biosimilar user fee act wa reauthorized for five year period which should lead to significant increase in the fda biosimilar user fee revenue thereby providing the fda with additional resource to process biosimilar application for example in the first year under the newly authorized fee structure the fda estimate it revenue from biosimilar user fee will increase by more than million sale and marketing law and regulation the marketing practice of biopharmaceutical company are generally subject to various federal and state healthcare law that are intended among other thing to prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and to protect the integrity of government healthcare program these law include anti kickback law and false claim law anti kickback law generally prohibit biopharmaceutical company from soliciting offering receiving or paying anything of value to generate business including purchasing or prescribing of particular product false claim law generally prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting or causing to be presented any claim for payment for good including drug or biologics or service to third party payer including medicare and medicaid that are false or fraudulent and generally treat claim generated through kickback false or fraudulent violation of fraud and abuse law may be punishable by criminal or civil sanction and or exclusion from federal healthcare program including medicare and medicaid the federal government and various state also have enacted law to regulate the sale and marketing practice of pharmaceutical company the law and regulation generally limit financial interaction between manufacturer and healthcare provider require disclosure to the federal or state government and the public of such interaction and or require the adoption of compliance standard or program many of these law and regulation contain ambiguous requirement or require administrative guidance for implementation individual state acting through their attorney general have become active well seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription drug under state consumer protection and false advertising law given the lack of clarity in law and their implementation our activity could be subject to the penalty under the pertinent law and regulation pricing and reimbursement pricing and reimbursement for our pharmaceutical product depends in part on government regulation pfizer must offer discounted pricing or rebate on purchase of pharmaceutical product under various federal and state healthcare program such the medicaid drug rebate program the federal ceiling price drug pricing program the drug pricing program and the medicare part program pfizer must also report specific price to government agency under healthcare program such the medicaid drug rebate program and medicare part the calculation necessary to determine the price reported are complex and the failure to report price accurately may expose pfizer to penalty see the discussion regarding rebate in the analysis of the consolidated statement of income revenue overview section in our financial report and in the note to consolidated financial statement note basis of presentation and significant accounting policy revenue and trade account receivable in our financial report which are incorporated by reference government and private third party payer routinely seek to manage utilization and control the cost of our product for example the majority of state use preferred drug list to restrict access to certain pharmaceutical product under medicaid restriction exist for some pfizer product under certain state medicaid program another example access to our product under the medicaid managed care program is typically determined by the health plan with which state medicaid agency contract to provide service to medicaid beneficiary given certain state current and potential ongoing fiscal crisis growing number of state are considering variety of cost control strategy including capitated managed care plan that typically contain cost by restricting access to certain treatment in addition we expect that consolidation and integration of pharmacy chain and wholesaler who are the primary purchaser of our pharmaceutical product in the will increase pricing pressure on pharmaceutical manufacturer including effort by government official or legislator to implement measure to regulate price or payment for pharmaceutical product including legislation on drug importation could adversely affect our business if implemented recently there ha been considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and proposal to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceutical at the federal level for example in may president trump released his blueprint to lower drug price and reduce out of pocket cost blueprint certain proposal in the blueprint and related drug pricing measure proposed since the blueprint could cause significant operational and reimbursement change for the pharmaceutical industry another example in october the center for medicare and medicaid service solicited public comment on potential change to payment for certain medicare part drug including reducing the medicare payment amount for selected medicare part drug to more closely align with international drug price in addition in january the white house office of management and budget released the long awaited proposed rule submitted by the office of inspector general of the department of health and human service to remove safe harbor protection for drug rebate paid to insurance plan and pbms for medicare part and managed medicaid and to create new safe harbor among other change the proposed rule would explicitly exclude the reduction in price offered by drug manufacturer to pbms in medicare part and managed medicaid plan from protection under the discount safe harbor it would also create new safe harbor designed specifically for price reduction in pharmaceutical product but only those that are fully reflected in the price to the patient at the pharmacy counter additionally new safe harbor wa proposed to protect administrative fee paid to pbms which must be at fair market value fixed fee and not based upon percentage of volume or list price manufacturer could continue to negotiate price reduction with pbms and medicare part and managed medicaid plan if their reduction meet that criterion the proposed rule represents large step toward significantly altering the current rebate model in place with mcos we are in the process of evaluating the implication of the proposed rule on our operation and process well the infrastructure that will be required in order to implement the rule once it is finalized there have also been recent state legislative effort to address drug cost which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug cost or limiting drug price certain state legislation ha been subject to legal challenge adoption of new legislation regulating drug pricing at the federal or state level could further affect demand for or pricing of our product we believe medicine are the most efficient and effective use of healthcare dollar based on the value they deliver to the overall healthcare system we will continue to work with lawmaker and advocate for solution that effectively improve patient health outcome lower cost to the healthcare system and ensure access to medicine within an efficient and affordable healthcare system healthcare reform there have been significant effort at the federal and state level to reform the healthcare system by enhancing access to healthcare improving the delivery of healthcare and further rationalizing payment for healthcare for example we face uncertainty due to federal legislative and administrative effort to repeal substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provision of the aca for example tax reform legislation enacted at the end of eliminates the tax penalty for individual who do not maintain sufficient health insurance coverage beginning in the so called individual mandate we anticipate continued congressional interest in modifying provision of the aca particularly given the recent ruling in texas azar to invalidate the law unconstitutional at this time the law remains in effect pending appeal of the decision given the outcome of the midterm election with democrat taking over the house of representative and republican growing their majority in the senate we believe it is unlikely congress will find bipartisan consensus to advance any significant change to the aca until the legal process unfolds the revenue generated for pfizer by the health insurance exchange and medicaid expansion under the aca are not material so the impact of the change in law and similar recent administration action is expected to be limited any future replacement modification or repeal of the aca may adversely affect our business and financial result particularly if the legislation reduces incentive for employer sponsored insurance coverage another example the bipartisan budget act of which increased the discount we pay in the medicare part coverage gap from to will modestly increase our future medicare part rebate any future healthcare reform effort may adversely affect our business and financial result anti corruption the fcpa prohibits corporation and their representative from offering promising authorizing or making payment to any foreign government official government staff member political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad the scope of the fcpa includes interaction with certain healthcare professional in many country other country have enacted similar anti corruption law and or regulation outside the united state we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issue in most other country new drug approval in the eu the approval of new drug may be achieved using the mutual recognition procedure the decentralized procedure or the eu centralized procedure these procedure apply in the eu member state plus the european economic area country norway iceland and liechtenstein the centralized procedure managed by the ema result in one single authorization for the whole eu which provides the most rapid and efficient mean of gaining approval across the eu and is the one most commonly used for new product in china the regulatory system historically presented numerous challenge for the pharmaceutical industry it requirement for drug development and registration were often inconsistent with or other international standard in recent year however china ha introduced reform and draft reform which are discussed in more detail below that attempt to address these challenge wa another active year in this respect with number of reform coming into effect and more proposal and draft being issued for consultation also in significant government restructuring resulted in the creation of the national medical product administration nmpa replacing the former cfda in japan the pmda is the point of entry for business looking to sell drug in the country the pmda which is involved in wide range of regulatory activity including clinical study approval postmarketing review and pharmaceutical safety must approve an application before new drug product may be marketed in japan the pmda also offer consultation on clinical trial of new drug and provides advice on product classification and approval health authority in many middle and lower income country require marketing approval by recognized regulatory authority similar to the authority of the fda or the ema before they begin to conduct their application review process and or issue their final approval many authority also require local clinical data in the country population in order to receive final marketing approval pharmacovigilance in the eu detailed legislation and guidance on pharmacovigilance ha increased and strengthened in recent year the ema pharmacovigilance risk assessment committee ha the responsibility for reviewing and making recommendation on product safety issue for the eu authority eu regulator may require pharmaceutical company to conduct post authorization safety and efficacy study at the time of approval or at any time afterwards in light of scientific development there are also additional extensive requirement regarding adverse drug reaction reporting and additional monitoring of product outside developed market such the eu and japan pharmacovigilance requirement vary and are generally not extensive but there is trend toward increasing regulation pricing and reimbursement in europe japan china canada south korea and some other international market government provide healthcare at low to zero direct cost to consumer at the point of care and have significant power large single payer to regulate pharmaceutical price or patient reimbursement level to control cost for the government sponsored healthcare system particularly under recent global economic pressure government may use variety of cost containment measure for our pharmaceutical product including price cut mandatory rebate health technology assessment forced localization condition of market access and international reference pricing the practice of country linking it regulated medicine price to those of other country this international patchwork of price regulation and differing economic condition and incomplete value assessment across country ha led to varying health outcome and some third party trade in our product between country in particular international reference pricing add to the regional impact of price cut in individual country and hinders patient access and innovation price variation exacerbated by international reference pricing system also have resulted from exchange rate fluctuation the downward pricing pressure resulting from this dynamic can be expected to continue result of reform to international reference pricing policy and measure targeting pharmaceutical in some european country in addition several important multilateral organization such the united nation un including the world health organization who and the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd are increasing scrutiny of international pharmaceutical pricing through issuing report and policy recommendation un high level panel report on access to medicine late in two new report critical of the pharmaceutical industry pricing practice were published oecd pharmaceutical innovation and access to medicine and who pricing of cancer medicine and it impact these report and upcoming public forum focused on their recommendation will continue to exert additional pricing pressure in china pricing pressure have increased in recent year top chinese government official have consistently emphasized the importance of improved health outcome the need for healthcare reform and decreased drug price key indicator of progress towards reform even though the government provides basic health insurance for the vast majority of chinese citizen the insurance is not adequate to cover innovative medicine alternative funding source for innovative medicine remain suboptimal private health insurance growth is restrained by issue with access to healthcare data potential corruption concern and control over provider in and chinese authority entered into special negotiation with china national medical security bureau to add approximately high value drug mainly oncology medicine to the national reimbursement drug list price for drug were reduced dramatically through these negotiation some by much percent while these negotiation included path to access for company market access is not strictly assured in addition significant question about the process and negotiation for provincial tendering remain in addition multi layered negotiation are required across provincial municipal and hospital level and the linkage of price negotiation to reimbursement is inconsistent in the off patent space in china began to implement quality consistency qce process in order to improve the quality of domestically manufactured generic drug primarily by requiring such drug to pas test to ass their bioequivalence to qualified reference drug typically the originator drug in numerous local generic were officially deemed bioequivalent under the qce pilot project for centralized procurement of category of drug covering major chinese city now drive patient to generic that have passed the qce which ha resulted in dramatic price cut for off patent drug in japan the access environment for innovative medicine continued to deteriorate in with tighter restriction around the criterion to gain price maintenance premium and push by the japanese government to adopt healthcare technology assessment based on rigid cost effectiveness criterion for re pricing of reimbursed medicine additionally the japanese government ha officially requested the ministry of health labour and welfare to look into using cost effectiveness analysis to make reimbursement decision at the launch of drug eu regulatory change the eu adopted new clinical trial regulation in may which is expected to come into effect sometime in late this regulation is aimed at simplifying and harmonizing the governance of clinical trial in the eu and will require increased public posting of clinical trial result brexit in june the electorate voted in referendum to leave the eu which is commonly referred to brexit in march the government formally notified the european council of it intention to leave the eu after it triggered article of the lisbon treaty to begin the two year negotiation process establishing the term of the exit and outlining the future relationship between the and the eu formal negotiation officially started in june this process continues to be highly complex and the end result of these negotiation may pose certain implication to our research commercial and general business operation in the and the eu including the approval and supply of our product the ema will be relocating from london to amsterdam netherlands by the scheduled date of brexit at the end of march at present it is still unclear whether and to extent the will remain within or aligned to the eu system of medicine regulation and or what separate requirement will be imposed in the after it leaf the eu however both the and the eu have issued detailed guidance for the industry on how medicine medical device and clinical trial will be separately regulated in their respective territory in the event of hard brexit meaning an outcome where no negotiated settlement is reached for additional information on brexit see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook our operating environment the global economic environment in our financial report china regulatory change in an effort to encourage drug innovation and reduce backlog for existing application for drug approval the nmpa ha unveiled numerous reform initiative for china drug approval system and engaged in significant effort to build it capability the nmpa now divide drug into new drug and generic with the definition for new drug changed from china new to global new this mean that drug previously approved in other market such the or europe will not be considered new drug under china regulatory regime this change in definition creates more opportunity for china domestic drug manufacturer than for multinational firm multinational firm have historically had significant competitive advantage in successfully achieving regulatory approval for drug first approved outside of china revision in made clear however that regulatory approval from the fda or the ema would no longer be required for approval of imported drug though notable exception persists for imported vaccine which still require prior approval from relevant regulatory agency the marketing authorization holder system which will allow for more flexibility in contract manufacturing arrangement and asset transfer is now being piloted in ten chinese province but not yet for imported drug while challenge remain number of other policy change are streamlining and accelerating approval of domestic and imported drug in china these reform along with china june entry into the management committee of the international council for harmonisation of technical requirement for pharmaceutical for human use are expected to pave the way for integration of chinese regulation with global practice these change include introducing an umbrella clinical trial authorization for all three phase of registration study instead of the original phase by phase approval filing recordation system for bioequivalence study on generic instead of the original review and approval system admitting more category of drug innovative drug eligible for the fast track green channel approval pathway and ongoing implementation of previously announced regulatory reform in the review timeline for clinical trial authorization wa shortened to working day due to the introduction of clinical trial notification system and china fast track policy wa finalized for specific group of product selected by the center for drug evaluation part of the nmpa in addition china human genetic resource administrative office strictly scrutinizes clinical trial involving the collection storage export and use of human genetic resource and relevant deriving data from the chinese population adding an extra layer of review in addition to that of the nmpa healthcare provider transparency and disclosure number of country have implemented law requiring or their industry association have recommended disclosure of transfer of value made by pharmaceutical company to healthcare provider for example the efpia disclosure code requires all member including pfizer to disclose transfer of value to healthcare professional and healthcare organization intellectual property the world trade organization agreement on trade related aspect of intellectual property right wto trip required participant country to amend their intellectual property law to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical product by with an extension until for least developed country while we still face patent grant enforcement and other intellectual property challenge around the world some country have made improvement we include stronger patent protection among the factor we consider for continued business expansion in other participant country while the global intellectual property environment ha generally improved following wto trip and bilateral multilateral trade agreement our future business growth depends on further progress in intellectual property protection in emerging market country in particular government have used intellectual property policy tool for reducing the price of imported medicine well to protect their local pharmaceutical industry considerable political and economic pressure exists to weaken current intellectual property protection and resist implementation of any further protection which ha led to policy such more restrictive standard for obtaining patent and more difficult procedure for patenting biopharmaceutical invention restriction on patenting certain type of invention new medical treatment method revocation of patent issuance and threat of issuance of compulsory license weak intellectual property enforcement and failure to implement effective regulatory data protection our industry advocacy effort focus on seeking more balanced business environment for foreign manufacturer well on underscoring the importance of strong intellectual property system for local innovative industry in developed country well including the eu we are facing an increasingly challenging intellectual property environment canada intellectual property regime for drug provides some level of patent protection and data exclusivity currently eight year plus six month pediatric extension but it lack the predictability and stability that otherwise comparable country provide through intense negotiation part of the canada eu comprehensive economic trade agreement ceta canadian authority have amended the patent medicine notice of compliance regulation to provide the innovator right of appeal and canada now provides sui generis protection for patent term extension of up to two year for basic patent furthermore the mexico canada agreement usmca if ratified and implemented would establish year of data protection for biologics and patent term adjustment for unreasonable or unnecessary delay in the grant of patent in china the intellectual property environment ha improved although effective enforcement and adequate legal remedy remain area of concern the government ha taken step to protect intellectual property right in conformity with world trade organization provision and several company including pfizer have established center in china due to increased confidence in china intellectual property environment despite this china remained on the trade representative priority watch list for further the standard for patentability in china remain more restrictive than in other major market including the europe and japan also while framework exists for protecting patent for year enforcement mechanism are often lacking or inconsistent for example the absence of effective patent linkage mechanism and preliminary injunction impractical evidentiary burden and heightened sufficiency standard have been used to invalidate patent at the enforcement stage in brazil and other latin american country the role of health regulatory authority in reviewing patent national health surveillance agency in brazil restrictive patentability rule ambiguity regarding the term of certain patent and backlog at patent agency may limit our ability to protect our product through patent the lack of regulatory data protection and difficulty in protecting certain type of invention such new medical us of drug product may limit the commercial lifespan of some pharmaceutical product additionally an increased threat of issuance of compulsory license for biopharmaceutical product exists which add to business uncertainty in india we have seen some progress in term of expediting patent approval process to reduce pendency rate and implementing training program to enhance enforcement despite these positive step gap remain in term of addressing longstanding intellectual property concern for example policy favoring compulsory licensing of patent the tendency of the indian patent office to revoke pharmaceutical patent in opposition proceeding both pre and post grant and restrictive standard for patentability of pharmaceutical product have made it difficult to safeguard many of our invention and our investment in innovation these policy heighten the risk of additional patent challenge targeting innovative pharmaceutical product especially in area perceived being important to the public health of the population challenge against pfizer patent in india are ongoing environmental mattersmost of our operation are affected by national state and or local

possible to predict or identify all such factor consequently you should not consider the following to be complete discussion of all potential risk or uncertainty risk related to our business industry and operation managed care trendsprivate third party payer and other managed care entity such pharmacy benefit manager continue to take action to manage the utilization of drug and control the cost of drug consolidation among mcos ha increased the negotiating power of mcos and other private third party payer private third party payer well government increasingly employ formulary to control cost by taking into account discount in connection with decision about formulary inclusion or favorable formulary placement failure to obtain or maintain timely adequate pricing or favorable formulary placement for our product or failure to obtain such formulary placement at favorable pricing could adversely impact revenue private third party payer including self insured employer often implement formulary with copayment tier to encourage utilization of certain drug and have also been raising co payment required from beneficiary particularly for branded pharmaceutical and biotechnology product private third party payer are also implementing new initiative like so called copay accumulator policy that provide that the value of copay assistance doe not count out of pocket cost that are applied toward deductible that can shift more of the cost burden to manufacturer and patient this cost shifting ha increased consumer interest and input in medication choice they pay for larger portion of their prescription cost and may cause consumer to favor lower cost generic alternative to branded pharmaceutical private third party payer also use additional measure such new to market block exclusion list indication based pricing and value based pricing contracting to improve their cost containment effort private third party payer also are increasingly imposing utilization management tool such clinical protocol requiring prior authorization for branded product if generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic product before permitting access to branded medicine the payer market consolidates further and more drug become available in generic form biopharmaceutical company may face greater pricing pressure from private third party payer who will continue to drive more of their patient to use lower cost generic alternative generic competitioncompetition from manufacturer of generic drug is major challenge for our branded product around the world and the loss or expiration of intellectual property right can have significant adverse effect on our revenue the date at which generic competition commences may be different from the date that the patent or regulatory exclusivity expires however upon the loss or expiration of patent protection for one of our product or upon the at risk launch despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product by generic manufacturer of generic version of one of our patented product we can lose the major portion of revenue for that product in very short period of time which can adversely affect our business number of our product are expected to face significantly increased generic competition over the next few year in china for example we are expected to face strong competition by certain generic manufacturer in which may result in price cut and volume loss of some of our product also generic manufacturer have filed application with the fda seeking approval of product candidate that such company claim do not infringe our patent these include candidate that would compete with among other product eliquis xeljanz and xtandi our licensing and collaboration partner also face challenge by generic drug manufacturer to patent covering product for which we have license or co promotion right in addition our patent protected product may face competition in the form of generic version of competitor branded product that lose their market exclusivity competitive productswe can not predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive product including new product entrant in line branded product generic product private label product biosimilars and product candidate that treat disease and condition similar to those treated by our in line drug and drug candidate the introduction of competitive product can result in erosion of the sale of our existing product and potential sale of product in development well unanticipated product obsolescence competitive product launch have occurred in recent year and certain potentially competitive product are in various stage of development some of these have been filed for approval with the fda and with regulatory authority in other country we also produce generic and biosimilar pharmaceutical product that compete with product from competitor including other generic and biosimilar manufacturer the ability to launch generic or biosimilar pharmaceutical product at or before the anticipated formation of the generic or biosimilar marketplace is important to that product profitability price for product typically decline sometimes dramatically following generic or biosimilar entry and additional company receive approval to market that product competition intensifies if company generic or biosimilar product can be first to market such that it only competition is the branded drug for period of time higher level of sale and profitability can be achieved until other generic or biosimilar competitor enter the market with increasing competition in the generic or biosimilar product market the timeliness with which we can market new generic or biosimilar product will increase in importance our success will depend on our ability to bring new product to market quickly the fda along with other regulatory agency around the world ha been pfizer inc form of contentsexperiencing backlog of generic drug application which may result in delayed approval of new generic product while the fda is taking step to address the backlog of pending application continued approval delay may be experienced by generic drug applicant over the next few year also we may face access challenge for our biosimilar product where our product may not receive appropriate formulary access or remains in disadvantaged position relative to the innovator product for example inflectra remsima ha experienced access challenge among commercial payer in september pfizer filed suit in the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania against johnson johnson alleging that exclusionary contract and other anticompetitive practice concerning remicade infliximab violate federal antitrust law dependence on key in line productswe recorded direct product and or alliance revenue of more than billion for each of ten biopharmaceutical product in prevnar prevenar lyrica ibrance eliquis enbrel lipitor xeljanz chantix champix sutent and norvasc those product accounted for of our total revenue in if these product or any of our other major product were to become subject to problem such loss of patent protection if applicable change in prescription growth rate material product liability litigation unexpected side effect regulatory proceeding publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence pressure from existing competitive product change in labeling pricing and access pressure supply shortage or if new more effective treatment should be introduced the adverse impact on our revenue could be significant number of our current product have experienced patent based expiration or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain market in the last few year including some of our billion dollar and previously billion dollar product and patent covering number of our best selling medicine are or have been the subject of pending legal challenge for example result of patent litigation settlement teva pharmaceutical usa inc launched generic version of viagra in the in december in addition the basic product patent for lyrica in the will expire in june which includes the fda grant of pediatric exclusivity that extended the period of market exclusivity in the for lyrica for an additional six month from december in addition our revenue could be significantly impacted by the timing and rate of commercial acceptance of key new product for additional information see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook our operating environment industry specific challenge intellectual property right and collaboration licensing right recent loss and expected loss of product exclusivity section in our financial report further our alliance revenue will be adversely affected by the termination or expiration of collaboration and co promotion agreement that we have entered into and that we may enter into from time to time research and development investmentthe discovery and development of safe effective new product well the development of additional us for existing product are necessary for the continued strength of our business our product line must be replenished over time in order to offset revenue loss when product lose their market exclusivity well to provide for earnings growth our growth potential depends in large part on our ability to identify and develop new product or new indication for existing product that address unmet medical need and receive reimbursement from payer either through internal or through collaboration acquisition joint venture or licensing or other arrangement with third party however balancing current growth investment for future growth and the delivery of shareholder return remains major challenge the average cost of product development continue to rise do the regulatory requirement in many therapeutic area which may affect the number of candidate funded well the sustainability of the portfolio our ongoing investment in new product introduction and in for new product and existing product extension could exceed corresponding sale growth additionally our investment plan and resource may not be correctly matched between science and market and failure to invest in the right technology platform therapeutic segment product class geographic market and or in licensing and out licensing opportunity could adversely impact the productivity of our pipeline further even if the area with the greatest market attractiveness are identified the scientific approach may not succeed for any given program despite the significant investment required for and the commercial potential of the product may not be competitive expected because of the highly dynamic market environment and the hurdle in term of access and reimbursement we continue to strengthen our global organization and pursue strategy intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in to achieve sustainable pipeline that is positioned to deliver value in the near term and over time these strategy may not deliver the desired result which could affect growth and profitability in the future biologic productsabbreviated legal pathway for the approval of biosimilars exist in many international market and since the passage of the aca framework for such approval exists in the if competitor are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing our biologic product our biologic product may become subject to competition from these biosimilars with attendant competitive pressure and price reduction could follow for example enbrel face ongoing biosimilar competition in most developed europe market the expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent right could trigger this competition assuming any relevant regulatory exclusivity period ha expired we may face litigation with respect to the validity and or scope of patent relating to our biologic product pfizer inc form of contentswe are developing biosimilar medicine risk related to our development of biosimilars include the potential for steeper than anticipated price erosion due to increased competitive intensity or in the case of inflectra remsima exclusionary contracting by the originator that lead to lack of payer coverage and lower uptake coupled with high cost associated with clinical development or intellectual property challenge that may preclude timely commercialization of our potential biosimilar product there is also risk of lower uptake for biosimilars due to various factor that may vary for different biosimilars anti competitive practice physician reluctance to prescribe biosimilars for existing patient taking the originator product or misaligned financial incentive see also the competitive product risk factor above research studiesdecisions about research study made early in the development process of drug or vaccine candidate can have substantial impact on the marketing strategy and payer reimbursement possibility if it receives regulatory approval for example wider range of study can lead to approval for broader set of indication that may impact the marketing and payer reimbursement process however each additional indication must be balanced against the time and resource required to demonstrate benefit the increased complexity of development and manufacturing and the potential delay to approval of the lead indication we try to plan clinical trial prudently and to reasonably anticipate and address challenge but there is no guarantee that an optimal balance between trial conduct speed and desired outcome will be achieved each time the degree to which such potential challenge are foreseen and adequately addressed could affect our future result international operationsour international operation could be affected by currency fluctuation capital and exchange control economic condition expropriation and other restrictive government action change in intellectual property legal protection and remedy trade regulation and procedure and action affecting approval production pricing and marketing of reimbursement for and access to our product well by political unrest unstable government and legal system and inter governmental dispute any of these change could adversely affect our business many emerging market have experienced growth rate in excess of developed market leading to an increased contribution to the industry global performance result we have been employing strategy to grow in emerging market however our strategy in emerging market may not be successful and these country may not continue to sustain these growth rate for example even though china is growing faster than most emerging market we face certain challenge in china due to government imposed pricing control affecting certain pfizer medicine in addition some emerging market country may be particularly vulnerable to period of financial or political instability or significant currency fluctuation or may have limited resource for healthcare spending even though we constantly monitor the evolving emerging market for any unanticipated risk to pfizer certain financial or political event in such market discussed above can adversely affect our result specialty pharmaceuticalsspecialty pharmaceutical are medicine that treat rare or life threatening condition that typically have smaller patient population the growing availability and use of innovative specialty pharmaceutical combined with their relative higher cost compared to other type of pharmaceutical product ha generated payer interest in developing cost containment strategy targeted to this sector the impact of payer effort to control access to and pricing of specialty pharmaceutical is increasing for pfizer to date number of factor create more challenging paradigm given our growing specialty business portfolio these include formulary restriction and increasing use of utilization management tool such step edits which can lead to higher negotiated rebate or discount to health plan and pbms in the well the increasing use of health technology assessment in market around the world consumer healthcarethe consumer healthcare business may be impacted by economic volatility the timing and severity of the cough cold and flu season generic or store brand competition affecting consumer spending pattern and market share gain of competitor branded product or generic store brand in addition regulatory and legislative outcome regarding the safety efficacy or unintended us of specific ingredient in our consumer healthcare product may require withdrawal reformulation and or relabeling of certain product cough cold product see consumer healthcare joint venture with gsk and the global economic environment risk factor below product manufacturing sale and marketing risksdifficulties or delay in product manufacturing sale or marketing could affect future result through regulatory action shut down work stoppage or strike approval delay withdrawal recall penalty supply disruption or shortage reputational harm product liability unanticipated cost or otherwise example of such difficulty or delay include but are not limited to the inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand the failure to predict market demand for or to gain market acceptance of approved product the possibility that the supply of incoming material may be delayed or become unavailable and that the quality of incoming material may be substandard and not detected the possibility that we may fail to maintain appropriate quality standard throughout the internal and external supply network and or comply with cgmps and pfizer inc form of contentsother applicable regulation such serialization which allows for track and trace of product in the supply chain to enhance patient safety risk to supply chain continuity and commercial operation result of natural including hurricane earthquake and flood or man made disaster including arson or terrorist attack at our facility or at supplier or vendor including those that may be related to climate change or failure to maintain the integrity of our supply chain against intentional and criminal act such economic adulteration product diversion product theft counterfeit good and cyberattacks regulatory agency periodically inspect our drug manufacturing facility to evaluate compliance with applicable cgmp requirement failure to comply with these requirement may subject to possible legal or regulatory action such warning letter suspension of manufacturing seizure of product injunction debarment voluntary recall of product or failure to secure product approval any of which could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation in february for example we received warning letter from the fda communicating the fda view that certain violation of cgmp regulation exist at hospira manufacturing facility in mcpherson kansa we are undertaking corrective action to address the concern raised by the fda in january the fda upgraded the status of pfizer mcpherson manufacturing facility to vai based on an october inspection the change to vai status lifted the compliance hold that the fda placed on approval of pending application in june the fda informed that it had completed an evaluation of corrective action and closed out the february warning letter issued to our mcpherson manufacturing facility after determining that we had addressed the violation contained in the warning letter in july august the fda conducted follow up inspection of our mcpherson facility and issued an inspection report noting several finding pfizer responded to the fda finding and is in the process of implementing corrective and preventive action plan to address the fda concern on the basis of the july august fda inspection the fda changed the inspection classification status of the mcpherson site to official action indicated oai future fda inspection and regulatory activity will further ass the adequacy and sustainability of these correction communication with the fda on the status of the mcpherson site is ongoing result of this status the fda ha refused and may continue to refuse to grant premarket approval of application and or the fda may refuse to grant export certificate related to product manufactured at our mcpherson site until the site status is upgraded which will require successful re inspection by the fda the product shortage we have been experiencing within our portfolio are primarily for product from the legacy hospira portfolio and are largely driven by capacity constraint technical issue and supplier quality concern we continue to remediate issue at legacy hospira facility manufacturing sterile injectables any continuing product shortage interruption at these manufacturing facility could negatively impact our financial result specifically in our sterile injectable pharmaceutical portfolio in addition in september meridian medical technology inc subsidiary of pfizer inc received warning letter from the fda asserting the fda view that certain violation of cgmp and quality system regulation exist at meridian manufacturing site in st louis missouri meridian responded to the warning letter and committed to making improvement across the site we are undertaking corrective action to address the concern raised by the fda and communication with the fda is ongoing until the corrective action are implemented and confirmed by the fda following re inspection the fda may refuse to grant premarket approval of application and or the fda may refuse to grant export certificate related to product manufactured at our st louis site outsourcingwe outsource certain service to other party including transaction processing accounting information technology manufacturing clinical trial recruitment and execution clinical lab service non clinical research safety service integrated facility management and other area outsourcing of service to third party could expose to suboptimal quality of service delivery or deliverable and potentially result in repercussion such missed deadline or other timeliness issue erroneous data supply disruption non compliance including with applicable legal or regulatory requirement and industry standard and or reputational harm with potential negative effect on our result collaboration and other relationship with third party we depend on third party collaborator service provider and others in the research development manufacturing and commercialization of our product and product candidate and also enter into joint venture and other business development transaction in connection with our business to achieve expected longer term benefit we may make substantial upfront payment in such transaction which may negatively impact our reported earnings we rely heavily on these party for multiple aspect of our drug development manufacturing and commercialization activity but we do not control many aspect of those activity third party may not complete activity on schedule or in accordance with our expectation failure by one or more of these third party to meet their contractual or other obligation to pfizer failure of one or more of these party to comply with applicable law or regulation or any disruption in the relationship between pfizer and one or more of these third party could delay or prevent the development approval manufacturing or commercialization of our product and product candidate and could also result in non compliance or reputational harm all with potential negative implication for our product pipeline and business biopharmaceutical wholesalersin our largest biopharmaceutical wholesaler accounted for approximately of our total revenue and approximately of our total revenue and our top three biopharmaceutical wholesaler accounted for approximately of our total pfizer inc form of contentsrevenues and approximately of our total revenue if one of our significant biopharmaceutical wholesaler should encounter financial or other difficulty such wholesaler might decrease the amount of business that it doe with and we might be unable to collect all the amount that the wholesaler owes on timely basis or at all which could negatively impact our result of operation in addition we expect that consolidation and integration of pharmacy chain and wholesaler will increase competitive and pricing pressure on pharmaceutical manufacturer including business development activitieswe expect to continue to enhance our in line product and product pipeline through various form of business development which can include alliance license joint venture collaboration equity or debt based investment disposition divestments merger and acquisition however these enhancement plan are subject to the availability and cost of appropriate opportunity competition from other pharmaceutical company that are seeking similar opportunity and our ability to successfully identify structure and execute transaction including the ability to satisfy the condition to closing of announced transaction in the anticipated timeframes or at all and successfully integrate acquisition pursuing these opportunity may require to obtain additional equity or debt financing and could result in increased leverage and or downgrade of our credit rating where we acquire debt or equity security all or part of the consideration for business development activity such in connection with our contribution agreement entered into with allogene therapeutic inc the value of those security will fluctuate and may depreciate in value we may not control the company in which we acquire security such in connection with divestiture or collaborative arrangement and result we will have limited ability to determine it management operational decision and policy further while we seek to mitigate risk and liability of such transaction through among other thing due diligence there may be risk and liability that such due diligence effort fail to discover that are not disclosed to or that we inadequately ass legal proceeding or regulatory issue often arise result of activity that occurred at acquired company their partner and other third party in for example we paid million to resolve allegation related to wyeth reporting of price to the government with respect to protonix for activity that occurred prior to our acquisition of wyeth for these and other reason we may not realize the anticipated benefit of such transaction and expected synergy and accretion may not be realized within the expected timeframes or at all counterfeit productsa counterfeit medicine is one that ha been deliberately and fraudulently mislabeled to it identity and source counterfeit pfizer medicine therefore is one manufactured by someone other than pfizer but which appears to be the same an authentic pfizer medicine the prevalence of counterfeit medicine is significant and growing industry wide issue due to variety of factor including but not limited to the following the widespread use of the internet which ha greatly facilitated the ease by which counterfeit medicine can be advertised purchased and delivered to individual patient the availability of sophisticated technology that make it easier for counterfeiter to make counterfeit medicine the growing involvement in the medicine supply chain of under regulated wholesaler and repackagers the lack of adequate inspection at certain international postal facility counterfeit medicine are increasingly delivered direct to customer in small parcel package the tendency to misuse and abuse medicine and the relatively modest risk of penalty faced by counterfeiter compared to the large profit that can be earned by them from the sale of counterfeit medicine further law against pharmaceutical counterfeiting vary greatly from country to country and the enforcement of existing law varies greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction for example in some country pharmaceutical counterfeiting is not crime in others it may result in only minimal sanction in addition those involved in the distribution of counterfeit medicine use complex transport route in order to evade custom control by disguising the true source of their product pfizer global reputation make it medicine prime target for counterfeiting organization counterfeit medicine pose risk to patient health and safety because of the condition under which they are manufactured often in unregulated unlicensed uninspected and unsanitary site well the lack of regulation of their content failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicine which is exacerbated by the complexity of the supply chain could adversely impact our business by among other thing causing the loss of patient confidence in the pfizer name and in the integrity of our medicine potentially resulting in lost sale product recall and an increased threat of litigation we undertake significant effort to counteract the threat associated with counterfeit medicine including among other thing working with the fda and other regulatory authority and multinational coalition to combat the counterfeiting of medicine and supporting effort by law enforcement authority to prosecute counterfeiter assessing new and existing technology to seek to make it more difficult for counterfeiter to copy our product and easier for patient and healthcare provider to distinguish authentic from counterfeit medicine implementing business practice designed to protect patient health promoting public policy intended to hinder counterfeiting working diligently to raise public awareness about the danger of counterfeit medicine working collaboratively with wholesaler pharmacy custom office and law enforcement agency to increase inspection coverage monitor distribution channel and improve surveillance of distributor and repackagers and using data analytics and risk assessment tool to better target the factor that give rise to the counterfeiting problem in the first place however our effort and the effort of others may not be entirely successful and the presence of counterfeit medicine may continue to increase pfizer inc form of contentsrisks related to government regulation and legal proceeding pricing and reimbursementu and international governmental regulation that mandate price control and limitation on patient access to our product or establish price paid by government entity or program for our product impact our business and our future result could be adversely affected by change in such regulation or policy in the many of our product are subject to increasing pricing pressure pharmaceutical product pricing is subject to enhanced government and public scrutiny and call for reform some state have implemented and other state are considering pharmaceutical price control or patient access constraint under the medicaid program and some state are considering price control regime that would apply to broader segment of their population that are not medicaid eligible there have also been recent state legislative effort to address drug cost which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug cost or limiting drug price effort by government official or legislator to implement measure to regulate price or payment for pharmaceutical product including legislation on drug importation could adversely affect our business if implemented see the discussion regarding pricing and reimbursement in the item business government regulation and price constraint in the united state pricing and reimbursement section of this form private third party payer such health plan increasingly challenge pharmaceutical product pricing which could result in lower price lower reimbursement rate and reduction in demand for our product pricing pressure for our product may occur result of highly competitive insurance market healthcare provider purchaser directly or through group purchasing organization are seeking enhanced discount or implementing more rigorous bidding or purchasing review process we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issue in most other country in certain international market such the different eu member state japan china canada and south korea government have significant power large single payer to regulate price access criterion through public or private health technology assessment or other mean of cost control particularly under recent global financing pressure result we expect that pressure on the pricing component of operating result will continue the adoption of restrictive price control in new jurisdiction or more restrictive one in existing jurisdiction failure to obtain or maintain timely or adequate pricing or favorable formulary placement for our product or failure to obtain such formulary placement at favorable pricing could also adversely impact revenue in our vaccine business we participate in tender process in many country for participation in national immunization program failure to secure participation in national immunization program or to obtain acceptable pricing in the tender process could adversely affect our business healthcare reformthe healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial change for example the aca wa enacted by congress in march and established major expansion of healthcare coverage financed in part by number of new rebate discount and tax that had significant effect on our expense and profitability see the discussion under the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook our operating environment industry specific challenge regulatory environment pricing and access healthcare legislation section in our financial report and in item business government regulation and price constraint in the united state we face uncertainty due to federal legislative and administrative effort to repeal substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provision of the aca for example tax reform legislation enacted at the end of eliminates the tax penalty for individual who do not maintain sufficient health insurance coverage beginning in the so called individual mandate we anticipate continued congressional interest in modifying provision of the aca particularly given the recent ruling in texas azar to invalidate the law unconstitutional at this time the law remains in effect pending appeal of the decision given the outcome of the midterm election with democrat taking over the house of representative and republican growing their majority in the senate we believe it is unlikely congress will find bipartisan consensus to advance any significant change to the aca until the legal process unfolds the revenue generated for pfizer by the health insurance exchange and medicaid expansion under the aca are not material so the impact of the change in law and similar recent administration action is expected to be limited any future replacement modification or repeal of the aca may adversely affect our business and financial result particularly if the legislation reduces incentive for employer sponsored insurance coverage and we can not predict how other future federal or state legislative or administrative change relating to healthcare reform will affect our business other federal or state legislative or regulatory action and or policy effort could adversely affect our business including among others general budget control action change in patent law the importation of prescription drug from outside the at price that are regulated by government of various foreign country which is among the presidential administration policy proposal revision to reimbursement of biopharmaceuticals under government program such the implementation of international reference pricing for medicare part drug or change to protected class criterion for part drug restriction on direct to consumer advertising limitation on interaction with healthcare professional or the use of comparative effectiveness methodology that could be implemented in manner that focus primarily on cost difference and minimizes the therapeutic difference among pharmaceutical product and restricts access to innovative medicine pfizer inc form of contentsu entitlement reformin the government action to reduce federal spending on entitlement program including medicare and medicaid may affect payment for our product or service provided using our product the congressional budget office routinely release option for reducing federal spending and the december release includes proposal to cap federal medicaid payment to the state and to require manufacturer to pay minimum rebate on drug covered under medicare part for low income beneficiary significant medicare reduction could also result if for example congress proceeds with certain proposal to convert the medicare fee for service program into premium support program or congress chooses to implement the recommendation made annually by the medicare payment advisory commission which are primarily intended to extend the fiscal solvency of the medicare program these and any other significant spending reduction or cost control affecting medicare medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health program that may be implemented could have an adverse impact on our result of operation substantial regulationwe are subject to extensive complex costly and evolving regulation by federal and state governmental authority in the principally by the fda and the dea and foreign regulatory authority failure to comply with all applicable regulatory requirement may subject to operating restriction and criminal prosecution monetary penalty and other disciplinary action including sanction warning letter product seizure recall fine injunction suspension revocation of approval corporate integrity or deferred prosecution agreement or exclusion from future participation in government healthcare program well reputational harm development regulatory approval and marketing of productsinnovation is critical to the success of our company and drug discovery and development is time consuming expensive and unpredictable the outcome of the lengthy and complex process of identifying new compound and developing new product is inherently uncertain and involves high degree of risk and cost the process from early discovery to design and adequate implementation of clinical trial to regulatory approval can take many year drug candidate can and do fail at any stage of the process including the result of unfavorable pre clinical and clinical trial result or unfavorable new clinical data and further analysis of existing clinical data including result that may not support further clinical development of the applicable product candidate or indication we may not be able to meet anticipated pre clinical or clinical endpoint commencement and or completion date for our pre clinical or clinical trial regulatory submission date regulatory approval date and or launch date similarly we may not be able to successfully address all of the comment received from regulatory authority such the fda and the ema or obtain approval from regulator regulatory approval of drug or biologic product depends on myriad factor including regulator making determination to whether product benefit outweigh it known risk and determination of the product efficacy additionally clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretation and assessment by regulatory authority even after drug or biologic is approved it could be adversely affected by regulatory decision impacting labeling manufacturing process safety and or other matter we may not be able to receive or maintain favorable recommendation by technical or advisory committee such the advisory committee on immunization practice that may impact the use of our vaccine for example during the october acip meeting the center for disease control and prevention presented initial data and indicated formal evaluation of evidence grading and potential vote on the maintenance of the year and older recommendation for prevnar would likely happen in potential adverse change in the acip

including patent litigation such claim that our patent are invalid and or do not cover the product of the generic drug manufacturer or where one or more third party seek damage and or injunctive relief to compensate for alleged infringement of it patent by our commercial or other activity product liability and other product related litigation including personal injury consumer off label promotion security antitrust and breach of contract claim commercial environmental government investigation employment tax litigation and other legal proceeding including various mean for resolving asbestos litigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdict do occur although we believe that our claim and defense in matter in which we are defendant are substantial we could in the future incur judgment enter into settlement of claim or revise our expectation regarding the outcome of certain matter and such development could have material adverse effect on our result of operation in the period in which the amount are accrued and or our cash flow in the period in which the amount are paid claim against our patent include challenge to the coverage and or validity of our patent on various product or process although we believe we have substantial defense to these challenge with respect to all of our material patent there can be no assurance to the outcome of these matter and loss in any of these case could result in loss of patent protection for the product at issue which could lead to significant loss of sale of that product and could materially affect future result of operation like other pharmaceutical company we are subject to extensive regulation by government agency in the other developed market and multiple emerging market in which we operate result we have interaction with government agency on an ongoing basis criminal charge substantial fine and or civil penalty limitation on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdiction corporate integrity or deferred prosecution agreement well reputational harm and increased public interest in the matter could result from government investigation in addition in qui tam lawsuit in which the government decline to intervene the relator may still pursue suit for the recovery of civil damage and penalty on behalf of the government our activity relating to the sale and marketing and the pricing of our product are subject to extensive regulation under the ffdca the medicaid drug rebate program the fcpa and other federal and state statute including those discussed elsewhere in this form well anti kickback and false claim law and similar law in international jurisdiction like many company in our industry we have from time to time received inquiry and subpoena and other type of information demand from government authority and been subject to claim and other action related to our business activity brought by governmental authority well by consumer and private payer in some instance we have incurred significant expense civil payment fine and other adverse consequence result of these claim action and inquiry for example these claim action and inquiry may relate to alleged failure to accurately interpret or identify or prevent non compliance with the law and regulation associated with the dissemination of product information approved and unapproved potentially resulting in government enforcement and damage to our reputation this risk may be heightened by digital marketing including social medium mobile application and blogger outreach in connection with the resolution of government investigation concerning independent copay assistance organization that provide

requirement breach of the cia could result in severe sanction against for additional information including information regarding certain legal proceeding in which we are involved in see note to consolidated financial statement note contingency and certain commitment legal proceeding in our financial report environmental claim and proceedingswe and certain of our subsidiary are subject to numerous contingency arising in the ordinary course of business relating to environmental claim and proceeding amount recorded for legal and environmental contingency can result from complex series of judgment about future event and uncertainty and can rely heavily on estimate and assumption while we have accrued for worldwide environmental liability there is no guarantee that additional cost will not be incurred beyond the amount accrued if we fail to properly manage the safety of our facility and the environmental risk associated therewith or if we are required to increase our accrual for contingency for environmental claim and proceeding in the future it could potentially have an adverse effect on our result of operation risk related to intellectual property patent protectionour long term success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive product we rely and expect to continue to rely on combination of intellectual property including patent trademark trade dress copyright trade secret and domain name protection law well confidentiality and license agreement to protect our intellectual property and proprietary right if we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third party from launching generic or biosimilar version of our branded product using our proprietary technology or from marketing product that are very similar or identical to our currently pending or future patent application may not result in issued patent or be granted on timely basis similarly any term extension that we seek may not be granted on timely basis if at all in addition our issued patent may not contain claim sufficiently broad to protect against third party with similar technology or product or provide with any competitive advantage including exclusivity in particular product area the scope of our patent claim also may vary between country individual country have distinct patent law we may be subject to challenge by third party regarding our intellectual property including among others claim regarding validity enforceability scope and effective term our ability to enforce our patent also depends on the law of individual country and each country practice with respect to enforcement of intellectual property right and the extent to which certain sovereign may seek to engage in policy or practice that may weaken it intellectual property framework policy of routine compulsory licensing or threat of compulsory licensing of pharmaceutical intellectual property in country that provide some form of regulatory exclusivity mechanism exist permitting some form of challenge to our patent by competitor or generic drug marketer prior to or immediately following the expiration of such regulatory exclusivity and generic company are increasingly employing aggressive strategy such at risk launch that challenge our patent right most of the suit involve claim by generic drug manufacturer that patent covering our product process or dosage form are invalid and or do not cover the product of the generic drug manufacturer independent action have been filed alleging that our assertion of or attempt to enforce patent right with respect to certain product constitute unfair competition and or violation of antitrust law such claim may also be brought counterclaim to action we bring to enforce our patent we are also party to other patent damage suit in various jurisdiction pursuant to which generic drug manufacturer payer government or other party are seeking damage from for alleged delay of generic entry we also are often involved in other proceeding such inter partes review post grant review re examination or opposition proceeding before the patent and trademark office the european patent office or other foreign counterpart relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property right of others also if one of our patent is found to be invalid by such proceeding generic or competitive product could be introduced into the market resulting in the erosion of sale of our existing product for example several of the patent in our pneumococcal vaccine portfolio were challenged in inter partes review and post grant review proceeding in the in june the patent trial and appeal board ruled on one patent holding that one claim wa valid and that all other claim were invalid the party challenging that patent ha appealed the decision challenge to other patent remain pending before the patent and trademark office the invalidation of these patent could potentially allow competitor pneumococcal vaccine into the marketplace further if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreement or other agreement pursuant to which third party grant right to intellectual property including because such agreement expire or are terminated our operating result and financial condition could be materially adversely affected likewise in the and other country we currently hold issued trademark registration and have trademark application pending any of which may be the subject of governmental or third party objection which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the trademark our product mature our reliance on our trademark and trade dress to differentiate from our competitor increase and result if we are unable to prevent third party from adopting registering or using trademark and trade dress that infringe dilute or otherwise violate our trademark right our business could be materially adversely affected we actively seek to protect our proprietary information including our trade secret and proprietary know how by pfizer inc form of contentsrequiring our employee consultant other advisor and other third party to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreement upon the commencement of their employment engagement or other relationship despite these effort and precaution we may be unable to prevent third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secret or our other intellectual property without authorization and legal remedy in some country may not adequately compensate for the damage caused by such unauthorized use further others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical product that circumvent our intellectual property by mean of alternative design or process or otherwise third party intellectual property claimsa properly functioning intellectual property regime is essential to our business model we are committed to respecting the valid intellectual property right of other company but the patent granting process is imperfect accordingly the pursuit of valid business opportunity may require to challenge intellectual property right held by other company that we believe were improperly granted such challenge may include negotiation and litigation which may not always be successful part of our business depends upon successfully identifying generic pharmaceutical product and biosimilar opportunity and launching product to take advantage of those opportunity which may involve litigation associated cost and time delay and may ultimately not be successful these opportunity may arise in situation where patent protection of equivalent branded product ha expired where patent have been declared invalid or where product do not infringe the patent of others to achieve first to market or early market position for generic pharmaceutical product and biosimilars we may take action such litigation asserting that our product do not infringe patent of existing product or that those patent are invalid or unenforceable third party may claim that our product infringe one or more patent owned or controlled by the third party claim of intellectual property infringement can be costly and time consuming to resolve may delay or prevent product launch and may result in significant damage we are involved in patent related dispute with third party over our attempt to market generic pharmaceutical product and biosimilars once we have final regulatory approval of the related generic pharmaceutical product or biosimilars we may decide to commercially market these product even though associated legal proceeding including any appeal have not been resolved at risk launch if one of our marketed product is found to infringe valid patent right of third party such third party may be awarded significant damage or we may be prevented from further sale of that product such damage may be enhanced much three fold in the event that we or one of our subsidiary like hospira is found to have willfully infringed valid patent right of third party any of these adverse consequence could have material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition risk related to technology information technology and security significant disruption of information technology system or breach of information security could adversely affect our business we rely to large extent upon sophisticated information technology system to operate our business in the ordinary course of business we collect store and transmit large amount of confidential information including but not limited to personal information and intellectual property and we deploy and operate an array of technical and procedural control to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information we also have outsourced significant element of our operation to third party including significant element of our information technology infrastructure and result we are managing many independent vendor relationship with third party who may or could have access to our confidential information the size and complexity of our information technology and information security system and those of our third party vendor with we contract and the large amount of confidential information that is present on them make such system potentially vulnerable to service interruption or to security breach from inadvertent or intentional action by our employee or vendor or from attack by malicious third party such attack are of ever increasing level of sophistication and are made by group and individual with wide range of motif including but not limited to industrial espionage and expertise including organized criminal group hacktivists nation state and others global pharmaceutical company our system are subject to frequent attack due to the nature of some of these attack there is risk that they may remain undetected for period of time while we have invested in the protection of data and information technology our effort may not prevent service interruption or security breach any such interruption or breach of our system could adversely affect our business operation and or result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property and could result in financial legal business and reputational harm to we maintain cyber liability insurance however this insurance may not be sufficient to cover the financial legal business or reputational loss that may result from an interruption or breach of our system pfizer inc form of contentsrisks related to our strategic transaction strategic acquisitionsthe success of any of our strategic acquisition will depend in large part on our ability to realize anticipated benefit from combining these business with pfizer we for example may fail to achieve cost saving anticipated with certain of these acquisition or such cost saving within the expected time frame similarly the accretive impact anticipated from certain of these acquisition may not be realized or may be delayed integration of these business may result in the loss of key employee the disruption of ongoing business including third party relationship or inconsistency in standard control procedure and policy we also may fail to generate the revenue growth for the acquired business that we expected at the time of entering into the transaction expected revenue from acquired product and product candidate also may be constrained by development outside of our control unsuccessful clinical trial regulatory hurdle and commercialization challenge may adversely impact revenue and income contribution from product and product candidate including those acquired in these acquisition hospira for example ha experienced manufacturing disruption and substantial regulatory scrutiny due to quality issue manufacturing problem well any corrective action and their operational implementation could adversely impact the revenue we generate from product acquired from hospira and result in substantial unanticipated cost for additional information see the overview of

the anticipated benefit of the proposed transaction or allow the party to terminate the stock and asset purchase agreement which could negatively impact our stock price and our or the joint venture applicable future business and financial result we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefit of the proposed transaction the success of the proposed transaction will depend in part on the joint venture ability to realize the anticipated benefit and cost synergy from the proposed transaction these anticipated benefit and cost saving may not be realized or may not be realized within the expected time period the joint venture integration of pfizer and gsk consumer healthcare business may result in material unanticipated problem cost expense liability competitive response and loss of customer and other business relationship any material unanticipated issue arising from the integration process could negatively impact our stock price and our or the joint venture applicable future business and financial result moreover uncertainty about the effect of the proposed transaction on employee customer supplier distributor and other business partner may have an adverse effect on and the joint venture these uncertainty may impair our and or the joint venture ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel until the transaction is consummated and for period of time thereafter and could cause customer supplier distributor and others who deal with and or the joint venture to seek to change or cancel existing business relationship with and or the joint venture or fail to renew existing relationship employee retention may be challenging during the pendency of the proposed transaction certain employee may experience uncertainty about their future role if key employee depart because of issue related to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or desire not to remain with the combined business our business and the business of the joint venture following the

pfizer is entitled to participate in any separation and listing transaction initiated by gsk during the first five year after closing it is not required to do so and any future distribution or sale of pfizer equity stake in the joint venture will similarly be subject to prevailing market condition and other factor at the time of such transaction pfizer ability to complete any such future distribution or sale may also be impacted by the size of pfizer retained equity stake at the time the uncertainty relating to the separation and public listing transaction their implementation their timing and their yet to be determined effect on the joint venture business may subject and the joint venture to risk and uncertainty that may adversely affect our business and financial result the joint venture may be subject to additional risk beyond those associated with pfizer consumer healthcare business after completion of the transaction the joint venture will be subject to the risk associated with gsk consumer healthcare business in addition to the risk associated with pfizer consumer healthcare business and the business financial condition and result of operation of the joint venture may be affected by factor that are different from or in addition to those currently affecting the independent business financial condition and result of operation of pfizer consumer healthcare business many of these factor are outside of our and the joint venture control and could materially impact the business financial condition and result of operation of the joint venture moreover although we will have certain consent board representation and other governance right with respect to the joint venture pfizer will be minority owner of the joint venture following the completion of the proposed transaction result pfizer will not have control over the joint venture it management or it policy and we may have business interest strategy and goal that differ in certain respect from those of gsk or the joint venture the market value of our common stock may be adversely affected result of expected and unexpected cost associated with the proposed transaction and integration of the business we have incurred and expect to incur transaction and integration related cost in connection with the proposed transaction we expect that substantial portion of these transaction and integration related cost will be comprised of non recurring fee for professional service to complete the proposed transaction facility and system consolidation cost and employment related cost although certain unanticipated cost and expense may be incurred well if the stock and asset purchase agreement is terminated we would have incurred many of these cost fee and expense without realizing the expected benefit of the transaction these cost fee and expense could adversely affect our financial result other risk the global economic environmentlike all business of our size we are exposed to

on access to medicine potentially causing patient to switch to generic or biosimilar product delay treatment skip dos or use le effective treatment government financing pressure can lead to negative pricing pressure in various market where government take an active role in setting price access criterion through public or private health technology assessment or other mean of cost control example include the different eu member state japan china canada south korea and number of other international market the continues to maintain competitive insurance market but ha also seen significant increase in patient cost sharing and growing government influence government program continue to grow source of coverage the global economic environment ha not had do we anticipate that it will have material impact on our liquidity or capital resource due to our significant operating cash flow financial asset access to capital market and available line of credit and revolving credit agreement we continue to believe that we have and will maintain the ability to meet our liquidity need for the foreseeable future we monitor our liquidity position continuously in the face of evolving economic

in the future we continue to monitor credit capital restriction and economic situation in volatile region and market especially where the ability to obtain dollar for local currency is unpredictable and challenging we can not predict the likelihood of future change in these economic condition or what impact they may have on our result of operation financial condition or business in addition given

include declining sale increased cost volatility in foreign exchange rate decline in the value of our financial asset and pension plan investment required increase of our pension funding obligation increased government cost control effort delay or failure in the performance of customer supplier and other third party on whom we may depend for the performance of our business and the risk that our allowance for doubtful account may not be adequate foreign exchange and interest rate risksignificant portion of our revenue cost and expense well our substantial international net asset are exposed to change in foreign exchange rate of our total revenue were derived from international operation including from europe and from china japan and the rest of asia we operate in multiple foreign currency including the euro the japanese yen the chinese renminbi the pound the canadian dollar and approximately other currency change in those currency relative to the dollar will impact our revenue and expense if the dollar were to weaken against another currency assuming all other variable remained constant our revenue would increase having positive impact on earnings and our overall expense would increase having negative impact on earnings conversely if the dollar were to strengthen against another currency assuming all other variable remained constant our revenue would decrease having negative impact on earnings and our overall expense would decrease having positive impact on earnings therefore significant change in foreign exchange rate can impact our result and our financial
