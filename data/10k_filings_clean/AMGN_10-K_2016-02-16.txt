product or where we are developing product candidate or new indication for existing product our competitive position may be based on among other thing safety efficacy reliability availability patient convenience delivery device price reimbursement access and timing of market entry and patent position and expiration certain of the existing patent on our principal product have recently expired and we face new and increasing competition including from biosimilars we may also compete biosimilar or generic version of our competitor product biosimilar is another version of biological product for which marketing approval is sought or ha been obtained based on demonstration that it is similar to the original reference product see government regulation we expect the adverse impact from biosimilars to be more like branded biologics than generic small molecule we expect patient provider and payer to place high value on the reputation reliability and safety of biosimilars zarxio biosimilar version of neupogen from sandoz novartis company sandoz which launched in the united state on september is the first biosimilar entrant into the market company are developing biosimilar version of epogen and neulasta along with additional biosimilar version of neupogen we expect our product to continue to generate substantial sale and cash flow for year to come even after competitor enter the market we are prepared to compete and will leverage the experience that we have in the united state versus branded competition well our considerable experience competing against epoetin alfa and filgrastim biosimilars in europe the introduction of new product the development of new process or technology by competitor or the emergence of new information about existing product may result in increased competition for our marketed product even for protected by patent or in reduction of the price that we receive from selling our product in addition the development of new treatment option or standard of care may reduce the use of our product or may limit the utility and application of ongoing clinical trial for our product candidate used in this document clinical trial may include

subsidiary of takeda pharmaceutical company limited kyprolis operates in rapidly growing market in new therapeutic area where competition is changing rapidly reimbursementsales of our principal product are dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third party payer in many market around the world these payer including government health system private health insurer and other organization continue to be focused on reducing the cost of healthcare their effort have only intensified result of rising healthcare cost and economic challenge drug and specialty drug such our product remain focus for cost containment by these party government and private payer around the world are being more restrictive regarding the use of our and other biopharmaceutical product demanding greater level of clinical evidence to support the benefit such product bring to patient and the broader healthcare system recent development have intensified scrutiny of biopharmaceutical company in the united state pricing practice of biopharmaceutical company have increased public medium and government scrutiny of our entire industry such pricing practice provide greater incentive for government and private payer to limit or regulate the price of drug product and service at the same time value assessment of new technology previously used predominantly outside the united state are an impact in the healthcare environment healthcare provider and independent organization are creating their own value assessment of biopharmaceutical drug for comparison to manufacturer pricing while these organization do not set drug price seek to influence pricing and payer and provider decision making by making their assessment public these development create greater pressure on the access pricing and sale of our product in the united state healthcare provider are reimbursed for covered service and product they deliver through medicare medicaid and other government healthcare program well through private payer pharmacy are also reimbursed in similar manner for drug product they dispense we are required to provide specified rebate or discount on the product we sell to certain government funded program including medicare and medicaid which have increased over time the patient protection and affordable care act aca enacted in increased many of the mandatory discount and rebate required of and new branded prescription pharmaceutical manufacturer and importer bpd fee payable each year by and other manufacturer in addition medicare currently requires reduction to medicare payment rate to provider due to federal budget cut referred to sequestration such change have had and are expected to continue to have material adverse impact on our business further effort to reduce government healthcare program cost could also affect and our industry example of proposal that have been discussed and debated but not yet enacted include state ballot initiative designed to require pharmaceutical manufacturer to publicly report proprietary pricing information or state legislative effort to place maximum price ceiling or cap on pharmaceutical product purchased by state agency other legislative and regulatory action that would have significant impact on amgen include change to the medicare program cover and reimburses current and future drug including for patient with end stage renal disease change in the federal payment rate or new rebate requirement for covered drug and policy for payment and coverage and payment for biosimilars including the current medicare biosimilar coverage and payment policy that enable greater utilization versus the branded originator or other policy that provide easier substitution or reimbursement advantage in the private sector healthcare provider and payer remain focused on reducing healthcare cost they continue to institute various cost reduction and containment measure such more limited benefit design tiering of co pay stricter usage requirement and higher deductible benefit plan that lower healthcare cost altogether or shift greater proportion of cost to patient in the retail pharmacy sector where the majority of our sale for enbrel sensipar and repatha occur pharmacy benefit manager pbms and insurer are implementing more rigorous utilization and pricing tool that can reduce amgen product usage or revenue pbms are third party administrator of prescription drug program for large employer health plan and government program these customer known plan sponsor increasingly rely on pbms to help administer their plan in cost effective manner and negotiate contract on their behalf consolidation in the market ha resulted in three pbms overseeing approximately and three insurer overseeing approximately respectively of total covered life in the united state this ha allowed each greater market power and negotiating leverage to influence or impact patient drug usage and price in the case of pbms this can include mandating stricter utilization criterion or excluding drug from their formulary altogether in favor of competitor drug or alternative treatment formulary exclusion effectively encourages the patient and provider to seek alternative treatment or pay of the cost of the drug generally in country outside the united state government sponsored healthcare system are the primary payer for drug and biologics with increased budgetary constraint payer in many country employ variety of measure to exert downward price pressure these measure can include mandatory price control price referencing therapeutic reference pricing increasing mandate or incentive for generic substitution and biosimilar usage and government mandated price cut in addition healthcare reform and related legislative proposal have targeted the pharmaceutical sector with multiple mechanism to reduce government healthcare expenditure we expect that country will continue to take aggressive action to reduce expenditure on drug and biologics similarly fiscal constraint may also impact the extent to which country are willing to approve new innovative therapy and or allow access to new technology for example many health technology assessment hta organization use formal economic metric such cost effectiveness to determine coverage and reimbursement of new therapy and these organization are proliferating in established and emerging market these dynamic and recent development serve to create pressure on the pricing and potential usage of our product and the industry whole we remain focused on addressing unmet medical need we believe the pricing of our medicine reflects the holistic value delivered to patient provider and payer and is aligned with the investment and risk we undertake to develop medicine well fund future scientific innovation we continue to adapt to these dynamic to successfully bring our medicine to patient this includes working more closely with payer to address their concern delivering robust supporting data package and developing mutually beneficial contracting structure such we believe we can successfully deliver the value of our medicine see item risk factor our sale depend on coverage and reimbursement from third party payer and pricing and reimbursement pressure may affect our profitability and item risk factor guideline and recommendation published by various organization can reduce the use of our product distribution and raw material manufacturingthe product we manufacture include both biologics and small molecule drug the majority of our product are biologics which are produced in living cell and are inherently complex due to naturally occurring molecular variation highly specialized knowledge and extensive process and product characterization are required to transform laboratory scale process into reproducible commercial manufacturing process for additional information regarding manufacturing facility see item property we perform of our bulk manufacturing formulation fill and finish activity in our puerto rico facility and also conduct finish activity in the netherlands we also utilize third party contract manufacturer to supplement the bulk formulation fill and or packaging of certain amgen principal product including enbrel neulasta xgeva sensipar mimpara prolia well kyprolis clinical bulk formulation fill and finish manufacturing facility are operated primarily in our thousand oak california and west greenwich rhode island location we also utilize third party contract manufacturer for certain clinical product see item risk factor for discussion of the factor that could adversely impact our manufacturing operation and the global supply of our product distributionwe operate distribution center in the united state principally in kentucky and california and the netherlands for worldwide distribution of the majority of our commercial and clinical product we also use third party distributor to supplement distribution of our product worldwide otherin addition to the manufacturing and distribution activity noted our operation in the united state puerto rico and the netherlands include key manufacturing support function including quality control process development procurement production scheduling and warehousing certain of those manufacturing and distribution activity are highly regulated by the fda well other international regulatory agency see government regulation regulation of manufacturing standard manufacturing initiativeswe believe we are leader in manufacturing biologics and our manufacturing capability are competitive advantage we have multiple ongoing initiative that are designed to extend this advantage by optimizing our manufacturing network and or mitigating manufacturing risk while continuing to ensure adequate supply of our product these initiative include the licensure of new formulation and fill facility at our puerto rico site and part of risk mitigation strategy full licensure of our formulation fill and finish site in ireland to manufacture our product both of these new facility will require qualification and licensure by various regulatory authority in we initiated the drug substance conformance campaign to facilitate licensure at our monoclonal antibody manufacturing facility in singapore upon licensure this facility will expand our capability to manufacture monoclonal antibody utilizing new technology and innovation the facility will be fully reconfigurable providing efficient manufacturing capability to help ensure supply of our product worldwide we have also begun construction on an additional new facility at the site in singapore to enable the manufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for kyprolis in addition to these initiative we have project designed to optimize manufacturing asset utilization to continue our use of third party contract manufacturer and to maintain state of regulatory compliance this includes manufacturing network consolidation initiative well process improvement surrounding manufacturing see item risk factor manufacturing difficulty disruption or delay could limit supply of our product and limit our product sale raw material and medical devicescertain raw material medical device and component necessary for the commercial and or clinical manufacturing of our product are provided by and are the proprietary product of unaffiliated third party supplier certain of which may be our only source for such material we currently attempt to manage the risk associated with such supplier by inventory management relationship management and evaluation of alternative source when feasible we also monitor the financial condition of certain supplier and their ability to supply our need see item risk factor we rely on third party supplier for certain of our raw material medical device and component perform various procedure to assist in authenticating the source of raw material including intermediary material used in the manufacture of our product which include verification of the country of origin these procedure are incorporated into the manufacturing process we and our third party contract manufacturer perform government regulationregulation by government authority in the united state and other country is significant factor in the production and marketing of our product and our ongoing activity in order to clinically test manufacture and market product for therapeutic use we must satisfy mandatory procedure and safety and effectiveness standard established by various regulatory body compliance with these standard is complex and failure to comply with any of these standard can result in significant implication see item risk factor for discussion of factor that can adversely impact our development and marketing of commercial product including global regulatory implication regulation in the united statesin the united state the public health service act the federal food drug and cosmetic act fdca and the regulation promulgated thereunder well other federal and state statute and regulation govern among other thing the production research development testing manufacture quality control labeling storage record keeping approval advertising and promotion reporting of certain payment and other transfer of value and distribution of our product clinical development and product approval drug development in our industry is complex challenging and risky and failure rate are high product development cycle are typically long approximately to year from discovery to market potential new medicine must undergo many year of preclinical and clinical testing to establish it safety and efficacy for use in human at appropriate dosing level and with an acceptable risk benefit profile after laboratory analysis and preclinical testing in animal we file an investigational new drug application ind with the fda to begin human testing typically we undertake an fda designated three phase human clinical testing program in phase we conduct small clinical trial to investigate the safety and proper dose range of our product candidate in small number of human subject in phase we conduct clinical trial to investigate side effect profile and the efficacy of our product candidate in large number of patient who have the disease or condition under study in phase we conduct clinical trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of our product candidate in large number of patient who have the disease or condition under study the fda monitor the progress of each trial conducted under an ind and may at it discretion evaluate alter suspend or terminate the testing based on the data accumulated to that point and the fda risk benefit assessment with regard to the patient enrolled in the trial the result of preclinical and clinical trial are submitted to the fda in the form of bla for biologic product or an nda for small molecule product we can not market or promote new product until our marketing application ha been approved by the fda approval of biosimilars the aca authorized the fda to approve biosimilars via separate abbreviated pathway the pathway allows sponsor of biosimilar to seek and obtain regulatory approval based in part on the non clinical and clinical trial data of an originator product to which the biosimilar ha been demonstrated to be similar the relevance of demonstrating similarity is that in many case biosimilars can be brought to market without conducting the full suite of clinical trial typically required of originator risk benefit ha previously been established in order to preserve incentive for future innovation the law establishes period of exclusivity for originator product which prohibits biosimilars from gaining fda approval based in part on reliance on or reference to the originator data in their application to the fda for year after fda approval of the originator product the law not change the duration of patent granted on biologic product the fda ha released seven guidance document part of the implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilars and four of these have been finalized the fda ha announced it planned publication of additional draft guidance document relating to biosimilar interchangeability and biosimilars labeling of the end of one biosimilar application ha been approved by the fda and number of manufacturer have announced the filing of marketing application to the fda under the biosimilar pathway of which are for biosimilars of our product regulation of product marketing and promotion the fda regulates the marketing and promotion of product our product promotion for approved product indication must comply with the statutory standard of the fdca and the fda implementing regulation and standard the fda review of marketing and promotional activity encompasses but is not limited to direct to

criminal penalty or regulatory letter which may require corrective advertising or other corrective communication to healthcare professional failure to comply with the fda regulation also can result in adverse publicity or increased scrutiny of company activity by the congress or other legislator additionally described such failure may lead to additional liability under health care fraud and abuse law regulation of manufacturing standard the fda regulates and inspects equipment facility laboratory and process used in the manufacturing and testing of product prior to providing approval to market product if after receiving approval from the fda we make material change in manufacturing equipment location or process additional regulatory review may be required we also must adhere to current good manufacturing practice regulation and product specific regulation enforced by the fda through it facility inspection program the fda conduct regular periodic visit to re inspect our equipment facility laboratory and process following an initial approval regulation of combination product combination product are defined by the fda to include product comprised of two or more regulated component biologic and or drug and device biologics drug and device each have their own regulatory requirement and combination product may have additional requirement number of our marketed product meet this definition and are regulated under this framework and we expect that number of our pipeline product candidate will be evaluated for regulatory approval under this framework well regulation outside the united statesin the eu country switzerland canada australia and japan regulatory requirement and approval process are similar in principle to those in the united state in the eu depending on the type of drug for which approval is sought there are currently two potential track for marketing approval decentralized and centralized procedure in the decentralized procedure identical application for marketing authorization are submitted simultaneously to the national regulatory agency the application is assessed by an initial national agency reference member state and the subsequent country that the applicant chooses to seek approval concerned member state regulatory review is led by the reference member state and acknowledged by the concerned member state leading to single approval in all relevant country in the centralized procedure which is required of all product derived from biotechnology company submits single maa to the ema which conduct thorough product evaluation drawing from it scientific resource across europe if the drug product is proven to fulfill the requirement for quality safety and efficacy the committee for medicinal product for human use chmp adopts positive opinion which is transmitted to the ec for final approval of the marketing authorization while the ec generally follows the chmp opinion it is not bound to do subsequent commercialization is enabled by country by country reimbursement approval in japan additional local clinical trial may be required part of the drug registration process which can add to the drug registration timeline in the eu biosimilars have been approved under specialized pathway of the centralized procedure with the pathway sponsor of biosimilar may seek and obtain regulatory approval based in part on the non clinical and clinical trial data of an originator product to which the biosimilar ha been demonstrated to be similar other country such russia turkey and those in latin america and the middle east have review process and data requirement similar to those of the eu and in some case rely on prior marketing approval from or eu regulatory authority the regulatory process in these country may include manufacturing testing facility inspection testing of drug product upon importation and other domestic requirement in asia number of country such china south korea and taiwan may require local clinical trial part of the drug registration process in addition to the global clinical trial which can add to the drug registration timeline in most asian market registration timeline are dependent on marketing approval in the united state or eu however in some emerging market in asia such china the regulatory landscape is evolving and the regulatory timeline can be le predictable post approval phaseafter approval we continue to monitor adverse event reported following the use of our product through post marketing routine pharmacovigilance surveillance and study when applicable we report such event to the appropriate regulatory agency required per local regulation for individual case and aggregate report we proactively monitor according to good pharmacovigilance practice and ensure the implementation of signal detection assessment and communication of adverse event that may be associated with the use of our product we may also be required by regulatory agency to conduct further clinical trial on our marketed product condition of their approval or to provide additional information on safety and efficacy health authority including the fda have authority to mandate labeling change to product at any point in product lifecycle based on new safety information or part of an evolving label change to particular class of product authority including the fda also have the authority or after approval to require company to implement risk management program for product to ensure that the benefit of the drug outweigh the risk each risk management program is unique and varies depending on the specific factor required in the united state risk management program is known risk evaluation and mitigation strategy rem and we currently have rem for our esas prolia nplate and blincyto other regulationwe are also subject to various law pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including anti kickback law and false claim law anti kickback law make it illegal to solicit offer receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of business including the purchase or prescription of particular drug that is reimbursed by state or federal program false claim law prohibit knowingly and willingly presenting or causing to be presented for payment to third party payer including medicare and medicaid any claim for reimbursed drug or service that are false or fraudulent claim for item or service not provided claimed or claim for medically unnecessary item or service violation of fraud and abuse law may be punishable by criminal and or civil sanction including fine and civil monetary penalty well the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare program including medicare and medicaid liability under the false claim law may also arise when violation of certain law or regulation related to the underlying product for example violation regarding improper promotional activity or unlawful payment contributes to the submission of false claim on december amgen announced that it had finalized settlement agreement with the government and various other party regarding allegation that amgen promotional contracting sale and marketing activity and arrangement caused the submission of various false claim under the federal civil false claim act and various state false claim act in connection with entering into the settlement agreement amgen also entered into corporate integrity agreement with the office of inspector general oig of the department of health and human service that requires amgen to maintain it corporate compliance program and to undertake set of defined corporate integrity obligation for period of five year due to the breadth of the statutory provision and the absence of guidance in the form of regulation or court decision addressing some of our practice it is possible that in the future our practice might be further challenged under anti kickback or similar law additionally the foreign corrupt practice act fcpa prohibits corporation and their representative from offering promising authorizing or making payment to any foreign government official government staff member political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad the scope of the fcpa includes interaction with certain healthcare professional in many country other country have enacted similar anti corruption law and or regulation our business ha been and will continue to be subject to various other and foreign law rule and or regulation and development and selected product candidateswe focus our on novel human therapeutic for the treatment of serious illness in the area of oncology hematology cardiovascular disease inflammation bone health nephrology and neuroscience we take modality independent approach to with focus on biologics our discovery research program may therefore yield target that lead to the development of human therapeutic delivered large molecule small molecule or other combination or new modality for the year ended december and our expense billion billion and billion respectively we have major center in several location throughout the united state including thousand oak and san francisco california and cambridge massachusetts iceland and in the united kingdom well smaller research center and development facility globally see item property we conduct clinical trial activity using both our internal staff and third party contract clinical trial service provider to increase the number of patient available for enrollment in our clinical trial we have opened clinical site and will continue to open clinical site and to enroll patient in number of geographic location see government regulation clinical development and product approval for discussion of government regulation over clinical development also see item risk factor we must conduct clinical trial in human before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidate or existing product for new indication some of our competitor are actively engaged in in area where we have product or where we are developing product candidate or new indication for existing product for example we compete with other clinical trial for eligible patient which may limit the number of available patient who meet the criterion for certain clinical trial the competitive marketplace for our product candidate is significantly dependent on the timing of entry into the market early entry may have important advantage in gaining product acceptance thereby contributing to the product eventual success and profitability accordingly we expect that in some case the relative speed with which we can develop product complete clinical testing receive regulatory approval and supply commercial quantity of the product to the market will be important to our competitive position in addition to product candidate and marketed product generated from our internal effort we acquire company acquire and license certain product and technology right and establish arrangement with third party to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our capability product pipeline and marketed product base in pursuing these arrangement and licensing or acquisition activity we face competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology company that also seek to

other information about is available on our website at www amgen com we make available on our website free of charge copy of our annual report on form quarterly report on form current report on form and amendment to those report filed or furnished pursuant to section or of the exchange act soon reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish it to the security and exchange commission sec in addition we have previously filed registration statement and other document with the sec any document we file may be inspected without charge at the sec public reference

website is not intended to be part of this filing information related to the operation of the sec public reference room may be obtained by calling the sec at sec item risk factorsthis report and other document we file with the sec contain forward looking statement that are based on current expectation estimate forecast and projection about our future performance our business our belief and our management assumption these statement are not guarantee of future performance and involve certain risk uncertainty and assumption that are difficult to predict should carefully consider the risk and uncertainty facing our business the risk described below are not the only one facing our business is also subject to the risk that affect many other company such employment relation general economic condition geopolitical event and international operation further additional risk not currently known to or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business operation liquidity and stock price our sale depend on coverage and reimbursement from third party payer and pricing and reimbursement pressure may affect our profitability sale of our principal product are dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third party payer including government healthcare program and private insurance plan government and private payer continue to pursue aggressive initiative to contain cost and manage drug utilization and are increasingly focused on the effectiveness benefit and cost of similar treatment which could result in lower reimbursement rate for our product or narrower population for whom our product will be reimbursed by payer public scrutiny of the price of drug and other healthcare cost is increasing and more control over pricing could hurt our ability to price our product based upon their value substantial portion of our business relies on reimbursement from the federal government healthcare program and private insurance plan regulated by the federal government see item business reimbursement change to federal reimbursement policy may come through legislative action such the aca or result of regulation implemented by the center for medicare medicaid service cm the federal agency responsible for administering medicare medicaid and the health insurance marketplace cm ha substantial power to quickly implement policy change that can significantly affect how our product are covered and reimbursed legislative or regulatory change that decrease the coverage or reimbursement available for our product require that we pay increased rebate limit our ability to offer patient co pay payment assistance or limit the pricing of pharmaceutical product could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation private payer including healthcare insurer pbms and others increasingly seek price discount or rebate in connection with the placement of our product on their formulary or those they manage consolidation in the health insurance industry ha resulted few large insurer and pbms exerting greater pressure in pricing and usage negotiation with drug manufacturer insurer and others are adopting benefit plan change that shift greater portion of prescription cost to patient and some payer may attempt to limit the use of patient co pay payment assistance program private payer also control cost by imposing restriction on access to our product such requiring prior authorization or step therapy and may even choose to exclude coverage entirely such discount rebate plan change restriction or exclusion could have material adverse effect on sale of our affected product we also face risk relating to the reporting of pricing data that affect the reimbursement of and discount provided for our product to government healthcare program pricing data that we submit impact the payment rate for provider rebate we pay and discount we are required to provide under medicare medicaid and other government drug program government price reporting regulation are complex and may require manufacturer to update certain previously submitted data our price reporting data calculation are reviewed on monthly and quarterly basis and based on such review we have on occasion restated previously reported pricing data to reflect change in calculation methodology reasonable assumption and or underlying data if our submitted pricing data are incorrect we may become subject to substantial fine and penalty or other government enforcement action which could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation in addition result of restating previously reported price data we also may be required to pay additional rebate and provide additional discount outside the united state we expect that country will continue to take aggressive action to reduce their healthcare expenditure see item business reimbursement for example international reference pricing irp is widely used by large number of country to control cost based on an external benchmark of product price in other country irp policy can quickly and frequently change and may not reflect difference in the burden of disease indication market structure or affordability difference across country or region any deterioration in the coverage and reimbursement available for our product or in the timeliness or certainty of payment by payer to physician and other provider could negatively impact the ability or willingness of healthcare provider to prescribe our product for their patient or otherwise negatively affect the use of our product or the price we receive for them such change could have material adverse effect on our product sale business and result of operation our product face substantial competition we operate in highly competitive environment see item business competition we expect that our product will compete with new drug currently in development drug currently approved for other indication that may later be approved for the same indication those of our product and drug approved for other indication that are used label large pharmaceutical company and generic manufacturer of pharmaceutical product are expanding into the biotechnology field and some pharmaceutical company and generic manufacturer have formed partnership to pursue biosimilars in addition some of our competitor may have technical competitive or other advantage over for the development of technology and process or greater experience in particular therapeutic area and consolidation among pharmaceutical and biotechnology company can enhance such advantage these advantage may make it difficult for to compete with them to successfully discover develop and market new product and for our current product to compete with new product or new product indication that they may bring to market result our product may compete against product that have lower price equivalent or superior performance better safety profile are easier to administer reach the market before our product or that are otherwise competitive with our product if we are unable to compete effectively this could reduce sale which could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation we currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition in the future we currently face competition from biosimilars in both europe and the united state and we expect to face increasing biosimilar competition in the future to the extent that government adopt more permissive approval framework and competitor are able to obtain broader or expedited marketing approval for biosimilars the rate of increased competition for our product could accelerate expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent right could trigger such competition and we could face more litigation regarding the validity and or scope of our patent our product may also experience greater competition from lower cost biosimilars or generic that come to market when branded product that compete with our product lose their own patent protection in the eu the ec ha granted marketing authorization for biosimilars pursuant to set of general and product class specific guideline for biosimilar approval issued in in addition in an effort to spur biosimilar utilization and or increase potential healthcare saving some eu country have adopted biosimilar uptake measure such requiring physician prescribing quota or promoting switching or pharmacy substitution of biosimilars for the corresponding reference product and other country may adopt similar measure some eu country may impose automatic price reduction upon market entry of the second or third biosimilar competitor the united state in the aca authorized the fda to approve biosimilars via separate abbreviated pathway see item business government regulation regulation in the united state approval of biosimilars the first biosimilar entrant into the market zarxio biosimilar version of neupogen from sandoz wa launched in the united state in in addition growing number of company have announced that they are in varying stage of development of biosimilar version of existing biotechnology product including biosimilars that would compete with our product some company pursuing development of biosimilars version of our product may challenge our patent well in advance of the expiration of our material patent see our intellectual property position may be challenged invalidated or circumvented or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation for example in june sandoz filed suit against seeking declaratory judgment that the etanercept product it wa developing biosimilar to enbrel not infringe certain of our patent and that those patent were also invalid and unenforceable while that suit wa dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction sandoz had not yet filed marketing application with the fda sandoz subsequently announced that it marketing application ha now been accepted for review by the fda for information related to our other biosimilars patent litigation see part iv note contingency and commitment to the consolidated financial statement the pathway includes the option for biosimilar product meeting certain criterion to be approved interchangeable with their reference product some company currently developing biosimilars may seek to register their product interchangeable biologics which could make it easier for prescribers or pharmacist to substitute those biosimilars for our product in addition critic of the year exclusivity period in the biosimilar pathway law will likely continue to seek to shorten the data exclusivity period and or to encourage the fda to interpret narrowly the law provision regarding which new product receive data exclusivity while we are unable to predict the precise impact of biosimilars on our product we expect in the future to face greater competition in the united state result of biosimilars and downward pressure on our product price and sale this additional competition could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation our current product and product in development can not be sold without regulatory approval our business is subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal governmental authority in the united state including the fda and by foreign regulatory authority including the ema we are required in the united state and in foreign country to obtain approval from regulatory authority before we can manufacture market and sell our product once approved the fda and other and foreign regulatory agency have substantial authority to require additional testing and reporting perform inspection change product labeling or mandate withdrawal of our product failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirement may subject to administrative and or judicially imposed sanction the sanction could include the fda or foreign regulatory authority refusal to approve pending application delay in obtaining or withdrawal of approval delay or suspension of clinical trial warning letter product recall product seizure total or partial suspension of our operation injunction fine civil penalty and or criminal prosecution obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval ha been and will continue to be increasingly difficult time consuming and costly legislative body or regulatory agency could enact new law or regulation change existing law or regulation or change their interpretation of law or regulation at any time which could affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our product or product candidate the rate and degree of change in existing law and regulation and regulatory expectation have accelerated in established market and regulatory expectation continue to evolve in emerging market failure to comply with new law regulation or regulatory interpretation could result in significant monetary penalty well reputational and other harm we are unable to predict when and whether any further change to law or regulatory policy affecting our business could occur such effort to reform medical device regulation or the pedigree requirement for medical product or to implement new requirement for combination product and whether such change could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation regulatory authority may also question the sufficiency for approval of the endpoint we select for our clinical trial number of our product and product candidate have been evaluated in clinical trial using surrogate endpoint that measure an effect that is known to correlate with an ultimate clinical endpoint for example therapeutic oncology product candidate may be evaluated for it ability to extend the length of time during and after the treatment that patient life without the disease worsening progression free survival or pfs demonstrating that the product candidate produce statistically significant improvement in pfs doe not necessarily mean that the product candidate will show statistically significant improvement in the time that the patient remain alive in the cardiovascular setting heart disease therapeutic candidate may be evaluated for it ability to reduce ldl level elevated ldl level ha been surrogate endpoint for cardiovascular event such death heart attack and stroke the use of surrogate endpoint such pfs and ldl reduction in the absence of other measure of clinical benefit may not be sufficient for broad usage or approval even when such result are statistically significant regulatory authority could also add new requirement such the completion of enrollment in confirmatory study or the completion of an outcome study or meaningful portion of an outcome study condition for obtaining approval or obtaining an indication for example our initial fda application for repatha sought approval for broader patient population based on data demonstrating that repatha reduced ldl level however the fda ultimately approved repatha only for subset of those patient citing among other thing the absence of positive outcome data showing that repatha prevents cardiovascular event while our phase study is evaluating the ability of repatha to prevent cardiovascular event that study may fail to meet it clinical efficacy endpoint or may identify safety issue with the product see we must conduct clinical trial in human before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidate or existing product for new indication even if the ongoing outcome study meet it clinical endpoint regulator may not approve repatha for use beyond the currently approved label indication there may also be situation in which demonstrating the efficacy and safety of product candidate may not be sufficient to gain regulatory approval unless superiority to comparative product can be shown the imposition of additional requirement or our inability to meet them in timely fashion or at all may delay our clinical development and regulatory filing effort delay or prevent from obtaining regulatory approval for new product candidate or new indication for existing product or prevent from maintaining our current label some of our product have been approved by and foreign regulatory authority on conditional basis with full approval conditioned upon fulfilling the requirement of regulator for example in december we received accelerated approval for blincyto for the treatment of patient with ph relapsed or refractory cell precursor all in the united state with continued approval contingent upon clinical benefit in subsequent trial blincyto also received conditional marketing authorization for the treatment of patient with ph relapsed or refractory cell precursor all from the ec in november regulatory authority are placing greater focus on monitoring product originally approved on an accelerated or conditional basis and on whether the sponsor of such product have met the condition of the accelerated or conditional approval if we are unable to fulfill the requirement of regulator that were condition of product accelerated or conditional approval and or if regulator re evaluate the data or risk benefit profile of our product our conditional approval may not result in full approval or may be revoked or not renewed alternatively we may be required to change the product labeled indication or even withdraw the product from the market safety problem or signal can arise our product and product candidate are evaluated in clinical trial including investigator sponsored study or our marketed product are used in clinical practice we are required to continuously collect and ass adverse event reported to and to communicate to regulatory agency these adverse event and safety signal regarding our product regulatory agency periodically perform inspection of our pharmacovigilance process including our adverse event reporting in pharmacovigilance legislation became effective in the eu that enhanced the authority of european regulator to require company to conduct additional post approval clinical efficacy and safety study and increased the requirement on sponsor company to analyze and evaluate the risk benefit profile of their product similarly for our product with approved rem see item business government regulation post approval phase we are required to submit periodic assessment report to the fda to demonstrate that the goal of the rem are being met rem and other risk management program are designed to ensure that drug benefit outweigh the risk and vary in the element they contain for example our esa rem requires applicable healthcare provider and institution to enroll in the program receive education about the product and the rem and document and report certain information to over time we are responsible for tracking and documenting certain element of healthcare provider and institution compliance with the esa rem and we use third party service provider to assist in the administration of certain portion of our rem if the fda is not satisfied with the result of the periodic assessment report we submit for any of our rem the fda may also modify our rem or take other regulatory action such implementing revised or restrictive labeling if regulatory agency determine that we or other party including our clinical trial investigator those operating our patient support program or licensee of our product have not complied with the applicable reporting or other pharmacovigilance requirement we may become subject to additional inspection warning letter or other enforcement action including monetary fine marketing authorization withdrawal and other penalty our product candidate and marketed product can also be affected by safety problem or signal occurring with respect to product that are similar to and that implicate an entire class of product further result of clinical trial including sub analysis or meta analysis of earlier clinical trial meta analysis involves the use of various statistical method to combine result from previous separate but related study performed by or others concern may arise about the sufficiency of the data or study underlying product approved label such actual or perceived safety problem or concern can lead to revised or restrictive labeling for our product or the potential for restrictive labeling that may result in our decision not to commercialize product candidate requirement of risk management activity or other regulatory agency compliance action related to the promotion and sale of our product mandated post marketing commitment or pharmacovigilance program for our approved product product recall of our approved product revocation of approval for our product from the market completely or within particular therapeutic area or patient type increased timeline or delay in being approved by the fda or other regulatory body and or fewer treatment or product candidate being approved by regulatory body example since when adverse safety result involving esas were observed esas continue to be the subject of ongoing review and scrutiny review by regulatory authority of the risk benefit profile of esas ha resulted in and may continue to result in change to esa labeling our esa rem and usage in both the oncology and nephrology clinical setting in addition to our innovative product we are working to develop and commercialize biosimilar version of nine product currently manufactured marketed and sold by other pharmaceutical company in many market there is not yet legislative or regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars in the united state the aca provided for such pathway while the fda continues to implement it significant question remain to how product will be approved under the pathway see we currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition in the future delay or uncertainty in the development of such pathway could result in delay or difficulty in getting our product approved by regulatory authority subject to unanticipated development cost or otherwise reduce the value of the investment we have made in the biosimilars area we may not be able to develop commercial product despite significant investment in amgen invests heavily in successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain and very few project produce commercial product product candidate including biosimilar product candidate or new indication for existing product collectively product candidate that appear promising in the early phase of development may fail to reach the market for number of reason such the product candidate did not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial result even though it demonstrated positive preclinical trial result for reason that could include change in the standard of care of medicine the product candidate wa not effective or more effective than currently available therapy in treating specified condition or illness the product candidate is not cost effective in light of existing therapeutic the product candidate had harmful side effect in human or animal the necessary regulatory body such the fda or ema did not approve our product candidate for an intended use the product candidate wa not economical for to manufacture and commercialize the biosimilar product candidate fails to demonstrate the requisite biosimilarity to the applicable reference product or is otherwise determined to be unacceptable for purpose of safety or efficacy to gain approval other party have or may have proprietary right relating to our product candidate such patent right and will not let sell it on reasonable term or at all we and certain of our licensee partner or independent investigator may fail to effectively conduct clinical development or clinical manufacturing activity and the pathway to regulatory approval or reimbursement for product candidate is uncertain or not well defined number of our product candidate have failed or been discontinued at various stage in the product development process for example in may we terminated our participation in the co development and commercialization of brodalumab with astrazeneca the decision wa based on event of suicidal ideation and behavior in the brodalumab program which we believe likely would necessitate restrictive labeling that would limit the appropriate patient population inability to bring product to market or significant delay in the expected approval and related launch date of new product for any of the reason discussed could potentially have negative impact on our product sale and earnings and could result in significant impairment of in process research and development ipr or other intangible asset we must conduct clinical trial in human before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidate or existing product for new indication before we can sell any product we must conduct clinical trial to demonstrate that our product candidate are safe and effective for use in human the result of those clinical trial are used the basis to obtain approval from regulatory authority such the fda and ema see our current product and product in development can not be sold without regulatory approval we are required to conduct clinical trial using an appropriate number of trial site and patient to support the product label claim the length of time number of trial site and patient required for clinical trial vary substantially and therefore we may spend several year and incur substantial expense in completing certain clinical trial in addition we may have difficulty finding sufficient number of clinical trial site and subject to participate in our clinical trial particularly if competitor are conducting clinical trial in similar patient population delay in planned clinical trial can result in increased development cost associated delay in regulatory approval and in product candidate reaching the market and revision to existing product label to increase the number of patient available for enrollment for our clinical trial we have and will continue to open clinical site and enroll patient in number of location where our experience conducting clinical trial is limited including russia india china south korea the philippine singapore and some central and south american country either through utilization of third party contract clinical trial provider entirely or in combination with local staff conducting clinical trial in location where we have limited experience requires substantial time and resource to understand the unique regulatory environment of individual country further we must ensure the timely production distribution and delivery of the clinical supply of our product candidate to numerous and varied clinical trial site if we fail to adequately manage the design execution and diverse regulatory aspect of our large and complex clinical trial or to manage the production or distribution of our clinical supply corresponding regulatory approval may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our product candidate or could lose our ability to market existing product in certain therapeutic area or altogether if we are unable to market and sell our product or product candidate or to obtain approval in the timeframe needed to execute our product strategy our business and result of operation could be materially and adversely affected we rely on independent third party clinical investigator to recruit subject and conduct clinical trial on our behalf in accordance with the applicable study protocol and law and regulation further we rely on unaffiliated third party vendor to perform certain aspect of our clinical trial operation we also may acquire company that have ongoing clinical trial these trial may not be conducted to the same standard ours however once an acquisition ha been completed we assume responsibility for the conduct of the trial including any potential risk and liability associated with the past and prospective conduct of those trial if regulatory authority determine that we or others including our licensee or the independent investigator selected by or by company we have acquired have not complied with regulation applicable to the clinical trial those authority may refuse or reject some or all of the clinical trial data or take other action which could negatively impact our ability to obtain or maintain marketing approval of the product or indication if we were unable to market and sell our product or product candidate our business and result of operation could be materially and adversely affected in addition some of our clinical trial involve drug manufactured and marketed by other pharmaceutical company these drug may be administered in clinical trial in combination with one of our product or product candidate or in head to head study comparing the product or product candidate relative efficacy and safety in the event that any of these vendor or pharmaceutical company have unforeseen issue that negatively impact the quality of their work or create shortage of supply or if we are otherwise unable to obtain an adequate supply of these other drug our ability to complete our applicable clinical trial and or evaluate clinical result may also be negatively impacted result this could adversely affect our ability to timely file for gain or maintain regulatory approval worldwide clinical trial must be designed based on the current standard of medical care however in certain disease such cancer the standard of care is evolving rapidly in these disease the duration of time needed to complete certain clinical trial may result in the design of such clinical trial being based on standard of medical care that are no longer the current standard by the time such trial are completed limiting the utility and application of such trial we may not obtain favorable clinical trial result and therefore may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for new product candidate new indication for existing product or maintenance of our current product label participant in clinical trial of our product and product candidate may also suffer adverse medical event or side effect that could among other factor delay or terminate the clinical trial program and or require additional or longer trial to gain approval even after product is on the market safety concern may require additional or more extensive clinical trial part of risk management plan for our product or for approval of new indication for example in connection with the june esa label change we also agreed to conduct additional clinical trial examining the use of esas in ckd additional clinical trial we initiate including those required by the fda could result in substantial additional expense and the outcome could result in additional label restriction or the loss of regulatory approval for an approved indication each of which could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation additionally any negative result from such trial could materially affect the extent of approval the use reimbursement and sale of our product our business and result of operation some of our product are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic device which have their own regulatory manufacturing and other risk many of our product and product candidate may be used in combination with drug delivery device such an injector or other delivery system in addition vectibix is used in combination with test kit which is companion diagnostic device and some of our product candidate may also be used in combination with companion diagnostic device our product candidate or expanded indication of our product used with such device may not be approved or may be substantially delayed in receiving regulatory approval if such device do not gain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance where approval of the product and device is sought under single marketing drug application the increased complexity of the review process may also delay receipt of regulatory approval in addition some of these device may be provided by single source unaffiliated third party company we are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of those third party company both to supply the device and in some case to conduct the study required for approval or clearance by the applicable regulatory agency we are also dependent on third party company continuing to meet applicable regulatory or other requirement failure to successfully develop or supply the device delay in or failure of the amgen or third party study or failure of amgen or the third party company to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance of the device could result in increased development cost delay in or failure to obtain regulatory approval and or associated delay in product candidate reaching the market or the addition of new indication for existing product loss of regulatory approval or clearance of device that is used with our product may also result in the removal of our product from the market further failure to successfully develop supply or gain or maintain approval for these device could adversely affect sale of the related approved product our intellectual property position may be challenged invalidated or circumvented or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent right and other intellectual property right that are important to the commercialization of our product and product candidate the patent position of pharmaceutical and biotechnology company can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal scientific and factual question third party may challenge invalidate or circumvent our patent and patent application relating to our product product candidate and technology challenge to patent may come from potential competitor or from party other than those who seek to market potentially infringing product for example texas hedge fund acting with affiliated entity and individual and proceeding under the name of the coalition for affordable drug ha sought to challenge dozen of patent held by pharmaceutical and biotechnology company including one of the patent we hold for enbrel in addition our patent position might not protect against competitor with similar product or technology competing product or technology may not infringe our patent for certain of our product candidate there are third party who have patent or pending patent application that they may claim necessitate payment of royalty or prevent from commercializing these product candidate in certain territory patent dispute are frequent costly and can preclude delay or increase the cost of commercialization of product we have been in the past and are currently and may be in the future involved in patent litigation these matter have included and may in the future include litigation with manufacturer of product that purport to be biosimilars of certain of our product for patent infringement and for failure to comply with certain provision of the biologics price competition and innovation act including the requirement to provide day notice in advance of commercial marketing determination made by court agency or tribunal concerning infringement validity enforceability injunctive or economic remedy or the right to patent protection for example are typically subject to appellate or administrative review upon review such initial determination may be afforded little or no deference by the reviewing tribunal and may be affirmed reversed or made the subject of reconsideration through further proceeding patent dispute or litigation may not discourage potential violator from bringing the product that is alleged to infringe to market prior to final resolution of the dispute or litigation the period of time from inception until resolution of patent dispute or litigation is subject to the availability and schedule of the court agency or tribunal before which the dispute or litigation is pending we may be subject to competition during this period and may not be able to fully recover for the loss damage and harm we incur from infringement by the competitor product even if we prevail moreover if we lose or settle current or future litigation at certain stage or entirely we could be subject to competition and or significant liability be required to enter into third party license for the infringed product or technology or be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute in addition we can not guarantee that such license will be available on term acceptable to or at all further under the hatch waxman act our product approved by the fda under the fdca may be the subject of patent litigation with generic competitor before expiry of the five year period of data exclusivity provided for under the hatch waxman act and prior to the expiration of the patent listed for the product likewise our innovative biologic product may be the subject of patent litigation prior to the expiration of our patent and with respect to competitor seeking approval biosimilar or interchangeable version of our product prior to the year exclusivity period provided under the aca in addition we may face additional patent litigation involving claim that the biosimilar product candidate we are working to develop infringe the patent of other company that manufacture market or sell the applicable reference product while we may attempt to challenge such patent our effort may be unsuccessful certain of the existing patent on our principal product have recently expired see item business marketing distribution and selected marketed product patent our patent expire competitor are able to legally produce and market similar product or technology including biosimilars which may have material adverse effect on our affected product sale business and result of operation in addition competitor may be able to invalidate design around or otherwise circumvent our patent and sell competing product guideline and recommendation published by various organization can reduce the use of our product government agency promulgate regulation and guideline directly applicable to and to our product however professional society practice management group insurance carrier physician group private health science foundation and organization involved in various disease also publish guideline and recommendation to healthcare provider administrator and payer and patient community recommendation by government agency or other group organization may relate to such matter usage dosage route of administration and use of related therapy and growing number of organization are providing of the value and pricing of pharmaceutical product these assessment may come from private organization such the institute for clinical and economic review who publish their finding and offer recommendation relating to the product reimbursement by government and private payer in addition government hta organization such the national institute for health and clinical excellence in the united kingdom uk and the canadian agency for drug and technology in health make reimbursement recommendation to payer in their jurisdiction based on the clinical effectiveness cost effectiveness and service impact of new emerging and existing medicine and treatment any recommendation or guideline that result in decreased use dosage or reimbursement of our product could have material adverse effect on our product sale business and result of operation in addition the perception by the investment community or stockholder that such recommendation or guideline will result in decreased use and dosage of our product could adversely affect the market price for our common stock the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liability could affect our profitability we are subject to income and other tax in the united state and other jurisdiction in which we do business result our provision for income tax is derived from combination of applicable tax rate in the various place we operate significant judgment is required for determining our provision for income tax and our tax return are periodically examined by various tax authority we believe our accrual for income tax liability is appropriate based on past experience interpretation of tax law and judgment about potential action by tax authority however due to the complexity of the provision for income tax the ultimate resolution of any tax matter may result in payment greater or le than amount accrued our provision for income tax and result of operation in the future could be adversely affected by change to our operating structure change in the mix of income and expense in country with differing tax rate change in the valuation of deferred tax asset and liability and change in applicable tax law regulation or administrative interpretation thereof change to the tax system such change to the taxation of income earned outside the united state including credit allowed for foreign tax change to the tax system in jurisdiction where we have significant operation such puerto rico or change in tax law in the united state or other jurisdiction where we do business could have material and adverse effect on our business and on the result of our operation we rely on third party supplier for certain of our raw material medical device and component we rely on unaffiliated third party supplier for certain raw material medical device and component necessary for the manufacturing of our commercial and clinical product certain of those raw material medical device and component are the proprietary product of those unaffiliated third party supplier and are specifically cited in our drug application with regulatory agency so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source or source and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the regulatory agency approved such supplier for example insulet corporation is our single source of the on body injector for our neulasta onpro kit also certain of the raw material required in the commercial and clinical manufacturing of our product are sourced from other country and or derived from biological source including mammalian tissue bovine serum and human serum albumin among the reason we may be unable to obtain these raw material medical device and component include regulatory requirement or action by regulatory agency or others adverse financial or other strategic development at or affecting the supplier including bankruptcy unexpected demand for or shortage of raw material medical device or component failure to comply with our quality standard which result in quality and product failure product contamination and or recall material shortage contamination recall and or restriction on the use of certain biologically derived substance or other raw material discovery of previously unknown or undetected imperfection in raw material medical device or component and labor dispute or shortage including the effect of health emergency natural disaster or otherwise these event could negatively impact our ability to satisfy demand for our product which could have material adverse effect on our product use and sale and our business and result of operation for example in prior year we have experienced shortage in certain component necessary for the formulation fill and finish of certain of our product in our puerto rico facility further quality issue which result in unexpected additional demand for certain component may lead to shortage of required raw material or component such we have experienced with epogen glass vial we may experience or continue to experience these or other shortage in the future resulting in delayed shipment supply constraint contract dispute and or stock out of our product difficulty disruption or delay could limit supply of our product and limit our product sale manufacturing biologic human therapeutic product is difficult complex and highly regulated we currently are involved in the manufacture of many of our product and plan to manufacture many of our product candidate in addition we currently use third party contract manufacturer to produce or assist in the production of number of our product and are using contract manufacturer to produce or assist in the production of number of our late stage product candidate and drug delivery device see item business manufacturing distribution and raw material manufacturing our ability to adequately and timely manufacture and supply our product and product candidate is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our facility and those of our third party contract manufacturer which may be impacted by capacity of manufacturing facility contamination by microorganism or virus or foreign particle from the manufacturing process natural or other disaster including hurricane earthquake volcano or fire labor dispute or shortage including the effect of health emergency natural disaster or otherwise compliance with regulatory requirement change in forecast of future demand timing and actual number of production run and production success rate and yield update of manufacturing specification contractual dispute with our supplier and contract manufacturer timing and outcome of product quality testing power failure and or other utility failure and or breakdown failure or substandard performance or improper installation or operation of equipment if the efficient manufacture and supply of our product or product candidate is interrupted we may experience delayed shipment delay in our clinical trial supply constraint stock out adverse event trend contract dispute and or recall of our product from time to time we have initiated voluntary recall of certain lot of our product for example in july we initiated voluntary recall of an aranesp lot distributed in the eu after particle were detected in quality control sample following distribution of that lot if we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of our product to patient we may lose patient and physician may elect to prescribe competing therapeutic instead of our product which could have material adverse effect on our product sale business and result of operation our manufacturing process and those of our third party contract manufacturer must undergo regulatory approval process and are subject to continued review by the fda and other regulatory authority it can take longer than five year to build validate and license new manufacturing plant and it can take longer than three year to qualify and license new contract manufacturer in we initiated the drug substance conformance campaign to facilitate licensure at our monoclonal antibody manufacturing facility in singapore this singapore facility will utilize novel manufacturing technology that ha not been previously approved by the fda or other regulatory authority we have also begun construction on an additional new facility at the site in singapore to enable the manufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for kyprolis these facility in singapore will require licensure by various regulatory authority if we are unable to obtain needed license for either of these facility on timely basis it could adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned risk mitigation and cost reduction which result could have material adverse effect our product sale business and result of operation if regulatory authority determine that we or our third party contract manufacturer or certain of our third party service provider have violated regulation or if they restrict suspend or revoke our prior approval they could prohibit from manufacturing our product or conducting clinical trial or selling our marketed product until we or the affected third party contract manufacturer or third party service provider comply or indefinitely such issue may also delay the approval of product candidate we have submitted for regulatory review even if such product candidate are not directly related to the product device or process at issue with regulator because our third party contract manufacturer and certain of our third party service provider are subject to the fda and foreign regulatory authority alternative qualified third party contract manufacturer and third party service provider may not be available on timely basis or at all if we or our third party contract manufacturer or third party service provider cease or interrupt production or if our third party contract manufacturer and third party service provider fail to supply material product or service to we may experience delayed shipment supply constraint stock out and or recall of our product additionally we distribute substantial volume of our commercial product through our primary distribution center in louisville kentucky for the united state and in breda the netherlands for europe and much of the rest of the world we also conduct all the labeling and packaging of our product distributed in europe and much of the rest of the world in breda ability to timely supply product is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our distribution and logistics center our third party logistics provider and our labeling and packaging facility in breda further we rely on commercial transportation including air freight for the distribution of our product to our customer which may be negatively impacted by natural disaster or security threat we perform substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activity at our puerto rico manufacturing facility and substantial amount of our clinical manufacturing activity at our thousand oak california manufacturing facility if significant disruption or production failure occur at the puerto rico facility we may not be able to supply these product or at the thousand oak facility we may not be able to continue our clinical trial we currently perform all of the formulation fill and finish for neupogen aranesp epogen prolia and xgeva and substantially all of the formulation fill and finish operation for neulasta and enbrel at our manufacturing facility in junco puerto rico we also currently perform all of the bulk manufacturing for neulasta neupogen and aranesp all of the purification of bulk epogen material and substantially all of the bulk manufacturing for prolia and xgeva at this facility we perform substantially all of the bulk manufacturing and formulation fill and finish and packaging for product candidate to be used in clinical trial at our manufacturing facility in thousand oak california the global supply of our product and product candidate is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these facility see manufacturing difficulty disruption or delay could limit supply of our product and limit our product sale in june puerto rico governor stated that the puerto rico government which includes certain government entity is unable to pay it roughly billion in debt and since that time puerto rico failed to make certain debt payment in september the puerto rico government released fiscal and economic growth plan fegp proposal for economic growth and reform measure that also included recommendation for debt restructuring due to deteriorating liquidity position the governor issued an executive order in december providing for certain extraordinary liquidity measure such deferral of tax refund stretching of payment to supplier and the implementation of clawback of revenue assigned to certain government entity in order to make payment on general obligation bond and provide essential government service on january the puerto rico government revised the fegp to reflect larger government financing gap in the near and long term well the government deteriorating liquidity position the puerto rico government is currently in negotiation with creditor to restructure the government debt and litigation ha commenced with certain bond insurer over failure to make certain debt payment if the puerto rico government is not able to restructure the debt obligation or get forbearance on debt payment it could impact the territorial government provision of utility or other service in puerto rico that we use in the operation of our business create the potential for increased tax or fee to operate in puerto rico result in migration of worker from puerto rico to the mainland united state and make it more expensive or difficult for to operate in puerto rico concentration of sale at certain of our wholesaler distributor and consolidation of free standing dialysis clinic business may negatively impact our business the substantial majority of our product sale is made to three pharmaceutical product wholesaler distributor amerisourcebergen corporation cardinal health inc and mckesson corporation these distributor in turn sell our product to their customer which include physician or their clinic dialysis center hospital and pharmacy one of our product epogen is sold primarily to free standing dialysis clinic which have experienced significant consolidation two organization davita and fresenius medical care north america fresenius own or manage large number of the outpatient dialysis facility located in the united state and account for approximately of all epogen sale due to this concentration these entity have substantial purchasing leverage which may put pressure on our pricing by their potential ability to extract price discount on our product or fee for other service correspondingly negatively impacting our bargaining position and profit margin in addition decision by these entity to purchase le or none of our product in favor of competitive product can have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation due to their purchasing volume we may not be able to access the capital and credit market on term that are favorable to or at all the capital and credit market may experience extreme volatility and disruption which may lead to uncertainty and liquidity issue for both borrower and investor we expect to access the capital market to supplement our existing fund and cash generated from operation in satisfying our need for working capital capital expenditure and debt service requirement our plan to pay dividend and repurchase stock and other business initiative we plan to strategically pursue including acquisition and licensing activity in the event of adverse capital and credit market condition we may be unable to obtain capital market financing on similar favorable term or at all which could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation change in credit rating issued by nationally recognized credit rating agency could adversely affect our ability to obtain capital market financing and the cost of such financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our security effort to acquire other company or product and to integrate their operation may not be successful and may result in cost delay or failure to realize the benefit of the transaction we have an ongoing process of evaluating potential merger acquisition partnering and in license opportunity that we expect will contribute to our future growth and expand our geographic footprint product offering and or our pipeline acquisition may result in unanticipated cost delay or other operational or financial problem related to integrating the acquired company and business with our company which may result in the diversion of our management attention from other business issue and opportunity failure or difficulty in integrating or retaining new personnel or in integrating the operation of the business that we acquire including their technology compliance program distribution and general business operation and procedure while preserving important distribution marketing promotion and other relationship may affect our ability to grow and may result in incurring asset impairment or restructuring charge for example on october we acquired onyx biopharmaceutical company with several currently marketed product well pipeline candidate progressing through the development process and failure or difficulty in the integration of onyx could result in material adverse impact on our business and result of operation our sale and operation are subject to the risk of business in emerging market we continue our expansion effort in emerging market around the world through acquisition and licensing transaction well through the development and introduction of our product into new market we face numerous risk to our business there is no guarantee that our effort and strategy to expand sale in emerging market will succeed emerging market country may be especially vulnerable to period of global political legal regulatory and financial instability including sovereign debt issue and or the imposition of international sanction in response to certain state action we expand internationally we are subject to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate relative to the dollar while we have program in place that is designed to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation through foreign currency hedging arrangement our hedging effort do not completely offset the effect of these fluctuation on our revenue and earnings we may also be required to increase our reliance on third party agent and unfamiliar operation and arrangement previously utilized by company that we partner with or acquire in emerging market see we must conduct clinical trial in human before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidate or existing product for new indication our international operation and business may also be subject to le protective intellectual property or other applicable law diverse data privacy and protection requirement changing tax law and tariff far reaching anti bribery and anti corruption law and regulation and or an evolving legal and regulatory environment these legal and operational challenge along with governmental control the challenge of attracting and retaining qualified personnel and obtaining and or maintaining necessary regulatory or pricing approval of our product may result in material adverse impact on our international product sale business and result of operation our business may be affected by litigation and government investigation we and certain of our subsidiary are involved in legal proceeding see part iv note contingency and commitment to the consolidated financial statement civil and criminal litigation is inherently unpredictable and the outcome can result in costly verdict fine and penalty exclusion from the federal healthcare program and or injunctive relief that affect how we operate our business defense of litigation claim can be expensive time consuming and distracting and it is possible that we could incur judgment or enter into settlement of claim for monetary damage or change the way we operate our business which could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation in addition product liability is major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical product we may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trial and for product that we sell after regulatory approval product liability claim regardless of their merit could be costly and divert management attention and adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our product we and certain of our subsidiary have previously been named defendant in product liability action for certain of our product we are also involved in government investigation that arise in the ordinary course of our business in recent year there ha been trend of increasing government investigation and litigation against company operating in our industry both in the united state and around the world our business activity outside of the united state are subject to the fcpa and similar anti bribery or anti corruption law regulation or rule of other country in which we operate including the uk bribery act we announced on december we finalized settlement agreement with the government and various other party to settle certain allegation regarding our sale and marketing practice in connection with that settlement we are now operating under corporate integrity agreement cia with the oig of the department of health and human service that requires to maintain our corporate compliance program and to undertake set of defined corporate integrity obligation until december the cia also provides for an independent third party review organization to ass and report on our compliance program while we expect to fully comply with all of our obligation under the cia the failure to do so could result in substantial penalty and our being excluded from government healthcare program we may also be subject to action by governmental entity including those not participating in the settlement and may in the future become subject to claim by other party in each case with respect to the alleged conduct which is the subject of the settlement we may see new governmental investigation or action against citing novel theory of recovery any of these result could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation we are increasingly dependent on information technology system infrastructure and data security we are increasingly dependent upon information technology system infrastructure and data security the multitude and complexity of our computer system and the potential value of our data make them inherently vulnerable to service interruption or destruction malicious intrusion and random attack likewise data privacy or security breach by employee or others may pose risk that sensitive data including intellectual property trade secret or personal information belonging to the company it patient customer or other business partner may be exposed to unauthorized person or to the public global biotechnology company our system are subject to frequent cyber attack these attack are growing in their frequency sophistication and intensity and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect they are often carried out by motivated well resourced skilled and persistent actor including nation state organized crime group and hacktivists cyber attack could include the deployment of harmful malware and key logger denial of service attack malicious website the use of social engineering and other mean to affect the confidentiality integrity and availability of our information technology system infrastructure and data our key business partner face similar risk and any security breach of their system could adversely affect our security posture although in the past we have experienced cyber attack and intrusion into our computer system we do not believe that such attack have had material adverse effect on our operation while we continue to invest heavily in the protection of our critical or sensitive data and information technology there can be no assurance that our effort will prevent or detect service interruption or breach in our

global economic condition may negatively affect and may magnify certain risk that affect our business our operation and performance have been and may continue to be affected by global economic condition financial pressure may cause government or other third party payer to more aggressively seek cost containment measure see our sale depend on coverage and reimbursement from third party payer and pricing and reimbursement pressure may affect our profitability result of global economic condition some third party payer may delay or be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligation job loss or other economic hardship may also affect patient ability to afford health care result of increased co pay or deductible obligation greater cost sensitivity to existing co pay or deductible obligation lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reason we believe such condition have led and could continue to lead to reduced demand for our product which could have material adverse effect on our product sale business and result of operation economic condition may also adversely affect the ability of our distributor customer and supplier to obtain the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw material and to perform their obligation under agreement with which could disrupt our operation although we monitor our distributor customer and supplier financial condition and their liquidity to mitigate our business risk some of our distributor customer and supplier may become insolvent which could have material adverse effect on our product sale business and result of operation we maintain significant portfolio of investment disclosed cash equivalent and marketable security on our consolidated balance sheet the value of our investment may be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuation downgrade in credit rating illiquidity in the capital market and other factor that may result in other than temporary decline in the value of our investment any of those event could cause to record impairment charge with respect to our investment portfolio or to realize loss on the sale of investment our stock price is volatile our stock price like that of our peer in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry is volatile our revenue and operating result may fluctuate from period to period for number of reason event such delay in product development or even

healthcare provider are dependent in part on the economic stability and creditworthiness of their applicable country historically some payment from number of european government healthcare provider have extended beyond the contractual term of sale and regional economic uncertainty continues in particular credit and economic condition in southern europe particularly in spain italy greece and portugal continue to adversely impact the timing of collection of our trade receivables in this region of december and account receivable in these four country totaled million and million respectively of these receivables million and million were past due of december and respectively although economic condition in this region may continue to affect the average length of time it take to collect payment to date we have not incurred any significant loss related to these receivables and the timing of payment in these country ha not had is it currently expected to have material adverse impact on our overall operating cash flow however if government funding for healthcare were to become unavailable in these country or if significant adverse adjustment to past payment practice were to occur we might not be able to collect the entire balance of these receivables we will continue working closely with these customer monitoring the economic situation and taking appropriate action necessary cash equivalent and marketable securitiesof our cash cash equivalent and marketable security totaling approximately billion of december approximately billion wa generated from operation in foreign tax

contract that resulted in the receipt of million in cash offset by the timing of payment to vendor and cash received from customer cash provided by operating activity increased during due primarily to higher revenue higher operating income including the impact of the expiration of the enbrel co promotion term on october and improvement in working capital investingcapital expenditure which were

statement for further discussion off balance sheet arrangementswe do not have any off balance sheet arrangement that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated result of operation obligationscontractual obligation represent future cash commitment and liability under agreement with third party and exclude contingent liability for which we can not reasonably predict future payment additionally the expected timing of payment of the obligation presented below is estimated based on current information timing of payment and actual amount paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of good or service or change to agreed upon term or amount for some obligation the following table represents our contractual obligation aggregated by type in million payment due by period of december year year year yearscontractual obligationstotal and and and beyondlong term debt obligation lease obligation total contractual obligation long term debt obligation include future interest payment which are included in our financing arrangement at the fixed contractual coupon rate to achieve desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt we enter into interest rate swap contract that effectively convert fixed rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuance to floating libor based coupon over the life of the respective note we used an interest rate forward curve at december in computing net amount to be paid or received under our interest rate swap contract which resulted in an aggregate net decrease in future interest payment of million see part iv note financing arrangement to the consolidated financial statement for further discussion of our interest swap contract long term debt obligation include future interest payment under our term loan at libor based variable rate of interest we used an interest rate forward curve at december in computing interest payment on this debt obligation see part iv note financing arrangement to the consolidated financial statement for further discussion of this debt obligation long term debt obligation include contractual interest payment and principal repayment of our foreign denominated debt obligation in order to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our pound sterling and euro denominated long term debt we entered into cross currency swap contract that effectively convert interest payment and principal repayment on this debt from euro pound sterling to dollar for purpose of this table we used the contracted exchange rate in the cross currency swap contract to compute the net amount of future interest payment and principal repayment on this debt see part iv note derivative instrument to the consolidated financial statement for further discussion of our cross currency swap contract interest payment and the repayment of principal on our euro note were translated into dollar at the foreign currency exchange rate in effect at december see part iv note financing arrangement to the consolidated financial statement for further discussion of our long term debt obligation purchase obligation relate primarily to commitment including those related to clinical trial for new and existing product ii capital expenditure and iii open purchase order for the acquisition of good and service in the ordinary course of business our obligation to pay certain of these amount may be reduced based on certain future event liability for utbs net of foreign tax credit and federal tax benefit of state tax and related accrued interest and penalty totaling approximately billion at december are not included in the table above because due to their nature there is high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflow and other event that extinguish these liability in addition to amount in the table above we are contractually obligated to pay additional amount which in the aggregate are significant upon the achievement of various development regulatory and commercial milestone for agreement we have entered into with third party including contingent consideration incurred in the acquisition of dezima pharma dezima and biovex these payment are contingent upon the occurrence of various future event substantially all of which have high degree of uncertainty of occurring these contingent payment have not been included in the table above and except with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet of december the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreement we have entered into with third party is approximately billion including billion of contingent consideration payment in connection with the acquisition of dezima and biovex see part iv note fair value measurement to the consolidated financial statement of critical accounting policiesthe preparation of our consolidated financial statement in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect the amount reported in the financial statement and the note to the financial statement some of those judgment can be subjective and complex and therefore actual result could differ materially from those estimate under different assumption or condition product sale and sale deductionsrevenues from sale of our product are recognized when the product are shipped and title and risk of loss have passed product sale are recorded net of accrual for estimated rebate wholesaler chargebacks cash discount and other deduction collectively sale deduction and return which are established at the time of sale we analyze the adequacy of our accrual for sale deduction quarterly amount accrued for sale deduction are adjusted when trend or significant event indicate that adjustment is appropriate accrual are also adjusted to reflect actual result amount recorded in accrued liability in the consolidated balance sheet for sale deduction were follows in million rebate chargebacks other deduction totalbalance of january charged against product balance of december charged against product balance of december charged against product balance of december the year ended december and total sale deduction were and of gross product sale respectively included in the amount are immaterial adjustment related to prior year sale due to change in estimate such amount represent le than of the aggregate sale deduction charged against product sale in each of the three year ended december in the united state we utilize wholesaler the principal mean of distributing our product to healthcare provider such physician or their clinic dialysis center hospital and pharmacy product we sell in europe are distributed principally to hospital and or wholesaler depending on the distribution practice in each country where the product is sold we monitor the inventory level of our product at our wholesaler by using data from our wholesaler and other third party and we believe wholesaler inventory have been maintained at appropriate level generally two to three week given end user demand accordingly historical fluctuation in wholesaler inventory level have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sale deduction and return accrual for sale deduction are based primarily on estimate of the amount earned or to be claimed on the related sale these estimate take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirement specific known market event and trend internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying pattern sale deduction are substantially product specific and therefore for any given year can be impacted by the mix of product sold rebate include primarily amount paid to payer and provider in the united state including those paid to state medicaid program and are based on contractual arrangement or statutory requirement which vary by product by payer and by individual payer plan we sell product we estimate the amount of rebate we will pay based on the product sold contractual term estimated patient population historical experience and wholesaler inventory level and accrue these rebate in the period the related sale is recorded we then adjust the rebate accrual more information becomes available and to reflect actual claim experience estimating such rebate is complicated in part because of the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability we believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebate is reasonable and appropriate given current fact and circumstance but actual result may differ for example we had managed medicaid rebate adjustment of million in change in annual estimate related to prior annual period were le than of the estimated rebate amount charged against product sale for the year ended december and and le than for the year ended december including the aforementioned adjustment change in our rebate estimate attributable to rebate recognized in would had an impact of approximately million or approximately of our product sale and corresponding impact on our financial condition and liquidity wholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreement to sell product to healthcare provider in the united state at fixed price that are lower than the price we charge wholesaler when healthcare provider purchase our product through wholesaler at these reduced price wholesaler charge for the difference between their purchase price and the contractual price between amgen and the healthcare provider the provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sale by our wholesaler customer to healthcare provider accrual for wholesaler chargebacks are le difficult to estimate than rebate and closely approximate actual result since chargeback amount are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare provider and we generally settle the liability for these deduction within few week product returnsreturns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sale on production lot basis historical rate of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected change in the marketplace specific to each product when appropriate in each of the past three year sale return provision have amounted to le than of gross product sale change in estimate for prior year sale return provision have historically been insignificant income taxesthe company provides for income tax based on pretax income and applicable tax rate available in the various jurisdiction in which it operates we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merit of the position the tax benefit recognized in the financial statement on particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized the amount of utbs is adjusted appropriate for change in fact and circumstance such significant amendment to existing tax law new regulation or interpretation by the taxing authority new information obtained during tax examination or resolution of an examination we believe our estimate for uncertain tax position are appropriate and sufficient for any assessment that may result from examination of our tax return we recognize both accrued interest and penalty where appropriate related to utbs in income tax expense certain item are included in the company tax return at different time than they are reflected in the financial statement and cause temporary difference between the tax base of asset and liability and their reported amount such temporary difference create deferred tax asset and liability deferred tax asset are generally item that can be used tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future year but for which the company ha already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statement the company establishes valuation allowance against it deferred tax asset when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit deferred tax liability are either tax expense recognized in the financial statement for which payment ha been deferred ii expense for which the company ha already taken deduction on the tax return but ha not yet recognized the expense in the financial statement or iii liability for the difference between the book basis and tax basis of the intangible asset acquired in many business combination future expense associated with these asset most often will not be tax deductible the company is vertically integrated enterprise with operation in the united state and various foreign jurisdiction the company is subject to income tax in the foreign jurisdiction where it conduct activity based on the tax law and principle of such jurisdiction and the function risk and activity performed therein the company pretax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign source based on the operation performed in each location and the tax law and principle of the respective taxing jurisdiction for example the company conduct significant operation outside the united state in puerto rico pertaining to manufacturing distribution and other related function to meet it worldwide product demand income from the company operation in puerto rico is subject to tax incentive grant that expires in our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no income tax or foreign withholding tax have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the united state substantially all of this benefit is attributable to the company foreign income associated with the company operation conducted in puerto rico if future event including material change in cash working capital and long term investment requirement necessitate that certain asset associated with these earnings be repatriated to the united state under current tax law an additional tax provision and related liability would be required at the applicable income tax rate which could have material adverse effect on both our future effective tax rate and our financial result operation are subject to the tax law regulation and administrative practice of the united state state jurisdiction and other country in which we do business significant change in these rule could have material adverse effect on the company result of operation see part item risk factor the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liability could affect our profitability contingenciesin the ordinary course of business we are involved in various legal proceeding and other matter such intellectual property dispute contractual dispute governmental investigation and class action suit which are complex in nature and have outcome that are difficult to predict certain of these proceeding are discussed in part iv note contingency and commitment to the consolidated financial statement we record accrual for loss contingency to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that liability ha been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated we consider all relevant factor when making assessment regarding these contingency while it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcome of these item an adverse determination in one or more of these item currently pending could have material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation financial position or cash flow valuation of asset and liability in connection with business combinationswe have acquired and continue to acquire intangible asset in connection with business combination these intangible asset consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic product and ipr product candidate discounted cash flow model are typically used to determine the fair value of these intangible asset for purpose of allocating consideration paid to the net asset acquired in business combination these model require the use of significant estimate and assumption including but not limited to determining the timing and expected cost to complete in process project taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date projecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the fda and other regulatory agency for product candidate estimating the timing of and future net cash flow from product sale resulting from completed product and in process project and developing appropriate discount rate to calculate the present value of the cash flow significant estimate and assumption are also required to determine the acquisition date fair value of any contingent consideration obligation incurred in connection with business combination in addition we must revalue these obligation each subsequent reporting period until the related contingency are resolved and record change in their fair value in earnings the acquisition date fair value of various contingent consideration obligation incurred or assumed in the acquisition of business see part iv note business combination and note fair value measurement to the consolidated financial statement were determined using combination of valuation technique significant estimate and assumption required for these valuation included but were not limited to the probability of achieving regulatory milestone product sale projection under various scenario and discount rate used to calculate the present value of the required payment these estimate and assumption are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligation each reporting period accordingly subsequent change in underlying fact and circumstance could result in change in these estimate and assumption which could have material impact on the estimated future fair value of these obligation we believe the fair value used to record intangible asset acquired and contingent consideration obligation incurred in connection with business combination are based upon reasonable estimate and assumption given the fact and circumstance of the related valuation date impairment of long lived assetswe review the carrying value of our property plant and equipment and our finite lived intangible asset for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if such circumstance exist an estimate of undiscounted future cash flow to be generated by the long lived asset is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists if an asset is determined to be impaired the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset fair value and it carrying value indefinite lived intangible asset composed of ipr project acquired in business combination which have not reached technological feasibility or lack regulatory approval at the time of acquisition are reviewed for impairment annually whenever or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and upon establishment of technological feasibility or regulatory approval we determine impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to it carrying value if the asset carrying value exceeds it fair value an impairment charge is recorded for the difference and it carrying value is reduced accordingly estimating future cash flow of an ipr product candidate for purpose of an impairment analysis requires to make significant estimate and assumption regarding the amount and timing of cost to complete the project and the amount timing and probability of achieving revenue from the completed product similar to how the acquisition date fair value of the project wa determined described above there are often major risk and uncertainty associated with ipr project we are required to obtain regulatory approval in order to be able to market these product such approval require completing clinical trial that demonstrate product candidate is safe and effective consequently the eventual realized value of the acquired ipr project may vary from it estimated fair value at the date of acquisition and ipr impairment charge may occur in future period which could have material adverse effect on our result of operation we believe our estimation of future cash flow used for assessing impairment of long lived asset are based on reasonable assumption given the fact and circumstance of the related date of the assessment item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskwe are exposed to market risk that may result from change in interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and price of equity instrument well change in general economic condition in the country where we conduct business to reduce certain of these risk we enter into various type of foreign currency and interest rate derivative hedging transaction part of our risk management program we do not use derivative for speculative trading purpose in the discussion that follows we have assumed hypothetical change in interest rate of basis point from those at december and we have also assumed hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rate against the dollar based on it position relative to other currency of december and interest rate sensitive financial instrumentsour portfolio of available for sale interest bearing security at december and wa comprised of treasury security and other government related debt security corporate debt security residential mortgage backed and other mortgage and asset backed security money market mutual fund and other short term interest bearing security composed principally of commercial paper the fair value of our investment portfolio of interest bearing security were billion and billion at december and respectively duration is sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of security that will result from basis point change in interest rate applying duration model hypothetical basis point increase in interest rate at december and would have resulted in reduction in the fair value of these security of approximately million and million respectively on these date in addition hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rate at december and would not result in material effect on income or cash flow in the respective ensuing year of december we had outstanding debt with carrying value of billion and fair value of billion of december we had outstanding debt with carrying value of billion and fair value of billion our outstanding debt wa comprised primarily of debt with fixed interest rate the carrying value of variable rate debt wa billion and billion at december and respectively change in interest rate do not affect interest expense or cash flow on fixed rate debt change in interest rate would however affect the fair value of fixed rate debt hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rate relative to interest rate at december and would have resulted in an increase of approximately billion in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on each of these date the analysis for the debt doe not consider the impact that hypothetical change in interest rate would have on the related interest rate swap contract and cross currency swap contract discussed below to achieve desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt we entered into interest rate swap contract during and which qualified and were designated for accounting purpose fair value hedge for certain of our fixed rate debt these derivative contract effectively converted fixed rate interest coupon to floating rate libor based coupon over the life of the respective note interest rate swap contract with an aggregate notional amount of billion were outstanding at december and hypothetical basis point increase in interest rate relative to interest rate at december and would have resulted in reduction in fair value of approximately million and million respectively on our interest rate swap contract on these date and would not result in material effect on the related income or cash flow in the respective ensuing year the analysis for the interest rate swap contract doe not consider the impact that hypothetical change in interest rate would have on the related fair value of debt that these interest rate sensitive instrument were designed to offset of december and we had outstanding cross currency swap contract with aggregate notional amount of billion that hedge certain of our foreign currency denominated debt and related interest payment these contract effectively convert interest payment and principal repayment of this debt to dollar from euro pound sterling and are designated for accounting purpose cash flow hedge hypothetical basis point adverse movement in interest rate relative to interest rate at december and would have resulted in reduction in the fair value of our cross currency swap contract of approximately million and million respectively but would have no material effect on cash flow or income in the respective ensuing year foreign currency sensitive financial instrumentsour international operation are affected by fluctuation in the value of the dollar compared to foreign currency predominantly the euro increase and decrease in our international product sale from movement in foreign currency exchange rate are offset partially by the corresponding increase or decrease in our international operating expense increase and decrease in our foreign currency denominated asset from movement in foreign currency exchange rate are offset partially by the corresponding increase or decrease in our foreign currency denominated liability to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation on our result of operation we enter into foreign currency forward option and cross currency swap contract of december we had outstanding euro and pound sterling denominated debt with carrying value and fair value of billion and billion respectively of december the carrying value and fair value of this debt denominated in foreign currency wa billion and billion respectively hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rate compared with the dollar relative to exchange rate at december would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately million on this date and reduction in income in the ensuing year of approximately million but would have no material effect on the related cash flow in the ensuing year hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rate compared with the dollar relative to exchange rate at december would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately million on this date and reduction in income in the ensuing year of approximately million but would have no material effect on the related cash flow in the ensuing year the analysis for this debt doe not consider the offsetting impact that hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rate would have on the related cross currency swap contract which are in place for the majority of the foreign currency denominated debt with regard to our billion notional amount of cross currency swap contract that are designated cash flow hedge of certain of our debt denominated in euro and pound sterling of december and hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rate compared with the dollar relative to exchange rate on these date would have resulted in reduction in the fair value of these contract of approximately million on each of these date but would have no material effect on the related cash flow in the respective ensuing year the impact on income in the ensuing year from these contract of this hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rate would be fully offset by the corresponding hypothetical change in the carrying amount of the related hedged debt we enter into foreign currency forward and option contract that are designated for accounting purpose cash flow hedge of certain anticipated foreign currency transaction of december we had open foreign currency forward and option contract primarily euro based with notional amount of billion and million respectively of december we had open foreign currency forward and option contract primarily euro based with notional amount of billion and million respectively of december and the fair value of these contract wa approximately million and million respectively with regard to foreign currency forward and option contract that were open at december hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rate compared with the dollar relative to exchange rate at december would have resulted in reduction in fair value of these contract of approximately million on this date and in the ensuing year reduction in income and cash flow of approximately million with regard to contract that were open at december hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rate compared with the dollar relative to exchange rate at december would have resulted in reduction in fair value of these contract of approximately million on this date and in the ensuing year reduction in income and cash flow of approximately million the analysis doe not consider the impact that hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rate would have on anticipated transaction that these foreign currency sensitive instrument were designed to offset of december and we had open foreign currency forward contract with notional amount totaling million and million respectively that hedged fluctuation of certain asset and liability denominated in foreign currency but were not designated hedge for accounting purpose these contract had no material net unrealized gain or loss at december and with regard to these foreign currency forward contract that were open at december and hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rate compared with the dollar relative to exchange rate on these date would not have material effect on the fair value of these contract related income or cash flow in the ensuing year the analysis doe not consider the impact that hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rate would have on asset and liability that these foreign currency sensitive instrument were designed to offset market price sensitive financial instrumentsas of december and we were also exposed to price risk on equity security included in our portfolio of investment which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objective these investment are generally in small capitalization stock in the biotechnology industry sector price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio of december and wa not material counterparty credit risksour financial instrument including derivative are subject to counterparty credit risk which we consider part of the overall fair value measurement our financial risk management policy limit derivative transaction by requiring transaction to be with institution with minimum credit rating of or equivalent by moody or fitch and requires placing exposure limit on the amount with any individual counterparty in addition we have an investment policy that limit investment to certain type of debt and money market instrument issued by institution primarily with investment grade credit rating and place

reflect the company assumption about the input that market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstance the

and significant to the overall fair value measurementthe availability of observable input can vary among the various type of financial asset and liability to the extent that the valuation is based on model or input that are le observable or unobservable in the market the determination of fair value requires more judgment in certain case the input used for measuring fair value may fall into different level of the fair value hierarchy in such case for financial statement disclosure purpose the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorized is
