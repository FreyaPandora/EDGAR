invest significantly greater resource than anticipated in research and development effort without corresponding increase in revenue our operating result could decline in order to remain competitive and meet the demand of the market we serve we expect to devote substantial portion of our resource to research and development our ability to compete will depend on among other factor our ability to continue to keep pace with technological development develop and introduce new product service technology and enhancement on timely basis transition our semiconductor product to increasingly smaller line width geometry obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging material and succeed in significant foreign market such china and india if we are unable to compete in our current or new market demand for our product could decrease which could cause our revenue to decline and our financial result to suffer if and to the extent we offer product in new market we may face competition from existing competitor well from company with which we currently do not compete we expect substantial competition from both intel and amd strategy of selling platform solution including integrating cpu and gpu on the same chip or same package evidenced by intel cpu with integrated graphic and amd apu product amd and intel continue to pursue platform solution and integrated cpu we may not be able to successfully compete and our business could be negatively impacted despite the use of these integrated cpu personal computer or pc builder and consumer have continued to embrace discrete gpus to provide higher performance if integrated cpu offer more compelling value proposition in the future pc builder and consumer may move away from the use of discrete gpus which could adversely affect our business and cause our financial result to decline we are implementing business strategy to license our gpu core and visual computing patent portfolio to device manufacturer although we have engaged in licensing in the past we are engaging broader market with new and existing competitor who may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirement and emerging technology we can not be assured of the extent of the demand for license to our gpu core or other element of our visual computing patent portfolio or that we will be able to compete successfully current or new competitor who may have stronger position in these new market of contentsour business result could be adversely affected if the identification and development of new product is delayed or unsuccessful in order to maintain or improve our financial result we will need to continue to identify and develop new product and enhancement to our existing product in timely and cost effective manner the process of developing new product and service and enhancing existing product and service is highly complex costly and uncertain and any failure by to anticipate customer changing need and emerging technology trend could adversely affect our business we must make multi year investment and commit significant resource before knowing whether our prediction will accurately reflect customer demand for our new product and technology it is possible that our development effort will not be successful and that our new technology will not result in meaningful revenue even if we introduce new and enhanced product to the market we may not be able to achieve consumer and or market acceptance of in timely manner our ability to successfully develop and deliver new product will depend on various factor including our ability to effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunity in new market timely complete and introduce new product and technology transition our semiconductor product to increasingly smaller line width geometry and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging material we occasionally have experienced delay in completing the development and introduction of new product and product enhancement and we could experience delay in the future in addition in the past we have faced challenge in managing product transition from older to newer product resulting in obsolete inventory our failure to successfully develop and introduce new product and technology or identify new us for existing or future product could result in rapidly declining average selling price reduced demand for our product or loss of market share any of which could harm our competitive position and cause our revenue gross margin and overall financial result to suffer if we are unable to achieve consumer and market acceptance and design win for our product and technology our result of operation and competitive position will be harmed the success of our business depends to significant extent on our ability to achieve consumer and market acceptance of our new product and enhancement to our existing product and identify and enter new market such cloud based computing appliance server automotive technology smartphones tablet video game console and other similar consumer electronic device the market for our product and technology are characterized by unpredictable and sometimes rapid shift in the popularity of product often caused by the publication of competitive industry benchmark result change in pricing of dynamic random access memory device and other change in the total system cost of add in board or aibs well by severe price competition and by frequent new technology and product introduction broad consumer and market acceptance is difficult to achieve and such consumer and market acceptance if achieved is difficult to sustain due to intense competition and frequent new technology and product introduction our success in achieving consumer and market acceptance will depend in part on our ability to cultivate new industry relationship and improve the functionality of our product the number of internet connected device increase if we do not successfully achieve or maintain consumer and market acceptance for our product and enhancement or identify and enter new market our ability to compete and maintain or increase revenue will suffer we believe achieving design win which entail our existing and future product chosen for hardware component or subassemblies designed by original equipment manufacturer or oems original design manufacturer or odms and aib and motherboard manufacturer is an integral part of our future success our oem odm and aib and motherboard manufacturer customer typically introduce new system configuration often twice per year typically based on spring and fall design cycle or in connection with trade show accordingly our customer are making their design decision our existing product must have competitive performance level or we must timely introduce new product in order to be included in our customer new system configuration this requires that we anticipate the feature and functionality that customer and consumer will demand incorporate those feature and functionality into product that meet the exacting design requirement of our customer of content price our product competitively and introduce product to the market within our customer limited design cycle if oems odms and aib and motherboard manufacturer do not include our product in their system they will typically not use our product in their system at least the next design configuration our ability to achieve design win also depends in part on our ability to identify and be compliant with evolving industry standard unanticipated change in industry standard could render our product incompatible with product developed by major hardware manufacturer and software developer if our product are not in compliance with prevailing industry standard we may not be designed into our customer product design however to be compliant with change to industry standard we may have to invest significant time and resource to redesign our product which could negatively impact our gross margin or operating result if we are unable to achieve new design win for existing or new customer we may lose market share and our operating result would be negatively impacted we depend on foundry to manufacture our product and these third party may not be able to obtain or successfully implement high quality leading edge process technology or otherwise satisfy our manufacturing requirement which would harm our business we do not manufacture the silicon wafer used for our product and do not own or operate wafer fabrication facility instead we are dependent on industry leading foundry such taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited or tsmc to manufacture our semiconductor wafer using their fabrication equipment and technique substantial portion of our wafer are supplied by tsmc the foundry which have limited capacity also manufacture product for other semiconductor company including some of our competitor because we do not have long term commitment contract with any of these foundry they do not have an obligation to provide with any set pricing or minimum quantity of product at any time except may be provided in specific purchase order most of our product are only manufactured by one foundry at time in time of high demand the foundry could choose to prioritize their capacity for other company reduce or eliminate delivery to or increase the price that they charge if we are unable to meet customer demand due to reduced or eliminated delivery or have to increase the price of our product we could lose sale to customer which would negatively impact our revenue and our reputation furthermore our third party foundry may not be able to develop obtain or successfully implement high quality leading edge process technology including transition to smaller geometry process technology needed to manufacture our product profitably or on timely basis if our third party foundry experience manufacturing inefficiency we may fail to achieve acceptable yield or experience product delivery delay for example due to capacity constraint at tsmc of our nanometer kepler gpus in the first quarter of fiscal year we were unable to fulfill customer demand for our high end desktop gpu product and our sale mix shifted to our mainstream desktop gpu product revenue and gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal year were negatively impacted compared to the prior quarter because the lead time needed to establish strategic relationship with new manufacturing partner and achieve initial production could be over year we do not have readily available alternative source of supply for our product in addition the time and effort to qualify new foundry would result in additional expense and diversion of resource and could result in lost sale any of which would negatively impact our financial result we believe that long term market acceptance for our product will depend on reliable relationship with the third party manufacturer we use to ensure adequate product supply and competitive pricing to respond to customer demand failure to achieve expected manufacturing yield for our product could negatively impact our financial result and damage our reputation manufacturing yield for our product are function of product design which is developed largely by and process technology which typically is proprietary to the manufacturer low yield may result from either product design or process technology failure we do not know yield problem exists until our design is manufactured when yield issue is identified the product is analyzed and tested to determine the cause result yield problem may not be identified until well into the production process resolution of yield problem requires cooperation by and communication and the manufacturer because of our potentially limited access to wafer foundry capacity decrease in manufacturing yield could result in an increase in our cost and force to allocate our available product supply among our customer lower than expected yield could potentially harm customer relationship our reputation and our financial result of contentsa decline in demand in certain end user market could decrease the demand for our product and harm our result of operation our customer base includes company in wide range of end user market but we generate significant amount of revenue from sale to consumer of communication and pc related product within these end user market large portion of our revenue is generated from sale to consumer in the smartphone tablet and pc market including professional workstation decline in one or several of these end user market could harm demand for our product and our result of operation and financial condition these decline could be large and sudden because smartphone tablet and pc manufacturer often build inventory during period of anticipated growth they may be left with excess inventory if growth slows or if they incorrectly forecast product transition in these case these manufacturer may abruptly suspend substantially all purchase of additional inventory from supplier like until their excess inventory ha been absorbed which would have negative impact on our financial result we sell our product to limited number of customer and our business could suffer if we lose any of these customer we receive significant amount of our revenue from limited number of customer revenue from significant customer those representing or more of total revenue wa approximately of our total revenue from two customer in fiscal year and approximately and of our total revenue from one customer in fiscal year and respectively approximately of our account receivable balance wa from one customer of january and approximately of our account receivable balance wa from three customer of january we maintain an allowance for doubtful account for estimated loss resulting from the inability of our customer to make required payment and obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to certain customer in the future we may have to record additional reserve or write offs and or defer revenue on certain sale transaction which could negatively impact our financial result and result of the tightening of the credit market we may not be able to acquire credit insurance on the credit we extend to these customer or in amount that we deem sufficient revenue from our largest customer ha fluctuated significantly from period to period primarily due to the timing and number of design win with each customer well the continued diversification of our customer base we expand into new market and will likely continue to fluctuate dramatically in the future our operating result in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sale to relatively small number of customer well the ability of these customer to sell product that incorporate our product in the future these customer may decide not to purchase our product at all purchase fewer product than they in the past or alter their purchasing pattern in some other way particularly because substantially all of our sale are made on purchase order basis which permit our customer to cancel change or delay product purchase commitment with little or no notice to and without penalty our customer may develop their own solution our customer may purchase product from our competitor or our customer may discontinue sale or lose market share in the market for which they purchase our product the loss of any of our large customer or significant reduction in sale we make to them would likely harm our financial condition and result of operation and any difficulty in collecting account receivable could harm our operating result and financial condition of contentsif we fail to appropriately scale our operation in response to change in demand for our existing product or to the demand for new product requested by our customer our business and profitability could be harmed to achieve our business objective it may be necessary from time to time for to expand or contract our operation in the future we may not be able to scale our workforce and operation in sufficiently timely manner to respond effectively to change in demand for our existing product or to the demand for new product requested by our customer in that event we may be unable to meet competitive challenge or exploit potential market opportunity and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected conversely if we expand our operation and workforce rapidly in anticipation of increased demand for our product and such demand doe not materialize at the pace at which we expected the rate of increase in our cost and operating expense may exceed the rate of increase in our revenue which would adversely affect our result of operation in addition if such demand doe not materialize at the pace which we expect we may be required to scale our business through expense and headcount reduction well facility consolidation or closure that could result in restructuring charge that would materially and adversely affect our result of operation because many of our expense are fixed in the short term or are incurred in advance of anticipated sale we may not be able to decrease our expense in timely manner to offset any decrease in customer demand if customer demand doe not increase anticipated our profitability could be adversely affected due to our higher expense level our past growth ha placed and any future long term growth is expected to continue to place significant strain on our management personnel system and resource to implement our current business and product plan we will need to continue to expand train manage and motivate our workforce all of these endeavor require substantial management effort if we are unable to effectively manage our expanding operation we may be unable to scale our business quickly enough to meet competitive challenge or exploit potential market opportunity or conversely we may scale our business too quickly and the rate of increase in our cost and expense may exceed the rate of increase in our revenue either of which would harm our result of operation our revenue may fluctuate while majority of our operating expense are factor of multi year investment ahead of when revenue is received which make our result difficult to predict and could cause our result to fall short of expectation our operating expense are primarily related to multi year research and development investment ahead of the revenue received from the product which are produced our research and development expense totaled billion billion and billion in fiscal year and respectively any one or more of the risk discussed in this annual report on form or other factor could prevent from achieving our expected future revenue or net income accordingly we believe that period to period comparison of our result of operation should not be relied upon an indication of future performance similarly the result of any quarterly or full fiscal year period are not necessarily indicative of result to be expected for subsequent quarter or full fiscal year result it is possible that in some quarter our operating result could be below the expectation of security analyst or investor which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline we believe that our quarterly and annual result of operation may continue to be affected by variety of factor that could harm our revenue gross profit and result of operation because our gross margin for any period depends on number of factor our failure to forecast change in any of these factor could adversely affect our gross margin we are focused on improving our gross margin our gross margin for any period depends on number of factor including the mix of our product sold average selling price introduction of new product product transition sale discount unexpected pricing action by our competitor of content the cost of product component and the yield of wafer produced by the foundry that manufacture our product if we do not correctly forecast the impact of any of the relevant factor on our business there may not be any action we can take or we may not be able to take any possible action in time to counteract any negative impact on our gross margin in addition if we are unable to meet our gross margin target for any period or the target set by analyst the trading price of our common stock may decline our failure to estimate customer demand properly could adversely affect our financial result we manufacture our product based on forecast of customer demand in order to have shorter shipment lead time and quicker delivery schedule for our customer result we may build inventory for anticipated period of growth which do not occur or may build inventory anticipating demand for product that doe not materialize in forecasting demand we make multiple assumption any of which may prove to be incorrect situation that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include change in business and economic condition including downturn in the semiconductor industry and or overall economy change in consumer confidence caused by change in market condition including change in the credit market expectation for inflation and energy price if there were sudden and significant decrease in demand for our product if there were higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirement if we fail to estimate customer demand properly for our older product our newer product are introduced or if our competition were to take unexpected competitive pricing action any inability to sell product to which we have devoted resource could harm our business in addition cancellation or deferral of customer purchase order could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our gross margin and restrict our ability to fund operation additionally because we often sell substantial portion of our product in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitment in timely manner in response to customer cancellation or deferral we could be subject to excess or obsolete inventory and be required to take corresponding inventory write down and or reduction in average selling price if growth slows or doe not materialize or if we incorrectly forecast product demand which could negatively impact our financial result conversely if we underestimate our customer demand for our product our third party manufacturing partner may not have adequate lead time or capacity to increase production for meaning that we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill our customer order on timely basis even if we are able to increase production level to meet customer demand we may not be able to do in cost effective or timely manner inability to fulfill our customer order on timely basis or at all could damage our customer relationship result in lost revenue cause loss in market share impact our customer relationship or damage our reputation any of which could adversely impact our business of contentswe may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefit of business acquisition or strategic investment and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition target which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new product or sell our product we have acquired and invested in other business that offered product service and technology that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing product and business we may enter into future acquisition of or investment in business in order to complement or expand our current business or enter into new business market negotiation associated with an acquisition or strategic investment could divert management attention and other company resource any of the following risk associated with past or future acquisition or investment could impair our ability to grow our business develop new product or sell our product and ultimately could have negative impact on our growth or our financial result difficulty in combining the technology product operation or workforce of the acquired business with our business difficulty in operating in new or multiple new location disruption of our ongoing business or the ongoing business of the company we invest in or acquire difficulty in realizing the potential financial or strategic benefit of the transaction difficulty in maintaining uniform standard control procedure and policy difficulty integrating the target accounting management information human resource and other administrative system diversion of capital and other resource assumption of liability incurring acquisition related cost or amortization cost for acquired intangible asset that could impact our operating result incurring impairment charge related to goodwill and other purchased intangible asset acquired in connection with acquisition or investment diversion of resource and unanticipated expense resulting from litigation arising from potential or actual business acquisition or investment potential failure of the due diligence process to identify significant issue with product quality architecture and development or legal and financial contingency among other thing difficulty in entering into new market in which we have limited or no experience and where competitor in such market have stronger position potential inability to obtain or obtain in timely manner approval from governmental authority which could delay or prevent such acquisition or investment and impairment of relationship with employee vendor and customer or the loss of any of our key employee vendor or customer or our target key employee vendor or customer result of our acquisition or investment of contentswe may be required to record charge to earnings if our goodwill or amortizable intangible asset become impaired which could negatively impact our operating result under generally accepted accounting principle in the united state or gaap we review our amortizable intangible asset and goodwill for impairment when event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable asset from acquisition may not be recoverable due to factor such decline in stock price and market capitalization reduced estimate of future cash flow and slower growth rate in our industry or in any of our reporting unit estimate of future cash flow are based on an updated long term financial outlook of our operation however actual performance in the near term or long term could be materially different from these forecast which could impact future estimate for example in the most recent impairment test of our tegra processor reporting unit the fair value of the reporting unit only exceeded it carrying value by if the future operating result of the tegra processor reporting unit are significantly lower than our estimate the goodwill assigned to tegra processor could be impaired which would negatively impact our result of operation system security risk data protection breach cyber attack and system integration issue could disrupt our internal operation and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenue increase our expense damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price experienced computer programmer and hacker may be able to penetrate our security control and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third party create system disruption or cause shutdown computer programmer and hacker also may be able to develop and deploy virus worm and other malicious software program that attack our product or otherwise exploit any security vulnerability of our product the cost to to eliminate or alleviate malicious software program and security vulnerability could be significant and our effort to address these problem may not be successful and could result in interruption delay cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customer that may impede our sale manufacturing distribution or other critical function we manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business and third party business breach of our security measure or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about or our partner or customer including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data result of fraud trickery or other form of deception could expose our partner and customer or the individual affected to risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business in addition the cost and operational consequence of implementing further data protection measure could be significant for example in july unauthorized third party gained access to certain user information on our online forum we have strengthened security in an effort to minimize future attack however hacker may continue to target our security control in the future and we can not guarantee that our security measure will be able to prevent future breach of our website and or attack on our product portion of our it infrastructure also may experience interruption of service or produce error in connection with systemic failure system integration or migration work that take place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new system and transitioning data which could cause business disruption and be more expensive time consuming disruptive and resource intensive such disruption could adversely impact our ability to fulfill order and interrupt other process delayed sale lower margin or lost customer resulting from these disruption could adversely affect our financial result stock price and reputation we may not be able to attract and retain qualified employee which could negatively impact our business our future success and ability to compete are substantially dependent on our ability to identify hire train and retain highly qualified key personnel the market for key employee in the technology industry can be competitive none of our key employee is bound by an employment agreement meaning our relationship with all of our key employee are at will the loss of the service of any of our key employee could delay our product development effort harm our ability to sell our product or otherwise negatively impact our business of contentswe are dependent on third party for assembly testing and packaging of our product which reduces our control over our product delivery schedule product quantity or product quality our product are assembled tested and packaged by independent subcontractor such advanced semiconductor engineering inc chippac jsi logistics ltd king yuan electronics co and siliconware precision industry co ltd result we do not directly control our product delivery schedule product quantity or product quality all of these subcontractor assemble test and package product for other company including some of our competitor because we do not have long term agreement with our subcontractor when demand for subcontractor to assemble test or package product is high our subcontractor may decide to prioritize the order of other customer over our order because the time required to qualify different subcontractor to assemble test or package our product can be lengthy if we have to find replacement subcontractor we could experience significant delay in shipment of our product product shortage decrease in the quality of our product or an increase in product cost any product shortage or quality assurance problem could increase the cost of manufacture assembly or testing of our product which could cause our gross margin to decline we rely on third party vendor to supply software development tool to for the development of our new product and we may be unable to obtain the tool necessary to develop or enhance new or existing product we rely on third party software development tool to assist in the design simulation and verification of new product or product enhancement to bring new product or product enhancement to market in timely manner or at all we need software development tool that are sophisticated enough or technologically advanced enough to complete our design simulation and verification in the past we have experienced delay in the introduction of product result of the inability of then available software development tool to fully simulate the complex feature and functionality of our product in the future the design requirement necessary to meet consumer demand for more feature and greater functionality from our product may exceed the capability of available software development tool unavailability of software development tool may result in our missing design cycle or losing design win either of which could result in loss of market share or negatively impact our operating result because of the importance of software development tool to the development and enhancement of our product critical component of our product development effort is our partnership with leader in the computer aided design industry including cadence design system inc and synopsys inc we have invested significant resource to develop relationship with these industry leader and have often assisted them in the development of their new product we believe that forming these relationship and utilizing next generation development tool to design simulate and verify our product will help remain at the forefront of the graphic communication and networking segment and develop product that utilize leading edge technology on rapid basis if these relationship are not successful we may be unable to develop new product or product enhancement in timely manner which could result in loss of market share decrease in revenue or negative impact on our operating result if our product contain significant defect our financial result could be negatively impacted our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market share our product are complex and may contain defect or experience failure due to any number of issue in design fabrication packaging material and or use within system if any of our product or technology contains defect compatibility issue or other error we may have to invest additional research and development effort to find and correct the issue such effort could divert our engineer attention from the development of new product and technology and could increase our operating cost and reduce our gross margin in addition an error or defect in new product or release or related software driver after commencement of commercial shipment could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design win also we may be required to reimburse customer including our customer cost to repair or replace product in the field product recall or significant number of product return could be expensive could damage our reputation could result in the shifting of business to our competitor and could result in litigation against cost associated with correcting defect error bug or other issue could be significant and could materially harm our financial result of contentsour business is cyclical in nature and ha experienced severe downturn that have harmed and may in the future harm our business and financial result our business is directly affected by market condition in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry the semiconductor industry ha been adversely affected by many factor including the global downturn that started in the second half of ongoing effort by our customer to reduce their spending diminished product demand increased inventory level lower average selling price uncertainty regarding long term growth rate and underlying financial health and increased competition these factor could among other thing limit our ability to maintain or increase our sale or recognize revenue and in turn adversely affect our business operating result and financial condition if our action to reduce our operating expense to sufficiently offset these factor when they occur are unsuccessful our operating result will suffer we are subject to risk associated with international operation which may harm our business we conduct our business worldwide and we have office in various country outside of the united state our semiconductor wafer are manufactured assembled tested and packaged by third party located outside of the united state and other america we generated and of our revenue for fiscal year and respectively from sale to customer outside the united state and other america the manufacture assembly test and packaging of our product outside of the united state operation of office outside of the united state and sale to customer internationally subject to number of risk including international economic and political condition such political tension between country in which we do business unexpected change in or imposition of legislative or regulatory requirement complying with variety of foreign law differing legal standard with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practice local business and cultural factor that differ from our normal standard and practice including business practice that we are prohibited from engaging in by the foreign corrupt practice act and other anticorruption law and regulation inadequate local infrastructure that could result in business disruption exporting or importing issue related to export or import restriction tariff quota and other trade barrier and restriction financial risk such longer payment cycle difficulty in collecting account receivable and fluctuation in currency exchange rate imposition of additional tax and penalty increased cost due to imposition of climate change regulation such carbon tax fuel or energy tax and pollution limit and other factor beyond our control such terrorism cyber attack civil unrest war and disease if sale to any of our customer outside of the united state and other america are delayed or cancelled because of any of the factor our revenue may be negatively impacted our international operation are subject to many of the above listed risk difficulty with our international operation including finding appropriate staffing and office space may divert management attention and other resource any of which could negatively impact our operating result of contentslegal and regulatory requirement differ among jurisdiction worldwide violation of these law and regulation could result in fine criminal sanction against our officer or our employee prohibition on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation although we have policy control and procedure designed to ensure compliance with foreign law many of these law and regulation are ambiguous and are often interpreted and enforced in unpredictable way the economic condition in our primary overseas market particularly in asia may negatively impact the demand for our product abroad all of our international sale to date have been denominated in united state dollar accordingly an increase in the value of the united state dollar relative to foreign currency could make our product le competitive in international market or require to assume the risk of denominating certain sale in foreign currency we anticipate that these factor will impact our business to greater degree we further expand our international business activity business disruption could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our cost and expense our worldwide operation could be disrupted by earthquake telecommunication failure power or water shortage tsunami flood hurricane typhoon fire extreme weather condition medical epidemic or pandemic and other natural or man made disaster catastrophic event or climate change the occurrence of any of these business disruption could result in significant loss seriously harm our revenue and financial condition adversely affect our competitive position increase our cost and expense and require substantial expenditure and recovery time in order to fully resume operation our corporate headquarters and portion of our research and development activity are located in california and other critical business operation and some of our supplier are located in asia near major earthquake fault known for seismic activity in addition majority of our principal it data center are located in california making our operation vulnerable to natural disaster or other business disruption occurring in this geographical area the manufacture of product component the final assembly of our product and other critical operation are concentrated in certain geographic location including taiwan china and korea our operation could be adversely affected if manufacturing logistics or other operation in these location are disrupted for any reason including natural disaster high heat event or water shortage information technology system failure military action or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issue the ultimate impact on our significant supplier and our general infrastructure of located near major earthquake fault and being consolidated in certain geographical area is unknown however in the event of major earthquake or other natural disaster or catastrophic event our revenue profitability and financial condition could suffer our investment portfolio may become impaired by deterioration of the capital market our cash equivalent and marketable security portfolio of january consisted of cash and cash equivalent commercial paper mortgage backed security issued by government sponsored enterprise asset backed security money market fund and debt security of corporation municipality and the united state government and it agency we follow an established investment policy and set of guideline designed to preserve principal minimize risk and monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk the policy set forth credit quality standard and limit our exposure to any one issuer well our maximum exposure to various asset class and variety of financial instrument consisting principally of cash and cash equivalent commercial paper mortgage backed security issued by government sponsored enterprise asset backed security money market fund and debt security of corporation municipality and the united state government and it agency should financial market condition worsen in the future investment in some financial instrument may pose risk arising from market liquidity and credit concern in addition any deterioration of the capital market could cause our other income and expense to vary from expectation of january we had no material impairment charge associated with our short term investment portfolio and although we believe our current investment portfolio ha very little risk of material impairment we can not predict future market condition or market liquidity or credit availability and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired risk related to regulatory legal our common stock and other matter our common stock price ha at time experienced substantial price volatility and result investor may suffer loss our stock ha at time experienced substantial price volatility result of variation between our actual and anticipated financial result announcement by and our competitor or uncertainty about current global economic condition the stock market whole also ha experienced extreme price and volume fluctuation that have affected the market price of many technology company in way that may have been unrelated to these company operating performance of contentsin the past security class action litigation ha often been brought against company following period of volatility in the market price of it security due to change in the volatility of our stock price we have been in the past and may be in the future the target of security litigation such lawsuit generally result in the diversion of management time and attention away from business operation which could harm our business in addition the cost of defense and any damage resulting from litigation ruling against or settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial result we are subject to litigation which if determined adversely to could harm our business we are engaged in litigation with party related to our acquisition of in in addition in september october and november several putative security class action lawsuit were filed against for alleged defect in our previous generation mcp and gpu product please refer to note of the note to the consolidated financial statement in part iv item of this annual report on form for further detail on these lawsuit there can be no assurance that any litigation to which we are party will be resolved in our favor any claim that is successfully decided against may cause to pay substantial damage including punitive damage and other related fee or prevent from selling or importing certain of our product regardless of whether lawsuit are resolved in our favor or if we are the plaintiff or the defendant in the litigation any lawsuit to which we are party will likely be expensive and time consuming to defend or resolve such lawsuit could result in the diversion of management time and attention away from business operation which could harm our business such lawsuit could also harm our relationship with existing customer and result in the diversion of management time and attention away from business operation which could harm our business cost of defense and any damage resulting from litigation ruling against or settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial result action to adequately protect our intellectual property right such litigation to defend against alleged infringement of intellectual property right or to enforce our intellectual property right could result in substantial cost to and our ability to compete could be harmed if we fail to take such action or are unsuccessful in so we rely primarily on combination of patent trademark trade secret employee and third party nondisclosure agreement and licensing arrangement to protect our intellectual property in the united state and internationally we have numerous patent issued allowed and pending in the united state and in foreign jurisdiction our patent and pending patent application primarily relate to our product and the technology used in connection with our product we also rely on international treaty organization and foreign law to protect our intellectual property the law of certain foreign country in which our product are or may be manufactured or sold including various country in asia may not protect our product or intellectual property right to the same extent the law of the united state this make the possibility of piracy of our technology and product more likely we continuously ass whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovation and technology based on such factor the commercial significance of our operation and our competitor operation in particular country and region the location in which our product are manufactured our strategic technology or product direction in different country and the degree to which intellectual property law exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdiction our pending patent application and any future application may not be approved in addition any issued patent may not provide with competitive advantage or may be challenged invalidated infringed circumvented or misappropriated by third party we expect that the number of issued hardware and software patent increase and competition intensifies the volume of intellectual property infringement claim and lawsuit may increase we may in the future become involved in lawsuit or other legal proceeding alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property right violation by or party that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claim of infringement third party may also claim that our employee have misappropriated or divulged their former employer trade secret or confidential information an unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damage invalidation of patent or family of patent indemnification of customer payment of lost profit or when it ha been sought injunctive relief of contentsin addition in the future we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceeding in order to assert claim of infringement of our intellectual property enforce our patent protect our trade secret or know how or determine the enforceability scope and validity of the propriety right of others if we have to initiate litigation in order to protect our intellectual property our operating expense may increase which could negatively impact our operating result our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business if infringement claim are made against or our product are found to infringe third party patent or intellectual property we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek license to the third party patent or other intellectual property right however we may not be able to obtain license at all or on term acceptable to particularly from our competitor if we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain license from third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our product we could be subject to substantial liability or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our product we may also have to make royalty or other payment or cross license our technology if these arrangement are not concluded on commercially reasonable term our business could be negatively impacted furthermore the indemnification of customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expense which could negatively impact our operating result change in united state tax legislation regarding our foreign earnings could adversely impact our business currently majority of our revenue is generated from customer located outside the united state and significant portion of our asset including employee are located outside the united state united state income tax and foreign withholding tax have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain non united state subsidiary because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operation of those subsidiary throughout the period of president obama administration the white house ha proposed various international tax measure some of which if enacted into law would substantially reduce our ability to defer united state tax on such indefinitely reinvested non united state earnings eliminate certain tax deduction until foreign earnings are repatriated to the united state and or otherwise cause the total tax cost of multinational corporation to increase if these or similar proposal are constituted into legislation in the current or future year they could have negative impact on our financial position and result of operation our operating result may be adversely affected if we are subject to unexpected tax liability we are subject to taxation by number of taxing authority both in the united state and throughout the world tax rate vary among the jurisdiction in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining our provision for our income tax there are many transaction and calculation where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe our tax estimate are reasonable any of the below could cause our effective tax rate to be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provision and accrual the jurisdiction in which profit are determined to be earned and taxed adjustment to estimated tax upon finalization of various tax return change in available tax credit change in stock based compensation expense change in tax law the interpretation of tax law either in the united state or abroad or the issuance of new interpretative accounting guidance related to transaction and calculation where the tax treatment wa previously uncertain and the resolution of issue arising from tax audit with various tax authority of contentsshould additional tax be assessed result of any of the above our operating result could be adversely affected in addition our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by change in the mix of earnings in country with differing statutory tax rate change in tax law or change in the interpretation of tax law we are subject to the risk of owning real property during fiscal year we purchased real property in santa clara california that includes approximately acre of land and twelve commercial building and eventually expect to break ground on new building for corporate headquarters campus in santa clara we also own real property in india we have limited experience in the ownership and management of real property and are subject to the risk of owning real property including the possibility of environmental contamination and the cost associated with mitigating any environmental problem adverse change in the value of these property due to interest rate change change in the market in which the property is located or other factor the risk of loss if we decide to sell and are not able to recover all capitalized cost increased cash commitment for the planned construction of our santa clara campus the possible need for structural improvement in order to comply with zoning seismic and other legal or regulatory requirement increased operating expense for the building or the property or both possible dispute with third party such neighboring owner or others related to the building or the property or both and the risk of financial loss in excess of amount covered by insurance or uninsured risk such the loss caused by damage to the building result of earthquake flood and or other natural disaster expensing employee equity compensation adversely affect our operating result and could also adversely affect our competitive position since inception we have used equity through our equity incentive plan and our employee stock purchase program fundamental component of our compensation package we believe that these program directly motivate our employee and through the use of vesting encourage our employee to remain with we record compensation expense for stock option restricted stock unit and our employee stock purchase plan using the fair value of those award in accordance with gaap stock based compensation expense wa million million and million for fiscal year and respectively related to on going vesting of equity award which negatively impacted our operating result to the extent that expensing employee equity compensation make it more expensive to grant stock option and restricted stock unit or to continue to have an employee stock purchase program we may decide to incur increased cash compensation cost in addition action that we may take to reduce stock based compensation expense that may be more severe than any action our competitor may implement and may make it difficult to attract retain and motivate employee which could adversely affect our competitive position well our business and operating result of contentswe have substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligation in december we issued billion of convertible senior note due or note our substantial indebtedness may limit our ability to use our cash flow or borrow additional fund for working capital capital expenditure acquisition and general corporate and other purpose make it difficult for to satisfy our financial obligation place at competitive disadvantage compared to our le leveraged competitor and increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry condition the exercise of warrant issued to goldman sachs co or goldman concurrently with our note would and the conversion of our note could dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholder the warrant issued concurrently with our note shall be deemed to be automatically exercised on certain date between march and june unless goldman notifies otherwise any issuance by of additional share to goldman upon exercise of the warrant will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholder moreover the conversion of our note may dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholder and could have dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of the note any sale in the public market by goldman of our common stock upon exercise of the warrant or sale in the public market of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the note could adversely affect prevailing market price of our common stock our failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulation could result in range of consequence including fine suspension of production excess inventory sale limitation and criminal and civil liability we are subject to various state federal and international law and regulation governing the environment including restricting the presence of certain substance in electronic product and making producer of those product financially responsible for the collection treatment recycling and disposal of those product although our management system are designed to maintain compliance we can not assure you that we have been or will be at all time in complete compliance with such law and regulation if we violate or fail to comply with any of them range of consequence could result including fine import export restriction sale limitation criminal and civil liability or other sanction we could also be held liable for any and all consequence arising out of exposure to hazardous material used stored released disposed of by or located at under or emanating from our facility or other environmental or natural resource damage environmental law are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time for example the european union and china are two among growing number of jurisdiction that have enacted in recent year restriction on the use of lead among other chemical in electronic product these regulation affect semiconductor packaging there is risk that the cost quality and manufacturing yield of lead free product may be le favorable compared to lead based product or that the transition to lead free product may produce sudden change in demand which may result in excess inventory of contentsthere is also movement to improve the transparency and accountability concerning the supply of mineral coming from the area of conflict recent legislation includes sec disclosure requirement regarding the use of conflict mineral mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining country for which the first report is due on may for the calendar year the implementation of these requirement could affect the sourcing and availability of mineral used in the manufacture of semiconductor device result there may only be limited pool of supplier who provide conflict free metal and we can not assure you that we will be able to obtain product in sufficient quantity or at competitive price furthermore we may incur additional cost associated with complying with these disclosure requirement including cost related to determining the source of any conflict mineral in our product also because our supply chain is complex we may be unable to sufficiently verify the origin for all metal used in our product resulting in reputational challenge with our customer and stockholder some customer may require that all of our product are certified to be conflict free if we can not satisfy these customer they may choose competitor product although we expect to be able to file the required report on time we are dependent upon the information provided by our many supplier to the extent that the information we receive from our supplier is inaccurate or inadequate or our process in obtaining such information do not fulfill the sec diligence requirement we could also face sec enforcement risk future environmental legal requirement may become more stringent or costly and our compliance cost and potential liability arising from past and future release of or exposure to hazardous substance may harm our business and our reputation while we believe that we have adequate internal control over financial reporting if we or our independent registered public accounting firm determines that we do not our reputation may be adversely affected and our stock price may decline section of the sarbanes oxley act of or section requires our management to report on and our independent registered public accounting firm to audit the effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedure for financial reporting we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirement however the manner in which company and their independent public accounting firm apply these requirement and test company internal control remains subject to some judgment to date we have incurred and we expect to continue to incur increased expense and to devote additional management resource to section compliance despite our effort if we identify material weakness in our internal control there can be no assurance that we will be able to remediate that material weakness in timely manner or that we will be able to maintain all of the control necessary to determine that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in the event that our chief executive

condition and result of operation are based upon our consolidated financial statement which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statement requires to make estimate and judgment that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue cost of revenue expense and related disclosure of contingency on an on going basis we evaluate our estimate including those related to revenue recognition cash equivalent and marketable security account receivable inventory income tax goodwill stock based compensation warranty liability litigation investigation and settlement cost and other contingency we base our estimate on historical experience and on various other assumption that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstance the result of which form the basis for making judgment about the carrying value of asset and liability we believe the following critical accounting policy affect our significant judgment and estimate used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statement our management ha discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policy and estimate with the audit committee of our board of director the audit committee ha reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policy and estimate in this annual report on form of contentsrevenue recognition product revenuewe recognize revenue from product sale when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product ha been delivered the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured for most sale we use binding purchase order and in certain case we use contractual agreement evidence of an arrangement we consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer at the point of sale we ass whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured if we determine that collection of fee is not reasonably assured we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured which is generally upon receipt of payment our policy on sale to certain distributor with right of return is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributor resell the product the level of return can not be reasonably estimated our customer program primarily involve rebate which are designed to serve sale incentive to resellers of our product in various target market we account for rebate reduction of revenue and accrue for of the potential rebate and do not apply breakage factor while we have long history of rebate arrangement with oems we believe we are unable to apply our historical experience to reliably estimate the amount of rebate that will eventually be claimed by individual oems the oems are not our direct customer and the quantity and mix of demand they place on cem odms may shift we introduce new generation and iteration of product and we experience change in new competitor offering in addition we typically find that approximately of the rebate we accrue each year are eventually claimed which is substantially close to and that this percentage varies by program and by customer we recognize liability for these rebate at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate rebate typically expire six month from the date of the original sale unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate unclaimed rebate are reversed to revenue the amount of which typically represents approximately of total revenue our customer program also include marketing development fund or mdfs mdfs represent monies paid to retailer system builder original equipment manufacturer or oems distributor and add in card partner that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partner activity while also promoting nvidia product depending on market condition we may take action to increase amount offered under customer program possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such program are offered we account for mdfs reduction of revenue and apply breakage factor to certain type of mdf program accrual for which we believe we can make reasonable and reliable estimate of the amount that will ultimately be unclaimed mdf amount that have been previously recorded against revenue and subsequently expired unclaimed are reversed to revenue such amount have not been significant we also record reduction to revenue by establishing sale return allowance for estimated product return at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rate however if product return for particular fiscal period exceed historical return rate we may determine that additional sale return allowance are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product return license and development revenue for license arrangement that require significant customization of our intellectual property component we generally recognize the related revenue over the period that service are performed for most license and service arrangement we determine progress to completion based on actual direct labor hour incurred to date percentage of the estimated total direct labor hour required to complete the project we periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimate to complete each contract remain accurate provision for estimated loss on contract is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated cost incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded deferred cost on uncompleted contract if the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized the excess amount is recorded deferred revenue revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of project in progress significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hour any change in or deviation from these estimate could have material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period for license arrangement that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverable over the term of the license agreement we record revenue over the life of the license term with consideration received in advance of the performance period classified deferred revenue of contentsroyalty revenue is recognized related to the distribution or sale of product that use our technology under license agreement with third party we recognize royalty revenue upon receipt of confirmation of earned royalty and when collectability is reasonably assured from the applicable licensee account receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful account receivable for estimated loss resulting from the inability of our customer to make required payment management determines this allowance which consists of an amount identified for specific customer issue well an amount based on overall estimated exposure our account receivable are highly concentrated and make vulnerable to adverse change in our customer business and to downturn in the industry and the worldwide economy our overall estimated exposure excludes significant amount that are covered by credit insurance and letter of credit if the financial condition of our customer the financial institution providing letter of credit or our credit insurance carrier were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment additional allowance may be required that could adversely affect our operating result furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain credit insurance in the future of january our allowance for doubtful account receivable wa million and our gross account receivable balance wa million of the million million wa covered by credit insurance and million wa covered by letter of credit if the financial condition of our customer were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment additional allowance may be required and we may have to record additional reserve or write offs on certain sale transaction in the future factor impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables the financial condition of our customer and the extent to which balance are covered by credit insurance or letter of credit the amount of our cumulative bad debt charge over the last three fiscal year ha not been significant result of our low bad debt experience our allowance for doubtful account receivable ha ranged between and during fiscal year and of january our allowance for doubtful account receivable represented of our gross account receivable balance inventory inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or first in first out basis inventory cost consist primarily of the cost of semiconductor purchased from subcontractor including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging manufacturing support cost including labor and overhead associated with such purchase final test yield fallout and shipping cost well the cost of purchased memory product and other component part we charge cost of sale for inventory provision to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or estimated market value or to completely write obsolete or excess inventory most of our inventory provision relate to the write off of excess quantity of product based on our inventory level and future product purchase commitment compared to assumption about future demand and market condition inventory ha been written off or written down it creates new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written up situation that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include change in business and economic condition change in consumer confidence caused by change in market condition sudden and significant decrease in demand for our product inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirement failure to estimate customer demand properly for older product newer product are introduced or unexpected competitive pricing action by our competition in addition cancellation or deferral of customer purchase order could result in our holding excess inventory also because we often sell substantial portion of our product in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitment in timely manner in response to customer cancellation or deferral charge to cost of sale for inventory provision totaled million million and million unfavorably impacting our gross margin by and in fiscal year and respectively sale of inventory that wa previously written off or written down totaled million million and million favorably impacting our gross margin by and in fiscal year and respectively result the overall net effect on our gross margin from charge to cost of sale for inventory provision and sale of item previously written off or written down wa unfavorable impact in fiscal year unfavorable impact in fiscal year and favorable impact in fiscal year of contentsduring fiscal year and the charge we took to cost of sale for inventory provision were primarily related to the write off of excess quantity of certain older generation of gpu and tegra processor product whose inventory level were higher than our updated forecast of future demand for those product fable semiconductor company we must make commitment to purchase inventory based on forecast of future customer demand in doing so we must account for our third party manufacturer lead time and constraint we also adjust to other market factor such product offering and pricing action by our competitor new product transition and macroeconomic condition all of which may impact demand for our product please refer to the gross profit and gross margin discussion below in this management discussion and analysis for further discussion warranty liabilitiescost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranty that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition under limited circumstance we may offer an extended limited warranty to customer for certain product our product are complex and may contain defect or experience failure due to any number of issue in design fabrication packaging material and or use within system if any of our product or technology contains defect compatibility issue or other error we may have to invest additional research and development effort to find and correct the issue in addition an error or defect in new product or release or related software driver after commencement of commercial shipment could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design win also we may be required to reimburse customer

expected to be realized united state income tax ha not been provided on portion of earnings of our non subsidiary to the extent that such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested our calculation of current and deferred tax asset and liability is based on certain estimate and judgment and involves dealing with uncertainty in the application of complex tax law our estimate of current and deferred tax asset and liability may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome change in accounting standard or tax law in the united state or foreign jurisdiction where we operate or change in other fact or circumstance in addition we recognize liability for potential united state and foreign income tax contingency based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax may be due if we determine that payment of these amount is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is le than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statement accordingly of january we had valuation allowance of million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax asset that management determined are not likely to be realized due in part to projection of future taxable income and potential utilization limitation of tax attribute acquired result of stock ownership change to the extent realization of the deferred tax asset becomes more likely than not we would recognize such deferred tax asset an income tax benefit during the period our deferred tax asset do not include the excess tax benefit related to stock based compensation that are component of our federal and state net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards in the amount of million of january consistent with prior year the excess tax benefit reflected in our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards will be accounted for credit to stockholder equity if and when realized in determining if and when excess tax benefit have been realized we have elected to utilize the with and without approach with respect to such excess tax benefit we have also elected to ignore the indirect tax effect of stock based compensation deduction for financial and accounting reporting purpose and specifically to recognize the full effect of the research tax credit in income from operation we recognize the benefit from tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merit of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalty related to unrecognized tax benefit component of income tax expense please refer to note of the note to the consolidated financial statement in part iv item of this annual report on form for additional information of contentsgoodwillgoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if indicator of potential impairment exist using either qualitative or quantitative assessment our impairment review process compare the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to it carrying value we have identified three reporting unit gpu professional solution and tegra processor for the purpose of completing our goodwill analysis goodwill assigned to these reporting unit of january wa million million and million respectively determining the number of reporting unit and the fair value of reporting unit requires to make judgment and involves the use of significant estimate and assumption we also make judgment and assumption in allocating asset and liability to each of our reporting unit we base our fair value estimate on assumption we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain both qualitative and quantitative approach are applicable accounting standard for the assessment of goodwill impairment with the qualitative approach to testing goodwill for impairment we perform an analysis evaluating factor including but not limited to macro economic condition market and industry condition the competitive environment the operational stability and overall financial performance of the reporting unit including cost factor and actual revenue result for reporting unit in which the qualitative assessment concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than it carrying value no further goodwill impairment testing is required for those reporting unit where significant change or event ha occurred where potential impairment indicator exist or for which we have not performed quantitative assessment recently we utilize two step quantitative assessment to testing goodwill for impairment the first step test for possible impairment by applying fair value based test the second step if necessary measure the amount of such impairment by applying fair value based test to individual asset and liability we estimated the fair value of reporting unit by weighing the result from the income approach and the market approach these valuation approach consider number of factor that include but are not limited to prospective financial information growth rate terminal or residual value discount rate and comparable multiple from publicly traded company in our industry and require to make certain assumption and estimate regarding industry economic factor and the future profitability of our business when performing an income approach valuation we incorporate the use of projected financial information and discount rate that are developed using market participant based assumption to our discounted cash flow model our estimate of discounted cash flow were based upon among other thing certain assumption about our expected future operating performance such revenue growth rate operating margin risk adjusted discount rate and future economic and market condition our estimate may differ from actual cash flow due to among other thing economic condition change to our business model or change in operating performance additionally certain estimate of discounted cash flow involve business with limited financial history and developing revenue model which increase the risk of difference between the projected and actual performance the long term financial forecast that we utilize represent the best estimate that we have at this time and we believe that it underlying assumption are reasonable significant difference between our estimate and actual cash flow could materially affect our future financial result which could impact our future estimate of the fair value of our reporting unit during the fourth quarter of fiscal year we utilized quantitative assessment to test goodwill impairment for all three reporting unit and concluded that there wa no impairment the fair value of our gpu and professional solution reporting unit significantly exceeded their carrying value and the fair value of our tegra processor reporting unit exceeded it carrying value by such even if we applied hypothetical decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit it still would not have resulted in the fair value of our reporting unit being le than their carrying value an overall test of the reasonableness of estimated fair value of reporting unit we reconciled the combined fair value estimate of our reporting unit to our market capitalization of the valuation date of october the reconciliation confirmed that the fair value were relatively representative of the market view when applying reasonable control premium to the market capitalization however any significant reduction in the actual amount of future cash flow realized by our reporting unit reduction in the value of market comparables or reduction in our market capitalization could impact future estimate of the fair value of our reporting unit such event could ultimately result in charge to our earnings in future period due to the potential for write down of the goodwill associated with our reporting unit of contentsin particular the fair value of our tegra reporting unit exceeded it carrying value by approximately the fair value of this reporting unit wa assessed using combination of income and market approach the underlying assumption we used in assessing the fair value of the tegra reporting unit include but are not limited to assumption around future revenue growth rate gross margin operating expense investment level overall market growth rate our market share of the overall market and the appropriate discount rate to apply to future cash flow if the actual future result of the tegra reporting unit do not achieve the level we estimated in assessing it fair value the fair value of the tegra reporting unit could decline future decline in the fair value of the tegra reporting unit could result charge to our earnings result of write down of the value of the goodwill associated with that reporting unit our next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year or earlier if indicator of potential impairment exist such indicator include but are not limited to challenging economic condition such decline in our operating result an unfavorable industry or macroeconomic environment substantial decline in our stock price or any other adverse change in market condition such condition could have the effect of changing one of the critical assumption or estimate we use to calculate the fair value of our reporting unit which could result in decrease in fair value and require to record goodwill impairment charge cash equivalent and marketable security cash equivalent consist of financial instrument which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturity of three month or le at the time of acquisition marketable security consist primarily of highly liquid investment with maturity of greater than three month when purchased we generally classify our marketable security at the date of acquisition available for sale these security are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gain and loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of stockholder equity net of tax any unrealized loss which are considered to be other than temporary impairment are recorded in the other income expense section of our consolidated statement of operation realized gain loss on the sale of marketable security are determined using the specific identification method and recorded in the other income expense section of our consolidated statement of operation please refer to note of the note to the consolidated financial statement in part iv item of this annual report on form we measure our cash equivalent and marketable security at fair value the fair value of our financial asset and liability are determined using quoted market price of identical asset or quoted market price of similar asset from active market our level asset consist of our money market fund we classify security within level asset when the fair value is obtained from real time quote for transaction in active exchange market involving identical asset our available for sale security are classified having level input our level asset are valued utilizing market approach where the market price of similar asset are provided by variety of independent industry standard data provider to our investment custodian most of our cash equivalent and marketable security are valued based on level input we do not have any investment classified level of january all of our available for sale investment are subject to periodic impairment review we record charge to earnings when decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be other than temporary or have other indicator of impairment if the fair value of an available for sale debt instrument is le than it amortized cost basis an other than temporary impairment is triggered in circumstance where we intend to sell the instrument it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of it amortized cost basis or credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument if we intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the available for sale debt instrument before recovery of it amortized cost basis we recognize an other than temporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instrument amortized cost basis and it fair value for available for sale debt instrument that are considered other than temporarily impaired due to the existence of credit loss if we do not intend to sell and it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of it remaining amortized cost basis amortized cost basis le any current period credit loss we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other factor the credit loss component is recognized in earnings stock based compensationwe measure stock based compensation expense based on the estimated fair value of equity award at the grant date and recognize the expense using straight line attribution method over the requisite employee service period we estimate the fair value of employee stock option on the date of grant using binomial model we use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant minus dividend yield discount the fair value of award of restricted stock unit or rsus the fair value of our employee stock purchase plan is calculated using the black scholes model our stock based compensation for employee stock purchase plan is expensed using an accelerated amortization model of contentswe determine the fair value of stock option award on the date of grant using an option pricing model that is affected by our stock price well assumption regarding number of highly complex and subjective variable these variable include but are not limited to weighted average expected term risk free interest rate expected stock price volatility dividend yield actual and projected employee stock option exercise behavior vesting schedule and death and disability probability we also segregate option into group of employee with relatively homogeneous exercise behavior in order to calculate the best estimate of fair value using the binomial valuation model the expected life of employee stock option is derived output of our valuation model and is impacted by the underlying assumption of our company the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rate on treasury bill appropriate for the term of our employee stock option our management ha determined that the use of implied volatility is expected to be more reflective of market condition and therefore can reasonably be expected to be better indicator of our expected volatility than historical volatility dividend yield is based on history and expectation of dividend payouts our rsu award are not eligible for cash dividend prior to vesting therefore the fair value of rsus is discounted by the dividend yield additionally for employee stock option and rsu award we estimate forfeiture annually and revise the estimate of forfeiture in subsequent period if actual forfeiture differ from those estimate forfeiture are estimated based on historical experience if factor change and we employ different assumption in the application of accounting standard in future period the compensation expense that we record under these accounting standard may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period using the binomial model we estimated the fair value of the stock option granted under our stock option plan using the following assumption during fiscal year weighted average expected life in year free interest dividend we used the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of share issued under our espp during fiscal year using the following assumption weighted average expected life in year free interest dividend litigation investigation and settlement cost from time to time we are involved in legal action and or investigation by regulatory body we are aggressively defending our current litigation matter however there are many uncertainty associated with any litigation or investigation and we can not be certain that these action or other third party claim against will be resolved without costly litigation fine and or substantial settlement payment if that occurs our business financial condition and result of operation could be materially and adversely affected if information becomes available that cause to determine that loss in any of our pending litigation investigation or settlement is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such event we will record the loss in accordance with gaap however the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimate which could require to record

temporary these security are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gain and loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of stockholder equity net of tax of january we performed sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investment according to our analysis parallel shift in the yield curve of both plus or minus would result in change in fair value for these investment of approximately million other income and expense could also vary materially from expectation depending on gain or loss realized on the sale or exchange of financial instrument impairment charge related to debt security well equity and other investment interest rate and cash cash equivalent and marketable security balance volatility in the financial market and economic uncertainty increase the risk that the actual amount realized in the future on our financial instrument could differ significantly from the fair value currently assigned to them of january our investment in government agency and government sponsored enterprise represented approximately of our total investment portfolio while the financial sector accounted for approximately of our total investment portfolio substantially all of our investment are with or better rated security if the fair value of our investment in these sector wa to decline by the fair value of these investment would decline by approximately million exchange rate risk we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuation to be minimal gain or loss from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other expense net in our consolidated financial statement and to date have not been significant the impact of foreign currency transaction gain loss included in determining net income for fiscal year and wa million million and million respectively currently sale and arrangement with third party manufacturer provide for pricing and payment in united state dollar and therefore are not subject to exchange rate fluctuation increase in the value of the united state dollar relative to other currency would make our product more expensive which could negatively impact our ability to compete conversely decrease in the value of the united state dollar relative to other currency could result in our supplier raising their price in order to continue doing business with fluctuation in currency

preparation of financial statement in conformity with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state or gaap requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset and liability and disclosure of contingent asset and liability at the date of the financial statement and the reported amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period actual result could differ from those estimate on an on going basis we evaluate our estimate including those related to revenue recognition cash equivalent and marketable security account receivable inventory income tax goodwill stock based compensation warranty liability litigation investigation and settlement cost and other contingency these estimate are based on historical fact and various other assumption that we believe are reasonable of contentsnvidia corporation and subsidiariesnotes to the consolidated financial statement continued revenue recognition product revenuewe recognize revenue from product sale when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product ha been delivered the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured for most sale we use binding purchase order and in certain case we use contractual agreement evidence of an arrangement we consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer at the point of sale we ass whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured if we determine that collection of fee is not reasonably assured we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured which is generally upon receipt of payment our policy on sale to certain distributor with right of return is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributor resell the product the level of return can not be reasonably estimated our customer program primarily involve rebate which are designed to serve sale incentive to resellers of our product in various target market we account for rebate reduction of revenue and accrue for of the potential rebate and do not apply breakage factor while we have long history of rebate arrangement with oems we believe we are unable to apply our historical experience to reliably estimate the amount of rebate that will eventually be claimed by individual oems the oems are not our direct customer and the quantity and mix of demand they place on cem odms may shift we introduce new generation and iteration of product and we experience change in new competitor offering in addition we typically find that approximately of the rebate we accrue each year are eventually claimed which is substantially close to and that this percentage varies by program and by customer we recognize liability for these rebate at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate rebate typically expire six month from the date of the original sale unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate unclaimed rebate are reversed to revenue the amount of which typically represents approximately of total revenue our customer program also include marketing development fund or mdfs mdfs represent monies paid to retailer system builder original equipment manufacturer or oems distributor and add in card partner that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partner activity while also promoting nvidia product depending on market condition we may take action to increase amount offered under customer program possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such program are offered we account for mdfs reduction of revenue and apply breakage factor to certain type of mdf program accrual for which we believe we can make reasonable and reliable estimate of the amount that will ultimately be unclaimed mdf amount that have been previously recorded against revenue and subsequently expired unclaimed are reversed to revenue such amount have not been significant we also record reduction to revenue by establishing sale return allowance for estimated product return at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rate however if product return for particular fiscal period exceed historical return rate we may determine that additional sale return allowance are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product return license and development revenuefor license arrangement that require significant customization of our intellectual property component we generally recognize the related revenue over the period that service are performed for most license and service arrangement we determine progress to completion based on actual direct labor hour incurred to date percentage of the estimated total direct labor hour required to complete the project we periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimate to complete each contract remain accurate provision for estimated loss on contract is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated cost incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded deferred cost on uncompleted contract if the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized the excess amount is recorded deferred revenue revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of project in progress significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hour any change in or deviation from these estimate could have material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period for license arrangement that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverable over the term of the license agreement we record revenue over the life of the license term with consideration received in advance of the performance period classified deferred revenue of contentsnvidia corporation and subsidiariesnotes to the consolidated financial statement continued royalty revenue is recognized related to the distribution or sale of product that use our technology under license agreement with third party we recognize royalty revenue upon receipt of confirmation of earned royalty and when collectability is reasonably assured from the applicable licensee advertising expenseswe expense advertising cost in the period in which they are incurred advertising expense for fiscal year and were million million and million respectively rent expense we recognize rent expense on straight line basis over the lease period and accrue for rent expense incurred but not paid product warranty we generally offer limited warranty to end user that range from one to three year for product in order to repair or replace product for any manufacturing defect or hardware component failure cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranty that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition under limited circumstance we may offer an extended limited warranty to customer for certain product we also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issue if loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated stock based compensation we measure stock based compensation expense based on the estimated fair value of equity award at the grant date and recognize the expense using straight line attribution method over the requisite employee service period we estimate the fair value of employee stock option on the date of grant using binomial model we use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant minus dividend yield discount the fair value of award of restricted stock unit the fair value of our employee stock purchase plan is calculated using the black scholes model our stock based compensation for employee stock purchase plan is expensed using an accelerated amortization model litigation investigation and settlement cost from time to time we are involved in legal action and or investigation by regulatory body we are aggressively defending our current litigation matter however there are many uncertainty associated with any litigation or investigation and we can not be certain that these action or other third party claim against will be resolved without litigation fine and or substantial settlement payment if that occurs our business financial condition and result of operation could be materially and adversely affected if information becomes available that cause to determine that loss in any of our pending litigation investigation or settlement is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such event we will record the loss in accordance with gaap however the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimate which could require to record additional cost foreign currency remeasurement we use the united state dollar our functional currency for all of our subsidiary foreign currency monetary asset and liability are remeasured into united state dollar at end of period exchange rate non monetary asset and liability such property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rate revenue and expense are remeasured at average exchange rate in effect during each period except for those expense related to the previously noted balance sheet

judgment are not expected to be realized united state income tax ha not been provided on portion of earnings of our non subsidiary to the extent that such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested our calculation of current and deferred tax asset and liability is based on certain estimate and judgment and involves dealing with uncertainty in the application of complex tax law our estimate of current and deferred tax asset and liability may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome change in accounting standard or tax law in the united state or foreign jurisdiction where we operate or change in other fact or circumstance in addition we recognize liability for potential united state and foreign income tax contingency based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax may be due if we determine that payment of these amount is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is le than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statement accordingly of january we had valuation allowance of million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax asset that management determined are not likely to be realized due in part to projection of future taxable income and potential utilization limitation of tax attribute acquired result of stock ownership change to the extent realization of the deferred tax asset becomes more likely than not we would recognize such deferred tax asset an income tax benefit during the period our deferred tax asset do not include the excess tax benefit related to stock based compensation that are component of our federal and state net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards in the amount of million of january consistent with prior year the excess tax benefit reflected in our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards will be accounted for credit to stockholder equity if and when realized in determining if and when excess tax benefit have been realized we have elected to utilize the with and without approach with respect to such excess tax benefit we have also elected to ignore the indirect tax effect of stock based compensation deduction for financial and accounting reporting purpose and specifically to recognize the full effect of the research tax credit in income from operation we recognize the benefit from tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merit of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalty related to unrecognized tax benefit component of income tax expense please refer to note of these note to the consolidated financial

on treasury bill appropriate for the term of our employee stock option our management ha determined that the use of implied volatility is expected to be more reflective of market condition and therefore can reasonably be expected to be better indicator of our expected volatility than historical volatility dividend yield is based on history and expectation of dividend payouts our rsu award are not eligible for cash dividend prior to vesting therefore the fair value of rsus is discounted by the dividend yield for award granted on or subsequent to november we use dividend yield at grant
