in the united state with store in state and the district of columbia of august the merger agreement wa approved by rite aid stockholder in february the transaction is expected to close in early calendar subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing condition industry overview the retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industry across the globe are highly competitive and have been experiencing consolidation in recent year prescription drug play significant role in healthcare and constitute first line of treatment for many medical condition we believe the long term outlook for prescription drug utilization is strong due in part to aging population increase in life expectancy increase in the availability and utilization of generic drug the continued development of innovative drug that improve quality of life and control healthcare cost and increase in the number of person with insurance coverage for prescription drug including in the united state the expansion of healthcare insurance coverage under the patient protection and affordable care act the aca and baby boomer increasingly becoming eligible for the federally funded medicare part prescription program pharmaceutical wholesaler act vital link between drug manufacturer and pharmacy and healthcare provider in supplying pharmaceutical to patient table of content the retail pharmacy industry across the globe relies significantly on private and governmental third party payer many private organization throughout the healthcare industry including pharmacy benefit management pbm company and health insurance company have consolidated in recent year to create larger healthcare enterprise with greater bargaining power third party payer including the medicare part plan and the state sponsored medicaid and related managed care medicaid agency in the united state can change eligibility requirement or reduce certain reimbursement rate in addition in many european country the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumer and regulates pharmaceutical price patient eligibility and reimbursement level to control cost for the government sponsored healthcare system change in law or regulation also can impact reimbursement rate and term for example the aca seek to reduce federal spending by altering the medicaid reimbursement formula amp for multi source drug in the united state and the uk department of health plan to implement funding cut to reduce cost within the national health service by reducing drug reimbursement rate these change generally are expected to reduce medicaid reimbursement in the united state and pharmacy reimbursement in the uk state medicaid program are also expected to continue to seek reduction in reimbursement independent of amp third party payer or governmental authority take action that restrict eligibility or reduce price or reimbursement rate sale and margin in the retail pharmacy industry could be reduced which would adversely affect industry profitability in case these possible adverse effect may be partially or entirely offset by controlling inventory cost and other expense dispensing more higher margin generic finding new revenue stream through pharmacy service or other offering and or dispensing greater volume of prescription generic prescription drug have continued to help lower overall cost for customer and third party payer we expect the utilization of generic pharmaceutical to continue to increase in general in the united state generic version of drug generate lower sale dollar per prescription but higher gross profit dollar compared with patent protected brand name drug the positive impact on retail pharmacy gross profit dollar can be significant in the first several month after generic version of drug is first allowed to compete with the branded version which is generally referred to generic conversion in any given year the number of major brand name drug that undergo conversion from branded to generic status can vary and the timing of generic conversion can be difficult to predict which can have significant impact on retail pharmacy sale and gross profit dollar we expect that market demand government regulation third party reimbursement policy government contracting requirement and other pressure will continue to cause the industry in which we compete to evolve pharmacist are on the frontlines of the healthcare delivery system and we believe rising healthcare cost and the limited supply of primary care physician present new opportunity for pharmacist and retail pharmacy to play an even greater role in driving positive outcome for patient and payer through expanded service offering such immunization and other preventive care healthcare clinic pharmacist led

pharmacy we purchase our non pharmaceutical merchandise from numerous manufacturer and wholesaler our sale and gross profit are impacted by among other thing the percentage of prescription that we fill that are generic and the rate at which new generic drug are introduced to the market any number of factor outside of our control can affect timing for generic conversion we face substantial uncertainty in predicting when such conversion will occur and effect will have on particular future period the current environment of our pharmacy business also includes ongoing reimbursement pressure and shift in pharmacy mix towards day at retail one prescription that is the equivalent of three day prescription and medicare part prescription further consolidation among generic manufacturer coupled with change in the number of major brand name drug anticipated to undergo conversion from branded to generic status may also result in gross margin pressure within the industry we continuously face reimbursement pressure from pbm company health maintenance organization managed care organization and other commercial third party payer our agreement with these payer are regularly subject to

operation these risk are not the only risk that we face our business operation could also be affected by additional factor that are not presently known to or that we currently consider to be immaterial reduction in third party reimbursement level from private or governmental agency plan and potential change in industry pricing benchmark for prescription drug could materially and adversely affect our result of operation the substantial majority of the prescription we fill are reimbursed by third party payer including private and governmental agency payer the continued effort of health maintenance organization managed care organization pharmacy benefit management company governmental agency and other third party payer to reduce prescription drug cost and pharmacy reimbursement rate well litigation and other legal proceeding relating to drug are priced may adversely impact our result of operation change in political economic and regulatory influence also may significantly affect healthcare financing and prescription drug reimbursement practice in the united state plan change with rate adjustment often occur in january and our reimbursement arrangement may provide for rate adjustment at prescribed interval during their term in addition some of these entity may offer pricing term that we may not be willing to accept or otherwise restrict our participation in their network of pharmacy provider table of content in the united state for example certain provision of the aca which wa signed into law on march enacted subject to rulemaking modified average manufacturer price used in the medicaid rebate and reimbursement formula for multi source drug and in january the center for medicare and medicaid service finalized rule implementing the modified amp well requirement that medicaid reimburse pharmacy at actual acquisition cost rather than estimated acquisition cost these change which state had may to implement generally are expected to reduce medicaid reimbursement and adversely affect our operating result there have also been number of other proposal and enactment by the federal government and various state to reduce medicare part and medicaid reimbursement level in response to budget deficit and we expect additional proposal in the future in addition many payer in the united state are increasingly considering new metric the basis for reimbursement rate such average sale price average manufacturer price and actual acquisition cost it is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulator may evaluate and or develop an alternative pricing reference to replace average wholesale price which is the pricing reference used for many of our contract future change to the pricing benchmark used to establish pharmaceutical pricing including change in the basis for calculating reimbursement by third party payer could adversely affect there can be no assurance that recent or future change in prescription drug reimbursement policy and practice will not materially and adversely affect our result of operation in many country in europe and elsewhere the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumer and regulates pharmaceutical price patient eligibility and reimbursement level to control cost for the government sponsored healthcare system effort to control healthcare cost including prescription drug cost are continuous shift in pharmacy mix toward lower margin plan and program could adversely affect our result of operation shift in the mix of pharmacy prescription volume towards program offering lower reimbursement rate could adversely affect our result of operation our retail pharmacy usa division continued to experience shift in pharmacy mix towards day at retail in fiscal and that trend may continue in fiscal our day at retail offering for patient with chronic prescription need typically is at lower margin than comparable day prescription our retail pharmacy usa division also experienced shift in pharmacy mix towards medicare part prescription in fiscal and we expect that trend to continue in fiscal preferred medicare part network have increased in number in recent year however we do not participate in all such network we have accepted lower reimbursement rate in order to secure preferred relationship with medicare part plan serving senior patient with significant pharmacy need we also have worked to develop and expand our relationship with commercial third party payer to enable new and or improved market access via participation in the pharmacy provider network they offer if we are not able to generate additional prescription volume and other business from patient participating in these program that is sufficient to offset the impact of lower reimbursement or if the degree or term of our participation in such preferred network decline from current level in future year our result of operation could be materially and adversely affected we could be adversely affected by decrease in the introduction of new brand name and generic prescription drug well increase in the cost to procure prescription drug new brand name drug can result in increased drug utilization and associated sale while the introduction of lower priced generic alternative typically result in relatively lower sale but relatively higher gross profit margin accordingly decrease in the number or magnitude of significant new brand name drug or generic successfully introduced or delay in their introduction could materially and adversely affect our result of operation in addition if we experience an increase in the amount we pay to procure pharmaceutical drug including generic drug it could have material adverse effect on our result of operation our gross profit margin would be adversely affected to the extent we are not able to offset such cost increase any failure to fully offset any such increased price and cost or to modify our activity to mitigate the impact could have material adverse effect on our result of operation additionally any future change in drug price could be significantly different than our projection table of content we derive significant portion of our sale in the united state from prescription drug sale reimbursed by pharmacy benefit management company we derive significant portion of our sale in the united state from prescription drug sale reimbursed through prescription drug plan administered by pbm company pbm company typically administer multiple prescription drug plan that expire at various time and provide for varying reimbursement rate and often limit coverage to specific drug product on an approved list known formulary which might not include all of the approved drug for particular indication there can be no assurance that we will continue to participate in any particular pbm company pharmacy provider network in any particular future time period if our participation in the pharmacy provider network for prescription drug plan administered by one or more of the large pbm company is restricted or terminated we expect that our sale would be adversely affected at least in the short term if we are unable to replace any such lost sale either through an increase in other sale or through resumption of participation in those plan our operating result could be materially and adversely affected if we exit pharmacy provider network and later resume participation there can be no assurance that we will achieve any particular level of business on any particular pace or that all client of the pbm company will choose to include in the pharmacy network for their plan initially or at all in addition in such circumstance we may incur increased marketing and other cost in connection with initiative to regain former patient and attract new patient covered by such plan consolidation and strategic alliance in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business operation competitive positioning financial condition and result of operation many organization in the healthcare industry including pbm company and health insurance company have consolidated in recent year to create larger healthcare enterprise with greater bargaining power which ha resulted in greater pricing pressure for example in july optumrx unitedhealth group pharmacy care service business completed it combination with catamaran corporation with the combined business becoming the third largest pbm company in the united state in addition significant business combination within the health insurance industry are currently pending including the transaction contemplated by anthem inc agreement to acquire cigna corporation and aetna inc agreement to acquire humana inc if these pending transaction are completed the resulting enterprise are expected to be two of the three largest health insurer in the united state if this consolidation trend continues it could give the resulting enterprise even greater bargaining power which may lead to further pressure on the price for our product and service if these pressure result in reduction in our price our business would become le profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding reduction in cost new partnership and strategic alliance in the healthcare industry also can alter market dynamic and impact our business and competitive positioning for example following the announcement of our agreement with amerisourcebergen providing for among other thing generic drug purchasing through wbad our global sourcing enterprise some of our retail pharmacy competitor subsequently established relationship with other pharmaceutical drug wholesaler relating to generic drug procurement in addition further consolidation among generic drug

and net asset denominated in currency other than the dollar we present our financial statement in dollar and have significant proportion of net asset and income in non dollar currency primarily british pound sterling and the euro well range of other foreign currency our result of operation and capital ratio can therefore be sensitive to movement in foreign exchange rate due to the constantly changing currency exposure to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rate we can not predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuation upon our future result of operation in addition fluctuation in currency relative to the dollar may make it more difficult to perform period to period comparison of our reported result of operation depreciation of non dollar currency relative to the dollar could have significant adverse impact on our result of operation we may from time to time in some instance enter into foreign currency contract or other derivative instrument intended to hedge portion of our foreign currency fluctuation risk which subject to additional risk such the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligation to that could materially and adversely affect additionally we may and currently do use foreign currency borrowing to hedge some of our foreign currency fluctuation risk the periodic use of such hedging activity may not offset any or more than portion of the adverse financial effect of unfavorable movement in foreign exchange rate over the limited time the hedge are in place we can not assure you that fluctuation in foreign

of faulty assumption underlying expectation process or initiative or the inability to realize and or delay in realizing potential benefit and synergy whether unique corporate culture of separate organization will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner unforeseen expense or delay and competitive factor in the marketplace of august we beneficially owned approximately of the

company may operate in sector that differ from our current operation and have different risk from time to time we make debt or equity investment in other company that we may not control or over which we may not have sole control for example while we have significant equity investment in amerisourcebergen and have designee serving on the board of director of amerisourcebergen of the date of this report we do not and will not have the ability to control day to day operation of that company although the business in which we have made non controlling investment often have significant health and

europe and certain emerging market country in our retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale division an economic slowdown within any such market could adversely affect our business in affected region by reducing the price our customer may be able or willing to pay for our product and service or by reducing the demand for our product and service either of which could result in material adverse impact on our result of operation in recent year in response to the economic environment number of government have announced or implemented austerity measure to reduce healthcare spending for the government sponsored healthcare system and constrain overall government expenditure these measure which include effort aimed at reforming healthcare coverage and reducing healthcare cost continue to exert pressure on the pricing of and reimbursement timeline for pharmaceutical drug country with existing austerity measure may impose additional law regulation or requirement on the healthcare industry in addition government that have not yet imposed austerity measure may impose them in the future any new austerity measure may be similar to or vary in scope and nature from existing austerity measure and could have material adverse effect on our international business operation and result of operation table of content the industry in which we operate are highly competitive and constantly evolving new entrant to the market existing competitor action or other change in market dynamic could adversely impact the level of competition among retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesaler is high change in market dynamic or action of competitor or manufacturer including industry consolidation and the emergence of new competitor and strategic alliance could materially and adversely impact disruptive innovation by existing or new competitor could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require to accurately identify and ass such change and make timely and effective change to our strategy and business model to compete effectively our retail pharmacy business face intense competition from local regional national and global company including other drugstore and pharmacy chain independent drugstore and pharmacy mail order prescription provider and various other retailer such grocery store convenience store mass merchant online and omni channel pharmacy and retailer warehouse club dollar store and other discount merchandiser some of which are aggressively expanding in market we serve business in our pharmaceutical wholesale division face intense competition from direct competitor including national and regional cooperative wholesaler and alternative supply source such importer and manufacturer who supply directly to pharmacy competition may also come from other source in the future competition increase in the market in which we operate significant increase in general pricing pressure could occur which could require to reevaluate our pricing structure to remain competitive for example if we are not able to anticipate and successfully respond to change in market condition in our pharmaceutical wholesale division including change driven by competitor supplier or manufacturer and increased competition from national and regional cooperative wholesaler it could result in loss of customer or renewal of contract or arrangement on le favorable term we also could be adversely affected if we fail to identify or effectively respond to change in market dynamic for example specialty pharmacy represents significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the united state significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacy because our specialty pharmacy business focus on complex and high cost medication that serve relatively limited universe of patient the future growth of this business depends to significant extent upon expanding our ability to access key drug and successfully penetrate key treatment category if we are not able to compete effectively in this evolving market it could have an adverse effect on our business operation financial condition and result of operation if the merchandise and service that we offer fail to meet customer need our sale may be adversely affected we could be adversely affected by change in consumer spending level and shopping habit and preference including attitude towards our retail and product brand the success of our retail pharmacy business depends on our ability to offer superior shopping experience engaging customer service and quality assortment of available merchandise that differentiates from other retailer including enhanced health and beauty product offering we must identify obtain supply of and offer to our customer attractive innovative and high quality merchandise on continuous basis our product and service must satisfy the need and desire of our customer whose preference may change in the future it is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the product and service our customer will demand if we misjudge either the demand for product and service we sell or our customer purchasing habit and taste we may be faced with excess inventory of some product and missed opportunity for product and service we chose not to offer in addition our sale may decline or we may be required to sell the merchandise we have obtained at lower price failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer taste preference and spending pattern and evolving demographic mix in the market we serve could negatively affect our relationship with our customer and the demand for our product and service which could materially and adversely impact our result of operation our private brand offering expose to various additional risk in addition to brand name product we offer our customer private brand product that are not available from other retailer we seek to continue to grow our exclusive private brand offering part of our growth strategy including through the expanded offering of and other brand owned or licensed on an exclusive basis well through selective acquisition maintaining consistent product quality competitive pricing and availability of our private brand offering for our customer well the timely development and introduction of new product is important in differentiating from other retailer and developing and maintaining customer loyalty although we believe that our private brand product offer value to our customer and typically provide with higher gross margin than comparable national brand product we sell the expansion of our private brand offering also subject to additional risk such potential product liability risk and mandatory or voluntary product recall our ability to successfully protect our proprietary right and successfully navigate and avoid claim related to the proprietary right of third party our ability to successfully administer and comply with applicable contractual obligation and regulatory requirement and other risk generally encountered by entity that source sell and market exclusive branded offering for retail an increase in sale of our private brand may also adversely affect sale of our vendor product which in turn could adversely affect our relationship with certain of our vendor any failure to adequately address some or all of these risk could have material adverse effect on our reputation business operation result of operation and financial condition table of content if we do not successfully develop and maintain relevant omni channel experience for our customer our business and result of operation could be adversely impacted our business ha evolved from an in store experience to interaction with customer across numerous channel including in store online mobile and social medium among others omni channel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing customer expectation and new development by our competitor for example in july we announced that we would cease operation at our drugstore com and beauty com property in furtherance of our omni channel strategy and initiative to greater focus on the development of walgreens com in the united state our customer are increasingly using computer tablet mobile phone and other device to comparison shop determine product availability and complete purchase online we must compete by offering consistent and convenient shopping experience for our customer regardless of the ultimate sale channel and by investing in providing and maintaining digital tool for our customer that have the right feature and are reliable and easy to use if we are unable to make improve or develop relevant customer facing technology in timely manner our ability to compete and our result of operation could be materially and adversely affected in addition if our online activity or our other customer facing technology system do not function designed we may experience loss of customer confidence data security breach lost sale or be exposed to fraudulent purchase any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operation reputation and result of operation we may be constrained if we are unable to find suitable new store location at acceptable price or by the term of our current lease our ability to grow our retail pharmacy business may be constrained if suitable new store location can not be identified with lease term or purchase price that are acceptable to we compete with other retailer and business for suitable location for our store local land use and other regulation applicable to the type of store we desire to construct may impact our ability to find suitable location and influence the cost of constructing our store the termination or expiration of lease at existing store location may adversely affect if the renewal term of those lease are unacceptable to and we are forced to close or relocate store further changing local demographic at existing store location may adversely affect revenue and profitability level at those store we may experience significant disruption in our computer system we rely extensively on our computer system to manage our ordering pricing point of sale pharmacy fulfillment inventory replenishment customer loyalty program finance and other process our system are subject to damage or interruption from power outage computer and telecommunication failure computer virus security breach vandalism natural disaster catastrophic event and human error and our disaster recovery planning can not account for all eventuality if any of our system are damaged fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable we may incur substantial cost to repair or replace them and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruption or disruption and delay in our ability to perform critical function which could materially and adversely affect our business and result of operation in addition we are currently making and expect to continue to make substantial investment in our information technology system and infrastructure some of which are significant upgrade involve replacing existing system with successor system making change to existing system or cost effectively acquiring new system with new functionality implementing new system carry significant potential risk including failure to operate designed potential loss or corruption of data or information cost overrun implementation delay disruption of operation and the potential inability to meet business and reporting requirement while we are aware of inherent risk associated with replacing these system and believe we are taking reasonable action to mitigate known risk there can be no assurance that we will not experience significant issue with our existing system prior to implementation that our technology initiative will be successfully deployed planned or that they will be timely implemented without significant disruption to our operation we also could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in the system of third party we interact with including key payer and vendor if we or the business we interact with do not maintain the privacy and security of sensitive customer and business information it could damage our reputation and we could suffer loss of revenue incur substantial additional cost and become subject to litigation and regulatory scrutiny the protection of customer employee and company data is critical to our business cybersecurity and other information technology security risk such significant breach of customer employee or company data could attract substantial amount of medium attention damage our customer relationship and reputation and result in lost sale fine or lawsuit throughout our operation we receive retain and transmit certain personal information that our customer and others provide to purchase product or service fill prescription enroll in promotional program participate in our customer loyalty program register on our website or otherwise communicate and interact with in addition aspect of our operation depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public network although we deploy layered approach to address information security threat and vulnerability designed to protect confidential information against data security breach compromise of our data security system or of those of business with whom we interact which result in confidential information being accessed obtained damaged or used by unauthorized or improper person could harm our reputation and expose to regulatory action and claim from customer financial institution payment card association and other person any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operation financial condition and result of operation in addition security breach could require that we expend substantial additional resource related to the security of information system and disrupt our business table of content the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirement across business we are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data privacy regulation in the united state and in other country in which we operate that regulate the collection use and transfer of personal data including the transfer of personal data between or among country some foreign data privacy regulation are more stringent than those in the united state and continue to change for example in may the general data protection regulation wa formally published in the journal of the european union and come into effect in may complying with these and other changing requirement could cause to incur substantial cost and require to change our business practice in certain jurisdiction any of which could materially adversely affect our business operation and operating result we may also face audit or investigation by one or more domestic or foreign government agency relating to our compliance with these regulation compliance with change in privacy and information security law and standard may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational process if we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these law and regulation or experience data security breach our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to additional litigation and regulatory risk our security measure may be undermined due to the action of outside party employee error malfeasance or otherwise and result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data system and misappropriate business and personal information because the technique used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage system change frequently and may not immediately produce sign of intrusion we may be unable to anticipate these technique or to implement adequate preventative measure any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and potentially have material adverse effect on our business operation financial condition and result of operation we are subject to payment related risk that could increase our operating cost expose to fraud or theft subject to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business operation we accept payment using variety of method including cash check credit and debit card gift card and mobile payment technology such apple pay and we may offer new payment option over time acceptance of these payment option subject to rule regulation contractual obligation and compliance requirement including payment network rule and operating guideline data security standard and certification requirement and rule governing electronic fund transfer these requirement and related interpretation may change over time which could make compliance more difficult or costly for certain payment method including credit and debit card we pay interchange and other fee which could increase over time and raise our operating cost we rely on third party to provide payment processing service including the processing of credit card debit card and other form of electronic payment if these company become unable to provide these service to or if their system are compromised it could disrupt our business the payment method that we offer also subject to potential fraud and theft by person who seek to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weakness that may exist in the payment system if we fail to comply with applicable rule or requirement or if data is compromised due to breach or misuse of data relating to our payment system we may be liable for cost incurred by payment card issuing bank and other third party or subject to fine and higher transaction fee or our ability to accept or facilitate certain type of payment could be impaired in addition our reputation could suffer and our customer could lose confidence in certain payment type which could result in higher cost and or reduced sale and materially and adversely affect our result of operation change in healthcare regulatory environment may adversely affect our business political economic and regulatory influence are subjecting the healthcare industry to significant change that could adversely affect our result of operation in recent year the healthcare industry ha undergone significant change in an effort to reduce cost and government spending these change include an increased reliance on managed care cut in certain medicare and medicaid funding in the united state and the funding of governmental payer in foreign jurisdiction consolidation of competitor supplier and other market participant and the development of large sophisticated purchasing group we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future some of these potential change such reduction in governmental funding for certain healthcare service or adverse change in legislation or regulation governing prescription drug pricing healthcare service or mandated benefit may cause customer to reduce the amount of our product and service they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our product and service we expect continued governmental and private payer pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing change in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing or distribution policy could also significantly reduce our profitability table of content the aca wa enacted in to provide health insurance coverage to million of previously uninsured american through combination of insurance market reform an expansion of medicaid subsidy and health insurance mandate while certain provision of the aca have already taken effect others have delayed effective date or require further rulemaking action or regulatory guidance by governmental agency to implement in addition various market participant continue to react to these regulatory change result there remains uncertainty to the full impact of aca on our business operation future rulemaking or other regulatory action under the aca or otherwise could increase regulation of pharmacy service result in change to pharmacy reimbursement rate and otherwise change the way we do business we can not predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or other regulatory action but any such action could have material adverse impact on our result of operation significant change in or noncompliance with governmental regulation and other legal requirement could have material adverse effect on our reputation and profitability we operate in complex highly regulated environment in the united state and in the other country in which we operate and could be adversely affected by change to existing legal requirement new legal requirement and or any failure to comply with applicable regulation business in our pharmaceutical

be necessary these adjustment would be made in future period some of the more significant estimate include business combination goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment vendor allowance liability for closed location cost of sale and inventory equity method investment pension and postretirement benefit and income tax we use the following method to determine our estimate business combination we account for business combination using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that control is obtained all the asset acquired and liability assumed including amount attributable to noncontrolling interest be recorded at their respective fair value at the date of acquisition the determination of fair value of asset and liability acquired requires estimate and the use of valuation technique when market value is not readily available for intangible asset we generally use the income approach to determine fair value the income approach requires management to make significant estimate and assumption these estimate and assumption primarily include but are not limited to discount rate terminal growth rate royalty rate forecast of revenue operating income depreciation amortization and capital expenditure the discount rate applied to the projection reflect the risk factor associated with those projection table of content although we believe our estimate of fair value are reasonable actual financial result could differ from those estimate due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimate change in assumption concerning future financial result or other underlying assumption could have significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible asset acquired judgment is also required in determining the intangible asset useful life goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more

unit we determine fair value for each reporting unit this determination includes estimating the fair value using both the income and market approach the income approach requires management to estimate number of factor for each reporting unit including projected future operating result economic projection anticipated future cash flow and discount rate the market approach estimate fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within comparable industry grouping the determination of the fair value of the reporting unit and the allocation of that value to individual asset and liability within those reporting unit requires to make significant estimate and assumption these estimate and assumption primarily include but are not limited to the selection of appropriate peer

although we believe our estimate of fair value are reasonable actual financial result could differ from those estimate due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimate change in assumption concerning future financial result or other underlying assumption could have significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting unit the amount of any goodwill impairment charge or both we also compared the sum of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the company fair value implied by the market value of the company equity and debt security this comparison indicated that in total our assumption and estimate were reasonable however future decline in the overall market value of the company equity and debt security may indicate that the fair value of one or more reporting unit ha declined below it carrying value our reporting unit fair value exceeded their carrying amount ranging from approximately to more than see note goodwill and other intangible asset to the consolidated financial statement for additional information indefinite lived intangible asset are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to it carrying value if the carrying value of the asset exceeds it estimated fair value an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written to it estimated fair value our indefinite lived intangible asset fair value is

the carrying value of account receivable and trade account payable approximated their respective fair value due to their short term nature table of content commitment and contingency the company is involved in legal proceeding and is subject to investigation inspection audit inquiry and similar action by governmental authority arising in the normal course of the company business including the

consolidated financial position however substantial unanticipated verdict fine and ruling do sometimes occur result the company could from time to time incur judgment enter into settlement or revise it expectation regarding the outcome of certain matter and such development could have material adverse effect on it result of operation in the period in which the amount are accrued and or it cash

those legal claim for which management concludes that it is probable that loss will be incurred and that the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated substantially all of these contingency are subject to significant uncertainty and therefore determining the likelihood of loss and or the measurement of any loss can be complex with respect to litigation and other legal proceeding where the company ha determined that loss is reasonably possible the company is unable to estimate the amount or range of reasonably possible loss in excess of amount reserved due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of and uncertainty regarding such litigation and legal proceeding the company assessment are based on estimate and assumption that have been deemed reasonable by management but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate and unanticipated event and circumstance may occur that might cause the company to change those estimate and assumption therefore it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more pending litigation or other contingency could have material adverse effect on the company consolidated financial statement in future fiscal period management assessment of current litigation and other legal proceeding including the corresponding accrual could change because of the discovery of fact with respect to legal action or other proceeding pending
