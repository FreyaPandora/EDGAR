the quarter in which reservation are booked have recognized most of our gross profit the consumer travel or dining experience is completed beginning january we will recognize revenue for our travel reservation service on check in basis such that revenue will be recognized upon check in at an accommodation pick of rental car or boarding of flight in either case result of this timing difference between when advertising expense is incurred and revenue or gross profit is recognized advertising expense may not be recognized in the period the associated revenue or gross profit competition we compete globally with both online and traditional travel and restaurant reservation and related service the market for the service we offer are and are expected to remain intensely competitive and current and new competitor can launch new service at relatively low cost of our current and potential competitor such google apple alibaba tencent amazon and facebook have access to significantly greater and more diversified resource than we do and may be able to leverage other aspect of their business search or mobile device business to enable them to compete more effectively with for example google ha entered various aspect of the online travel market including by establishing flight meta search product google flight and hotel meta search business google hotel ad that are growing rapidly well it book on google reservation functionality and it google trip app we currently or may potentially in the future compete with variety of company including online travel reservation service such

company offering new rental car business model or car or ride sharing service that affect demand for rental car some of which have developed innovative technology to improve efficiency of point to

solution to accommodation provider including large global distribution system or gd such amadeus and sabre google the world largest search engine and one of the world largest company and other large established company with substantial resource and expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating internet traffic have launched search meta search and or reservation booking service and may create additional inroad into online travel google travel meta search service google hotel ad and google flight are growing rapidly and have achieved significant market share in relatively short time meta search service leverage their search technology to aggregate travel search result for the consumer specific itinerary across travel service provider accommodation rental car company or airline otc and other travel website and in many instance compete directly with for customer meta search service intend to appeal to consumer by showing broader travel search result than may be available through otcs or other travel website which could lead to travel service provider or others gaining larger share of search traffic tripadvisor and trivago two other leading meta search company support their meta search service with significant brand and performance advertising through our kayak meta search service we compete directly with other meta search service further meta search service may evolve into more traditional otcs by offering consumer the ability to make travel reservation directly through their website for example tripadvisor allows consumer to make reservation on tripadvisor at some accommodation through it instant booking offering which includes participation by many of the leading global hotel chain ha been proliferation of new channel through which accommodation provider can offer reservation for example company such airbnb and homeaway which is owned by expedia offer service providing alternative accommodation property owner particularly individual an online place to list their accommodation where traveler can search and book such property and compete directly with our alternative accommodation service in addition airbnb ha begun offering hotel reservation through it online and mobile platform travel service provider including hotel chain rental car company and airline with which we conduct business compete with in online channel to drive consumer to their own website in lieu of third party distributor such travel service provider may charge lower price and in some instance offer advantage such loyalty point or special discount to member of closed user group such loyalty program participant or customer with registered account any of which could make their offering more attractive to consumer than our service further consolidation among travel service provider such marriott international acquisition of starwood hotel resort could result in lower rate of commission paid to otcs increased discounting and greater incentive for consumer to join closed user group such travel service provider expand their offering google android operating system is the leading smartphone operating system in the world result google could leverage it android operating system to give it travel service competitive advantage either technically or with prominence on it google play app store or within it mobile search result further google is the leading internet search service and ha leveraged it search popularity to promote it travel meta search service similarly apple the producer of among other thing the iphone and ipad obtained patent for itravel mobile app that would allow traveler to check in for travel reservation in addition apple iphone operating system includes wallet virtual wallet app that hold ticket boarding pass coupon and gift card and along with itravel may be indicative of apple intent to enter the travel reservation business in some capacity apple ha substantial market share in the smartphone category and control integration of offering including travel service into it mobile operating system apple also ha more experience producing and developing mobile apps and ha access to greater resource than we have apple may use expand and or integrate itravel wallet siri apple voice recognition concierge service apple pay apple mobile payment system or another mobile app or functionality mean of entering the travel reservation marketplace to the extent apple or google use their mobile operating system app distribution channel or in the case of google search service to favor their own travel service offering our business and result of operation could be harmed and technology our business is supported by multiple system and platform which designed with an emphasis on scalability performance and reliability the platform are generally independent among our brand though some system have become increasingly connected or shared our software platform and architecture use variety of widely used software tool and database system these internal platform were designed to include open application protocol interface that can provide connectivity to vendor in the industry in which we operate these include large global system such accommodation airline ticket and rental car reservation system and financial service provider well individual accommodation service provider such individual hotel our application utilize digital certificate to help conduct secure communication and transaction appropriate the system infrastructure and web and database server of our worldwide operation are primarily hosted in the united kingdom switzerland the netherlands germany singapore hong kong and four location in the united state each of which provides network connectivity networking infrastructure and hour monitoring and engineering support typical of hosted data center all data center facility have continuous power supply system generator redundant server and multiple back up system although we take step to mitigate the effect of any loss or reduction in service at one of our hosting facility if hosting facility were inaccessible or otherwise experienced disruption in service for any reason we could experience disruption to our service loss of transaction and revenue and consumer complaint we provide customer service through mix of in house call center and outsourced third party service intellectual property over time and through acquisition we have assembled portfolio of patent trademark service mark copyright domain name and trade secret covering our service we regard the protection of our intellectual property critical to our success we protect our intellectual property right by relying on national federal state and common law right in the united state and internationally well variety of administrative procedure regulation convention and treaty we also rely on contractual restriction to protect our proprietary right in our service we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreement with employee and contractor and nondisclosure agreement with party with we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information we also have procured various intellectual property license from third party we deem appropriate we pursue the registration of our intellectual property such domain name trademark and service mark in the united state and internationally we currently hold various issued patent and pending patent application we file additional patent application on new invention we deem appropriate effective trademark copyright patent domain name trade dress and trade secret protection is expensive to maintain and may require litigation we continue to expand internationally protecting our intellectual property right and other proprietary right involves an increasing number of jurisdiction process that is expensive and time consuming and may not be successful in every location see part item risk factor we face risk related to our intellectual property seasonalitya meaningful amount of our gross booking are generated early in the year customer plan and reserve their spring and summer vacation in europe and north america however historically we generally have not recognized revenue from these booking the travel is completed on check which can be in quarter other than when the reservation is booked beginning on january we began recognizing revenue for financial reporting purpose in our financial statement when the travel begin on check in which can also be in quarter other than when the reservation is booked in contrast we expense the substantial majority of our advertising activity the expense is incurred which in the case of performance advertising in particular is typically in the quarter in which associated reservation are booked result of this potential timing difference between when we record advertising expense and when we recognize associated revenue we have historically experienced our highest level of profitability in the second and third quarter of the year which is when we experience the highest level of accommodation check out for the year for our european and north american business we expect this to continue under our new revenue recognition policy the first quarter of the year is typically our lowest level of profitability and may experience volatility in earnings growth rate due to these and other seasonal timing factor for our asia pacific business we experience the highest level of accommodation booking in the third and fourth quarter of the year and the highest level of travel consumption in the fourth quarter the relative growth rate for these business fluctuate the quarterly distribution of our operating result may vary recent year we experienced an expansion of the booking window the average time between the making of travel reservation and the travel which impact the relationship between our gross booking recognized at the time of booking and our revenue and gross profit recognized at the time of check out or after january at the time of check in recently we have seen modest contraction of the booking window future change in the booking window may cause additional difference between our gross booking growth rate and revenue growth rate upon adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard for period beginning after december the timing of revenue recognition for travel reservation service will change for example revenue for accommodation reservation service which is primarily recognized at check out under the current accounting standard will change to be recognized at check in under the new revenue standard we currently expect this timing change will not have significant impact to our annual revenue and net income although the effect on quarterly revenue and net income are expected to be more significant because meaningful amount of travel typically start in december each year and is completed in january of the following year under the new revenue standard this revenue will be recognized in the fourth quarter each year rather than the first quarter of the following year therefore we estimate that revenue will be more than lower in first quarter of slightly le than lower in second and third quarter of and higher in fourth quarter of recognized at check in it is under the new revenue standard than it would have been if recognized at check out it would have been under the current accounting standard in addition the date on which certain holiday fall can have an impact on our quarterly result for example in our second quarter year over year growth rate in revenue gross profit operating income and operating margin were positively impacted by easter falling in the second quarter instead of the first quarter it in conversely our first quarter year over year growth rate in revenue gross profit operating income and operating margin were adversely impacted by easter falling in the second quarter instead of the first quarter it did in similar to in easter will fall in the second quarter instead of the first quarter however because easter will be on april and we expect that meaningful amount of easter travel will commence in the week leading up to easter which is during the first quarter we expect that easter will have negative effect on our second quarter year over year growth rate and positive effect on our first quarter year over year growth rate due to the change in our revenue recognition policy from check out to check in the timing of other holiday such chinese new year carnival and ramadan can also impact our quarterly year over year growth rate the impact of seasonality can be exaggerated in the short term by the gross booking growth rate of the business for example in period where our gross booking growth rate substantially decelerates our operating margin typically benefit from relatively le variable advertising expense in addition gross profit growth is typically le impacted by decelerating gross booking growth in the near term due to the benefit of revenue related to reservation booked in previous quarter conversely in period where our gross booking growth rate accelerates our operating margin are typically negatively impacted by relatively more variable advertising expense in addition gross profit growth is typically le impacted by accelerating gross booking growth in the near term portion of the revenue recognized from such gross booking will occur in future quarter employee of december we employed approximately employee of which approximately were based in the united state and approximately were based outside the united state we also retain independent contractor to support our customer service website content translation and system support function we have never had work stoppage and we consider our relation with our employee to be good although we have work council or employee representative in certain country our employee are not represented by labor union and are not covered by collective bargaining agreement our future success will depend in part on our ability to continue to attract integrate retain and motivate highly qualified technical and managerial personnel for whom competition is intense see part item risk factor we rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business would be harmed website we maintain website with the address www

the following risk factor and other information included in this annual report should be carefully considered the risk and uncertainty described are not the one we face additional risk and uncertainty not presently known to or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business result of operation or financial condition if any of the following risk occur our business financial condition operating result and cash flow could be materially adversely affected decline or disruption in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance our financial result and prospect are almost entirely dependent upon the sale of travel service travel including accommodation including hotel motel resort home apartment bed and breakfast hostel and other property rental car and airline ticket reservation is significantly dependent on discretionary spending level result sale of travel service tend to decline during general economic downturn and recession and time of political or economic uncertainty consumer engage in le discretionary spending are concerned about unemployment or inflation have reduced access to credit or experience other concern or effect that reduce their ability or willingness to travel perceived or actual adverse economic condition including slow slowing or negative economic growth unemployment rate inflation and weakening currency and concern over government response such higher tax and reduced government spending could impair consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand political uncertainty condition or event such the united kingdom decision to leave the european union brexit and concern regarding certain member with sovereign debt default risk can also negatively affect consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand at time we have experienced volatility in transaction growth rate increased cancellation rate and weaker trend in hotel average daily rate adrs across many region of the world particularly in those country that appear to be most affected by economic and political uncertainty which we believe are due at least in part to these macro economic condition and concern economic or political disruption could cause contribute to or be indicative of deteriorating macro economic condition which in turn could negatively affect travel to or from such country or the travel industry in general and therefore have an adverse impact on our result of operation while lower occupancy rate have historically resulted in accommodation provider increasing their distribution of accommodation reservation through third party intermediary such our remuneration for accommodation reservation transaction change proportionately with price and therefore lower average daily rate generally have negative effect on our accommodation reservation business and negative effect on our gross profit these and other macro economic uncertainty such oil price geopolitical tension and differing central bank monetary policy have led to significant volatility in the exchange rate between the dollar and the euro the british pound sterling and other currency significant fluctuation in currency exchange rate stock market and oil price can also impact consumer travel behavior for example although lower oil price may lead to increased travel activity consumer have more discretionary fund and airline fare decrease decline in oil price may be indicative of broader macro economic weakness which in turn could negatively affect the travel industry and our business since the united kingdom brexit vote global market and foreign exchange rate have experienced increased volatility including decline in the value of the british pound sterling compared to the dollar upon leaving the european union among other thing the united kingdom could lose access to the single european union market and travel between the united kingdom and european union country could be restricted we could face new regulatory cost and challenge if regulation and policy diverge from those of the european union since the timing and term of the united kingdom exit from the european union are uncertain we are unable to predict the effect brexit will have on our business including the effect on non citizen employed by in the united kingdom and result of operation the united kingdom decision to leave the european union could result in other member country also determining to leave which could lead to added economic and political uncertainty and devaluation or eventual abandonment of the euro common currency any of which could have negative impact on travel and therefore our business and result of operation the uncertainty of macro economic factor and their impact on consumer behavior which may differ across region make it more difficult to forecast industry and consumer trend and the timing and degree of their impact on our market and business which in turn could adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our business and adversely affect our result of operation in addition unforeseen event beyond our control such oil price stock market volatility terrorist attack unusual or extreme weather or natural disaster such earthquake hurricane tsunami flood drought and volcanic eruption related health concern including pandemic and epidemic such ebola zika and mers political instability change in economic condition regional hostility imposition of tax or surcharge by regulatory authority change in trade or immigration policy or travel related accident can disrupt travel or otherwise result in decline in travel demand because these event or concern and the full impact of their effect are largely unpredictable they can dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior by consumer and therefore demand for our service which can adversely affect our business and result of operation for example our business and operation have been negatively impacted by terrorist attack hurricane harvey and irma which disrupted travel in the southeastern united state and part of the caribbean respectively in august and the coup attempt in turkey in july also european country respond to an increased flow of migrant from the middle east travel between country within the european union and to and from the region could be subject to increased restriction or the closing of border which could negatively impact travel to from or within the european union and adversely affect our business and result of operation certain jurisdiction particularly in europe are considering regulation intended to address the issue of overtourism including by restricting access to city center or popular tourist destination or limiting accommodation offering in surrounding area such by restricting construction of new hotel or the renting of home or apartment such regulation could adversely affect travel to or our ability to offer accommodation in such market which could negatively impact our business growth and result of operation the united state ha implemented or proposed or is considering various travel restriction and action that could affect trade policy or practice which could also adversely affect travel to or from the united state future terrorist attack natural disaster health concern civil or political unrest or other event outside our control could disrupt our business and operation and adversely affect our result of operation intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance we compete globally with both online and traditional travel and restaurant reservation and related service the market for the service we offer are intensely competitive and current and new competitor can launch new service at relatively low cost some of our current and potential competitor such google apple alibaba tencent amazon and facebook have access to significantly greater and more diversified resource than we do and they may be able to leverage other aspect of their business search or mobile device business to enable them to compete more effectively with for example google ha entered various aspect of the online travel market including by establishing flight meta search product google flight and hotel meta search product google hotel ad that are growing rapidly well it book on google reservation functionality and it google trip app we currently or may potentially in the future compete with variety of company including online travel reservation service such expedia hotel com hotwire orbitz travelocity wotif cheaptickets ebookers hotelclub ratestogo and carrentals com which are owned by expedia hotel reservation service hr and hotel de which are owned by hotel reservation service and autoeurope cartrawler ctrip in which we

operated by alibaba com hoteltonight cheapoair and edreams odigeo online accommodation search and or reservation service such airbnb homeaway which is owned by expedia and tujia in which ctrip and expedia hold investment currently focused primarily on alternative accommodation including individually owned property such home and apartment large online company including search social networking and marketplace company such google facebook alibaba tencent amazon and baidu traditional travel agency travel management company wholesaler and tour operator many of which combine physical location telephone service and online service such carlson wagonlit american express bcd travel concur which is owned by sap thomas cook tui and hotelbeds which acquired tourico and gta in well thousand of individual travel agency around the world travel service provider such accommodation provider rental car company and airline many of which have their own branded website to which they drive business including large hotel chain such marriott international hilton and hyatt hotel well joint effort by travel service provider such room key an online hotel reservation service owned by several major hotel company online travel search and price comparison service generally referred to meta search service such google flight google hotel ad tripadvisor trivago in which expedia hold majority interest qunar which is controlled by ctrip skyscanner in which ctrip hold majority interest and hotelscombined online restaurant reservation service such tripadvisor lafourchette yelp seatme zomato bookatable which is owned by michelin quandoo which is owned by recruit and resy in which airbnb hold minority interest company offering new rental car business model or car or ride sharing service that affect demand for rental car some of which have developed innovative technology to improve efficiency of point to point transportation and extensively utilize mobile platform such uber lyft gett zipcar which is owned by avis blablacar didi chuxing grab and ola and company offering technology service and software solution to accommodation provider including large global distribution system or gd such amadeus and sabre google the world largest search engine and one of the world largest company and other large established company with substantial resource and expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating internet traffic have launched search meta search and or reservation booking service and may create additional inroad into online travel google travel meta search service google hotel ad and google flight are growing rapidly and have achieved significant market share in relatively short time meta search service leverage their search technology to aggregate travel search result for the consumer specific itinerary across travel service provider accommodation rental car company or airline online travel company otc and other travel website and in many instance compete directly with for customer meta search service intend to appeal to consumer by showing broader travel search result than may be available through otcs or other travel website which could lead to travel service provider or others gaining larger share of search traffic google leverage it general search business to promote it meta search offering by showing meta search result at the top of it organic search result further tripadvisor and trivago two other leading meta search company support their meta search service with significant brand and performance advertising through our kayak meta search service we compete directly with other meta search service kayak depends on access to information related to travel service pricing schedule availability and other related information from otcs and travel service provider to the extent otcs or travel service provider do not provide such information to kayak kayak business and result of operation could be harmed consumer may favor travel service offered by meta search website or search company over otcs which could reduce traffic to our travel reservation website increase consumer awareness of our competitor brand and website and increase our advertising and other customer acquisition cost to the extent any such consumer behavior lead to growth in our kayak meta search business such growth may not result in sufficient increase in profit from our kayak meta search business to offset any related decrease in profit experienced by our otc brand further meta search service may evolve into more traditional otcs by offering consumer the ability to make travel reservation directly through their website for example tripadvisor allows consumer to make reservation at some accommodation while staying on tripadvisor through it instant booking offering which includes participation by many of the leading global hotel chain we have been participating in instant booking since however such participation may not result in substantial incremental booking and could cannibalize business that would otherwise come to through other ad offering on tripadvisor directly including after consumer first visit tripadvisor or through other channel some of which may be more profitable to than reservation generated through instant booking to the extent consumer book travel service through service such tripadvisor instant booking google book on google meta search website or directly with travel service provider after visiting meta search website or meta search utility on traditional search engine without using an otc like or if meta search service limit our participation within their search result or evolve into more traditional otcs we may need to increase our advertising or other customer acquisition cost to maintain or grow our reservation booking and our business and result of operation could be adversely affected there ha been proliferation of new channel through which accommodation provider can offer reservation for example company such airbnb and homeaway which is owned by expedia offer service providing alternative accommodation property owner particularly individual an online place to list their accommodation where traveler can search and book such property and compete directly with our alternative accommodation service in addition airbnb ha begun offering hotel reservation through it online and mobile platform further meta search service may lower the cost for new company to enter the market by providing distribution channel without the cost of promoting the new entrant brand to drive consumer directly to it website if any of these service are successful in attracting consumer would otherwise use our service our business and result of operation would be harmed we believe that providing an extensive collection of property excellent customer service and an intuitive easy to use website or mobile experience are important factor influencing consumer decision to make reservation for many consumer particularly in certain market the price of the travel service is the primary factor determining whether consumer will book reservation result it is increasingly important to offer travel service such hotel room rate at competitive price whether through discount coupon closed user group rate or loyalty program or otherwise discounting and couponing coupled with high degree of consumer shopping behavior is particularly common in asian market while brand loyalty in such market can be le important in some case our competitor are willing to make little or no profit on transaction or offer travel service at loss in order to gain market share if we are unable to effectively compete in these market our market share business and result of operation could be materially adversely affected travel service provider including hotel chain rental car company and airline with which we conduct business compete with in online channel to drive consumer to their own website in lieu of third party distributor such travel service provider may charge lower price and in some instance offer advantage such loyalty point or special discount to member of closed user group such loyalty program participant or consumer with registered account any of which could make their offering more attractive to consumer than our service for example many large hotel chain have instituted additional initiative such increased discounting and incentive to encourage consumer to book accommodation directly through their website discounting may increase competition authority seek to allow increased pricing flexibility among provider of travel service reservation we may need to offer similar advantage to maintain or grow our reservation booking which could adversely impact our profitability further consolidation among travel service provider such marriott international acquisition in of starwood hotel resort could result in lower rate of commission paid to otcs increased discounting and greater incentive for consumer to join closed user group such travel service provider expand their offering if we are not effective our competitor including hotel chain in offering discounted price to closed user group or if we are unable to entice member of our competitor closed user group to use our service our ability to grow and compete could be harmed we are exposed to fluctuation in currency exchange rate we conduct substantial majority of our business outside the united state but we report our result in dollar result we face exposure to movement in currency exchange rate the financial result of our international business are translated from local currency principally euro and british pound sterling into dollar throughout the dollar strengthened significantly year over year relative to substantially all currency in which we transact most notably the euro brazilian real british pound sterling russian ruble and australian dollar in the dollar continued to be stronger year over year relative to the british pound sterling russian ruble and many other major currency in which we transact after the brexit referendum in the united kingdom in june the dollar strengthened significantly the british pound sterling result of these currency exchange rate change in and our foreign currency denominated net asset gross booking an operating and statistical metric referring to the total dollar value generally inclusive of all tax and fee of all travel service booked by our customer net of cancellation gross profit operating expense and net income were lower expressed in dollar in the euro british pound sterling and certain other currency in which we transact strengthened against the dollar if the dollar were to strengthen our foreign currency denominated net asset gross booking gross profit operating expense and net income when expressed in dollar would decrease recent year have seen significant volatility in the exchange rate between the euro the british pound sterling the dollar and other currency significant fluctuation in currency exchange rate can affect consumer travel behavior for example the strengthening of the dollar relative to the euro in made it more expensive for european to travel to the united state and the dramatic depreciation of the russian ruble in and made it more expensive for russian to travel to europe and most other non ruble destination consumer traveling from country whose currency ha weakened against other currency may book lower adr accommodation choose to shorten or cancel their international travel plan or choose to travel domestically rather than internationally any of which could adversely affect our gross booking revenue and result of operation in particular when expressed in dollar additionally foreign exchange rate fluctuation on transaction denominated in currency other than the functional currency result in gain and loss that are reflected in our financial result volatility in foreign exchange rate and it impact on consumer behavior which may differ across region make it more difficult to forecast industry and consumer trend and the timing and degree of their impact on our market and business which in turn could adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our business and our result of operation face risk related to the growth rate and the global expansion of our business we derive substantial portion of our revenue and have significant operation outside the united state our international business include the netherlands based accommodation reservation service booking com the asia based accommodation reservation service agoda com the based rental car reservation service rentalcars com which began operating part of booking com on january and to lesser extent kayak international meta search service and opentable international restaurant reservation business our international otc operation have achieved significant year over year growth in their gross booking these growth rate which have contributed significantly to our growth in consolidated revenue gross profit and earnings have declined trend we expect to continue the absolute level of our gross booking increase other factor may also slow the growth rate of our international business including for example worldwide or regional economic condition strengthening of the dollar versus the euro the british pound sterling and other currency decline in adrs increase in cancellation adverse change in travel market condition and the competitiveness of the market decline in the growth rate of our international business could have negative impact on our revenue and earnings growth rate and consequence our stock price our strategy involves continued expansion in region throughout the world many of these region have different economic condition custom language currency consumer expectation level of consumer acceptance and use of the internet for commerce legislation regulatory environment including labor law and custom tax law and level of political stability and we are subject to associated risk typical of international business international market may have strong local competitor with an established brand and travel service provider or restaurant relationship that may make expansion in that market difficult and costly and take more time than anticipated in addition compliance with legal regulatory or tax requirement in multiple jurisdiction place demand on our time and resource and we may nonetheless experience unforeseen and potentially adverse legal regulatory or tax consequence in some market such china legal and other regulatory requirement may prohibit or limit participation by foreign business such by making foreign ownership or management of internet or travel related business illegal or difficult or may make direct participation in those market uneconomic which could make our entry into and expansion in those market difficult or impossible require that we work with local partner or result in higher operating cost if we are unsuccessful in rapidly expanding in new and existing market and effectively managing that expansion our business and result of operation could be adversely affected certain market in which we operate that are in earlier stage of development have lower operating margin compared to more mature market which could have negative impact on our overall margin these market increase in size over time also we intend to continue to invest in adding accommodation available for reservation on our website such hotel motel resort home apartment and other unique place to stay many of the newer accommodation we add to our travel reservation service especially in highly penetrated market may have fewer room or higher credit risk and may appeal to smaller subset of consumer hostel and bed and breakfast because alternative accommodation are often either single unit or small collection of independent unit these property generally represent more limited booking opportunity than hotel motel and resort which generally have more unit to rent per property further alternative accommodation in general may be subject to increased seasonality due to local tourism season weather or other factor or may not be available at peak time due to use by the property owner and we may also experience lower profit margin with respect to these property due to certain additional cost related to offering these accommodation on our website we increase our alternative accommodation business these different characteristic could negatively impact our profit margin and to the extent these property represent an increasing percentage of the property added to our website we expect that our gross booking growth rate and property growth rate will continue to diverge over time since each such property ha fewer booking opportunity result of the foregoing the percentage of alternative accommodation property increase the number of reservation per property will likely continue to decrease in addition our alternative accommodation reservation business grows we may incur increasing number of complaint related to non existent property or property that are significantly different than described in the listing well claim of liability based on event occurring at such property such robbery injury death and other similar event such complaint or claim could result in negative publicity and increased cost which could adversely affect our reputation business and result of operation further the regulatory environment related to some alternative accommodation such home and apartment is evolving and law regulation or property association rule could impose restriction or burden on these property owner that limit or negatively affect their ability to rent their property some jurisdiction have adopted or are considering statute or ordinance that prohibit owner and manager from renting certain property for fewer than stated number of consecutive day or for more than an aggregate total number of day per year in addition several jurisdiction have adopted or are considering adopting statute or ordinance requiring online platform that list certain alternative accommodation to obtain license to list such accommodation and or to comply with other restriction or requirement such regulation could negatively impact the growth and or size of our alternative accommodation reservation business believe that the increase in the number of accommodation provider that participate on our website and the corresponding access to accommodation room night ha been key driver of the growth of our accommodation reservation business the growth in our accommodation booking typically make an attractive source of consumer demand for our accommodation provider however accommodation provider may wish to limit the amount of business that flow through single distribution channel also certain jurisdiction particularly in europe are considering regulation intended to address the issue of overtourism including by restricting accommodation offering in city center or near popular tourist destination such by restricting construction of new hotel or the renting of home or apartment such restriction could also include limiting the number of tourist permitted to visit and stay near popular area during peak season or general matter result we may experience constraint on the number of listing or accommodation room night actually available to which could negatively impact our growth rate and result of operation the number of our employee worldwide ha grown from approximately of december to approximately of december which growth is mostly comprised of hire by our international operation we may not be able to hire train retain motivate and manage required personnel which may limit our growth damage our reputation negatively affect our financial performance and otherwise harm our business in addition expansion increase the complexity of our business and place additional strain on our management operation technical performance financial resource and internal financial control and reporting function our current and planned personnel system procedure and control may not be adequate to support and effectively manage this growth and our future operation especially we employ personnel in multiple geographic location around the world we rely on performance and brand advertising channel to generate significant amount of traffic to our website and grow our business we believe that maintaining and strengthening our brand are important aspect of our effort to attract and retain customer we have invested considerable money and resource in the establishment and maintenance of our brand and we will continue to invest resource in brand advertising marketing and other brand building effort to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brand in addition effective performance advertising ha been an important factor in our growth and we believe it will continue to be important to our future success our competitor spend increasingly more on advertising we are required to spend more in order to maintain our brand recognition and in the case of performance advertising to maintain and grow traffic to our website through performance advertising channel we may not be able to successfully maintain or enhance consumer awareness and acceptance of our brand and even if we are successful in our branding effort such effort may not be cost effective for instance we have observed increased brand advertising by otcs meta search service and travel service provider particularly in north america and europe which may make our brand advertising effort more expensive and le effective if we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness and acceptance of our brand in cost effective manner our business market share and result of operation would be materially adversely affected our online performance advertising efficiency expressed performance advertising expense percentage of gross profit is impacted by number of factor that are subject to variability and that are in some case outside of our control including adrs cost per click cancellation rate foreign exchange rate our ability to convert paid traffic to booking customer and the extent to which consumer come directly to our website or mobile apps for booking for example competition for desired ranking in search result and or decline in ad click by consumer could increase our cost per click and reduce our performance advertising efficiency we use third party website including online search engine primarily google meta search and travel research service and affiliate marketing primary mean of generating traffic to our website our performance advertising expense ha increased significantly and our performance advertising efficiency ha declined in recent year trend we expect to continue though the rate of decrease may fluctuate and there may be period of stable or increasing roi from time to time further at time we may pursue strategy of increasing performance advertising roi which could negatively affect our gross booking and gross profit growth rate any reduction in our performance advertising efficiency could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation whether through reduced revenue or revenue growth or through advertising expense increasing faster than revenue and thereby reducing margin and earnings growth we believe that number of factor could cause consumer to increase their shopping activity making travel purchase increased shopping activity reduces our performance advertising efficiency and effectiveness because traffic becomes le likely to result in reservation through our website and such traffic is more likely to be obtained through paid performance advertising channel than through direct channel further consumer may favor travel service offered by search or meta search company over otcs which could reduce traffic to our travel reservation website increase consumer awareness of our competitor brand and website increase our advertising and other customer acquisition cost and adversely affect our business margin and result of operation to the extent any such increased shopping behavior lead to growth in kayak meta search business such growth may not result in sufficient increase in gross profit from our kayak meta search business to offset any related decrease in gross profit or increase in advertising and other customer acquisition cost experienced by our otc brand our business could be negatively affected by change in internet search and meta search algorithm and dynamic or traffic generating arrangement we use google to generate significant portion of the traffic to our website and to lesser extent we use other search and meta search website to generate traffic to our website principally through pay per click advertising campaign the pricing and operating dynamic on these search and meta search website can experience rapid change commercially technically and competitively for example google frequently update and change the logic which determines the placement and display of result of consumer search such that the placement of link to our website can be negatively affected and our cost to improve or maintain our placement in search result can increase in june the european commission fined google billion euro for breaching european union antitrust rule by giving it comparison shopping service priority placement in google search result google ha appealed the european commission decision and it is not yet clear or whether the decision will affect google ranking of it travel meta search service google flight and google hotel ad in google search result change by google in how it present travel search result including it promotion of it travel meta search service or the manner in which it conduct the auction for placement among search result may be competitively disadvantageous to and may impact our ability to efficiently generate traffic to our website which in turn would have an adverse effect on our business market share and result of operation similarly change by our other search and meta search partner in how they present travel search result or the manner in which they conduct the auction for placement among search result may be competitively disadvantageous to and may impact our ability to efficiently generate traffic to our website in addition we purchase website traffic from number of other source including some operated by our competitor in the form of pay per click arrangement that can be terminated with little or no notice if one or more of such arrangement is terminated our business market share and result of operation could be adversely affected we rely on various third party distribution channel marketing affiliate to distribute accommodation rental car and airline ticket reservation should one or more of such third party cease distribution of reservation made through or suffer deterioration in it search or meta search ranking due to change in search or meta search algorithm or otherwise our business market share and result of operation could be negatively affected we may not be able to keep up with rapid technological change the market in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standard consolidation frequent new service announcement introduction and enhancement and changing consumer demand we may not be able to keep up with these rapid change in addition these market characteristic are heightened by the progress of technology adoption in various market including the continuing adoption of the internet and online commerce in certain geography and the emergence and growth of the use of smartphones and tablet for mobile commerce transaction including through the increasing use of mobile apps new development in other area such cloud computing could make entering our market easier for competitor due to lower upfront technology cost result our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technology to adapt our service and online platform to evolving industry standard and to continually innovate and improve the performance feature and reliability of our service and online platform in response to competitive service offering and the evolving demand of the marketplace in particular it is increasingly important for to effectively offer our service on mobile device through mobile apps and mobile optimized website any failure by to successfully develop and achieve customer adoption of our mobile apps and mobile optimized website would have material and adverse effect on our growth market share business and result of operation further to the extent mobile device enable user to block advertising content on their device our advertising revenue and our ability to market our brand and acquire new customer may be negatively affected we believe that ease of use comprehensive functionality and the look and feel of our mobile apps and mobile optimized website are increasingly competitively critical consumer obtain more of their travel and restaurant service through mobile device result we intend to continue to spend significant resource maintaining developing and enhancing our website and mobile platform including our mobile optimized website and mobile apps and other technology and platform further technical innovation often result in bug and other system failure any such bug or failure especially in connection with significant technical implementation or change could result in lost business harm to our brand or reputation customer complaint and other adverse consequence any of which could adversely affect our business and result of operation furthermore the overall size of our business ha grown the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass wider range of service and technology including service and technology that may be outside of our historical core business and our ability to keep pace may slow our current and potential competitor range from large and established to emerging start ups emerging start ups may be able to innovate and focus on developing particularly new product or service faster than we can or may foresee consumer need for new service or technology before some of our larger competitor or potential competitor have more resource or more established relationship with consumer than we do and they could use these advantage in way that could affect our competitive position including by making acquisition entering or investing in travel reservation business investing in research and development and competing aggressively for highly skilled employee in addition the widespread adoption of new internet networking or telecommunication technology or other technological change including new device and service such amazon echo and alexa and google home and developing technology such artificial intelligence chatbot and virtual reality technology could require to incur substantial expenditure to modify or adapt our service or infrastructure to those new technology which could adversely affect our result of operation or financial condition any failure to implement or adapt to new technology in timely manner or at all could adversely affect our ability to compete increase our customer acquisition cost or otherwise adversely affect our business and therefore adversely affect our brand market share and result of operation our processing storage use and disclosure of personal data expose to risk of internal or external security breach and could give rise to liability the security of data when engaging in electronic commerce is essential to maintaining consumer and travel service provider confidence in our service any security breach whether instigated internally or externally on our system or other internet based system could significantly harm our reputation and therefore our business brand market share and result of operation we currently require consumer who use certain of our service to guarantee their offer with their credit card we require user name and password in order to access our information technology system we also use encryption and authentication technology to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent unauthorized access to our data or account it is possible that computer circumvention capability new discovery or advance or other development including our own act or omission could result in compromise or breach of consumer data for example third party may attempt to fraudulently induce employee travel service provider partner or customer to disclose user name password or other sensitive information phishing which may in turn be used to access our information technology system or to defraud our partner or customer we have experienced targeted and organized phishing attack and may experience more in the future these risk are likely to increase we expand our offering integrate our product and service and store and process more data including personal information our effort to protect information from unauthorized access may be unsuccessful or may result in the rejection of legitimate attempt to book reservation through our service any of which could result in lost business and materially adversely affect our business reputation and result of operation our existing security measure may not be successful in preventing security breach party whether internal external an affiliate or unrelated third party that is able to circumvent our security system could steal consumer information or transaction data or other proprietary information in the last year several major company experienced high profile security breach that exposed their system and information and or their customer or employee personal information we expend significant resource to protect against security breach and we may need to increase our security related expenditure to maintain or increase our system security or to address problem caused and liability incurred by breach these issue are likely to become more difficult to manage we expand the number of place where we operate and the number and variety of service we offer and the tool and technique used in such attack become more advanced security breach could result in severe damage to our information technology infrastructure including damage that could impair our ability to offer our service or the ability of consumer to make reservation or conduct search through our service well loss of customer financial or other data that could materially and adversely affect our ability to conduct our business satisfy our commercial obligation or meet our public reporting requirement in timely fashion or at all security breach could also result in negative publicity damage our reputation expose to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability subject to regulatory penalty and sanction or cause consumer to lose confidence in our security and choose to use the service of our competitor any of which would have negative effect on our brand market share result of operation and financial condition our insurance policy carry low coverage limit and would likely not be adequate to reimburse for all loss caused by security breach we also face risk associated with security breach affecting third party conducting business over the internet consumer generally are concerned with security and privacy on the internet and any publicized security problem could negatively affect consumer willingness to provide private information or effect commercial transaction on the internet generally including through our service some of our business is conducted with third party marketing affiliate which may generate travel reservation through our infrastructure or through other system additionally consumer using our service could be affected by security breach at third party such travel service provider payroll provider health plan provider payment processor or gd upon which we rely security breach at any such third party marketing affiliate travel service payment processor gd or other third party on which we rely such the security breach experienced by sabre in may could be perceived by consumer security breach of our system and in any event could result in negative publicity subject to notification requirement damage our reputation expose to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and subject to regulatory penalty and sanction in addition such third party may not comply with applicable disclosure requirement which could expose to liability in our processing of travel transaction we receive and store large volume of personally identifiable data this data is increasingly subject to legislation and regulation in numerous jurisdiction around the world such the european union data protection directive and variation and implementation of that directive in the member state of the european union in addition in april the european union adopted new general data protection regulation designed to unify data protection within the european union under single law which ha resulted and will result in significantly greater compliance burden and cost for company with user and operation in the european union under the general data protection regulation fine of up to million euro or up to of the annual global revenue of the infringer whichever is greater could be imposed this government action is typically intended to protect the privacy of personal data that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction in many case these law apply not only to third party transaction but also to transfer of information between and our subsidiary including employee information the general data protection regulation will go into effect and apply to beginning in may in the united kingdom data protection bill ha been introduced in parliament that if adopted would substantially implement the european union general data protection regulation in the united kingdom in february and authority announced that they had reached agreement on new data transfer framework called the privacy shield which wa formally adopted by the european commission on july the european union and the united state are implementing the new framework but it is currently subject to legal challenge these law and their interpretation continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction non compliance with these law could result in penalty or significant legal liability we could be adversely affected if legislation or regulation are expanded to require change in our business practice or if governing jurisdiction interpret or implement their legislation or regulation in way that negatively affect our business result of operation or financial condition we are also subject to payment card association rule and obligation under our contract with payment card processor under these rule and obligation if information is compromised we could be liable to payment card issuer for associated expense and penalty in addition if we fail to follow payment card industry security standard even if no customer information is compromised we could incur significant fine or experience significant increase in payment card transaction cost system capacity constraint system failure or denial of service or other attack could harm our business we have experienced rapid growth in consumer traffic to our website and through our mobile apps the number of accommodation on our extranets and the geographic breadth of our operation if our system can not be expanded to cope with increased demand or fail to perform we could experience unanticipated disruption in service slower response time decreased customer service and customer satisfaction and delay in the introduction of new service any of which could impair our reputation damage our brand and materially and adversely affect our result of operation further an online business we are dependent on the internet and maintaining connectivity between and consumer source of internet traffic such google and our travel service provider and restaurant consumer increasingly turn to mobile device we also become dependent on consumer access to the internet through mobile carrier and their system disruption in internet access such the denial of service attack against dyn in october that resulted in service outage for number of major internet company whether generally in specific market or otherwise especially if widespread or prolonged could materially adversely affect our business and result of operation while we do maintain redundant system and hosting service it is possible that we could experience an interruption in our business and we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate for all loss that may occur our computer hardware for operating our service is currently located at hosting facility around the world these system and operation are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error flood fire power loss telecommunication failure and similar event they are also subject to break in sabotage intentional act of vandalism terrorism and similar misconduct despite any precaution we may take the occurrence of any disruption of service due to any such misconduct natural disaster or other unanticipated problem at such facility or the failure by such facility to provide our required data communication capacity could result in lengthy interruption or delay in our service any system failure that cause an interruption or delay in service could impair our reputation damage our brand result in lost business or result in consumer choosing to use competitive service any of which could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation existing security measure may not be successful in preventing attack on our system and any such attack could cause significant interruption in our operation for instance from time to time we have experienced denial of service type attack on our system that have made portion of our website slow or unavailable for period of time there are numerous other potential form of attack such phishing where third party attempt to infiltrate our system or acquire information by posing legitimate inquiry or electronic communication sql injection where third party attempt to insert malicious code into our software through data entry field in our website in order to gain control of the system and attempting to use our website platform to launch denial of service attack on another party each of which could cause significant interruption in our operation and potentially adversely affect the value of our brand operation and result of operation or involve in legal or regulatory proceeding we expend significant resource in an attempt to prepare for and mitigate the effect of any such attack reduction in website availability and response time could cause loss of substantial business volume during the occurrence of any such attack on our system and measure we may take to divert suspect traffic in the event of such an attack could result in the diversion of bona fide customer these issue are likely to become more difficult to manage we expand the number of place where we operate and the variety of service we offer and the tool and technique used in such attack become more advanced successful attack could result in negative publicity damage our reputation and prevent consumer from booking travel service researching travel service or making restaurant reservation through during the attack any of which could cause consumer to use the service of our competitor which would have negative effect on the value of our brand our market share business and result of operation we rely on certain third party computer system and third party service provider including gd and computerized central reservation system of the accommodation rental car and airline industry in connection with providing some of our service any interruption in these third party service and system or deterioration in their performance could prevent from booking related accommodation rental car and airline reservation and have material adverse effect on our business brand and result of operation our agreement with some third party service provider are terminable upon short notice and often do not provide recourse for service interruption in the event our arrangement with any such third party is terminated we may not be able to find an alternative source of system support on timely basis or on commercially reasonable term and result it could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation we depend upon various third party to process payment including credit card for our merchant transaction around the world in addition we rely on third party to provide credit card number which we use payment mechanism for merchant transaction if any such third party were wholly or partially compromised our cash flow could be disrupted or we may not be able to generate merchant transaction and related revenue until such time replacement process could be put in place with different vendor we do not have completely formalized or comprehensive disaster recovery plan in every geographic region in which we conduct business in the event of certain system failure we may not be able to switch to back up system immediately and the time to full recovery could be prolonged like many online business we have experienced system failure from time to time in addition to placing increased burden on our engineering staff these outage create significant amount of consumer question and complaint that need to be addressed by our customer support personnel any unscheduled interruption in our service could result in an immediate loss of revenue that could be substantial increase customer service cost harm our reputation and result in some consumer switching to our competitor if we experience frequent or persistent system failure our reputation and brand could be permanently and significantly harmed we have taken and continue to take step to increase the reliability and redundancy of our system these step are expensive may reduce our margin and may not be successful in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime we use both internally developed system and third party system to operate our service including transaction processing order management and financial system if the number of consumer using our service increase substantially or if critical third party system stop operating designed we will need to significantly expand and upgrade our technology transaction processing system financial and accounting system and other infrastructure we may not be able to upgrade our system and infrastructure to accommodate such condition in timely manner and depending on the third party system affected our transactional financial and accounting system could be impacted for meaningful amount of time before upgrade expansion or repair consumer adoption and use of mobile device creates challenge and may enable device company such apple to compete directly with widespread adoption of mobile device such the iphone android enabled smartphones and tablet such the ipad coupled with the web browsing functionality and development of thousand of useful apps available on these device is driving substantial online traffic and commerce to mobile platform we have experienced significant shift of business both direct and indirect to mobile platform and our advertising partner are also seeing rapid shift of traffic to mobile platform some competitor offer last minute discount for mobile accommodation reservation advertising and distribution may be more limited on mobile device given their smaller screen size the gross profit earned on mobile transaction may be le than typical desktop transaction due to different consumer purchasing pattern for example accommodation reservation made on mobile device typically are for shorter length of stay and are not made far in advance further given the device size and technical limitation of tablet and smartphones mobile consumer may not be willing to download multiple apps from multiple company providing similar service and instead prefer to use one or limited number of apps for their mobile travel and restaurant research and reservation activity result the consumer experience with mobile apps well brand recognition and loyalty are likely to become increasingly important our mobile offering have received generally strong review and are driving material and increasing share of our business we believe that mobile booking present an opportunity for growth and are necessary to maintain and grow our business consumer increasingly turn to mobile device instead of personal computer result it is increasingly important for to develop and maintain effective mobile apps and website optimized for mobile device to provide consumer with an appealing easy to use mobile experience if we are unable to continue to rapidly innovate and create new user friendly and differentiated mobile offering and efficiently and effectively advertise and distribute on these platform or if our mobile offering are not used by consumer we could lose market share to existing competitor or new entrant and our business future growth and result of operation could be adversely affected google android operating system is the leading smartphone operating system in the world result google could leverage it android operating system to give it travel service competitive advantage either technically or with prominence on it google play app store or within it mobile search result further google is the leading internet search service and ha leveraged it search popularity to promote it travel meta search service similarly apple the producer of among other thing the iphone and ipad obtained patent for itravel mobile app that would allow traveler to check in for travel reservation in addition apple iphone operating system includes wallet virtual wallet app that hold ticket boarding pass coupon and gift card and along with itravel may be indicative of apple intent to enter the travel reservation business in some capacity apple ha substantial market share in the smartphone category and control integration of offering including travel service into it mobile operating system apple also ha more experience producing and developing mobile apps and ha access to greater resource than we have apple may use or expand itravel wallet siri apple voice recognition concierge service apple pay apple mobile payment system or another mobile app or functionality mean of entering the travel reservation marketplace to the extent google or apple use their mobile operating system app distribution channel or in the case of google search service to favor their own travel service offering our business and result of operation could be harmed we may have exposure to additional tax liability an international business providing reservation and advertising service around the world we are subject to income tax and non income based tax in the united state and various international jurisdiction due to economic and political condition tax rate and tax regime in various jurisdiction may be subject to significant change our future effective tax rate could be affected by change in the mix of earnings in country with differing statutory tax rate change in the valuation of deferred tax asset or change in tax law or their interpretation if our effective tax rate were to increase our result of operation and cash flow would be adversely affected although we believe that our tax filing position are reasonable and comply with applicable law the final determination of tax audit or tax dispute may be different from is reflected in our historical income tax provision and accrual to date we have been audited in many taxing jurisdiction with no significant impact on our result of operation financial condition or cash flow if future audit find that additional tax are due we may be subject to incremental tax liability possibly including interest and penalty which could have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and cash flow for example french tax authority conducted an audit that started in of the tax year through the french tax authority are asserting that booking com ha permanent establishment in france and are seeking to recover what they claim are unpaid income tax and value added tax in december the french tax authority issued assessment related to these tax year for approximately million euro the majority of which represents penalty and interest we believe that booking com ha been and continues to be in compliance with french tax law and we are contesting the assessment our objection to the assessment wa denied by the french tax authority if we are unable to resolve the matter with the french tax authority we expect to challenge the assessment in the french court in order to challenge the assessment in court we may be required to pay upfront the full amount or significant part of any such assessment though such payment would not constitute an admission by that we owe the tax alternatively any resolution or settlement of the matter with the french tax authority may also require payment part of such resolution or settlement french tax authority have begun similar audit of the tax year through which could result in additional assessment general government are increasingly focused on way to increase tax revenue which ha contributed to an increase in audit activity and harsher stance taken by tax authority any such additional tax or other assessment may be in excess of our current tax provision or may require to modify our business practice in order to reduce our exposure to additional tax going forward any of which could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition in december the tax cut and job act the tax act wa enacted into law in the united state the tax act made significant change to federal tax law including reduction in the federal statutory tax rate from to effective january and exempts from federal income tax international profit distributed to the united state the tax act imposes one time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on unremitted accumulated international earnings to be paid over eight year the company international cash and investment of december amounting to billion well future cash generated by our international operation can be repatriated to the without further federal income tax see note to our consolidated financial statement for more information regarding our estimation of future tax liability the tax act also includes provision effective after december allowing the immediate write of the cost of certain investment in depreciable asset imposing limit on the deduction for net interest expense changing the deductibility of covered officer compensation and changing the rule on the use of net operating loss the tax act also introduces tax on of global intangible low taxed income which is income determined to be in excess of specified routine rate of return the tax act further introduces base erosion and anti abuse tax aimed at preventing the erosion of the tax base and new tax on foreign derived intangible income the tax law change made by the tax act are broad and complex and there are significant uncertainty about how the tax act will be interpreted at both the federal and state level and limited guidance is available from tax authority at this time the interpretation and implementation of the tax act and regulation rule or guidance that may be adopted under or resulting from the tax act could materially change the provisional tax that we recognized in and the expected future impact of the tax act on our business additionally in october the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd issued final report in connection with it base erosion and profit shifting beps project the oecd with the support of the initiated this project in in response to concern that international tax standard have not kept pace with change in global business practice and that change are needed to international tax law to address situation where multinational business may pay little or no tax in certain jurisdiction by shifting profit away from jurisdiction where the activity creating those profit take place the final report were endorsed by the leader in november the final report propose action the oecd determined are needed to address base erosion and profit shifting including enhancing transparency through the sharing of tax information between country prescribing standardized country by country reporting and other documentation requirement aimed at identifying where profit tax and economic activity occur preventing harmful tax practice including the use of preferential tax regime modernizing the oecd transfer pricing rule related to intangible changing the definition of permanent establishment to prevent artificial avoidance of tax nexus and limiting tax base erosion through interest deduction and other financial payment the measure have among other thing resulted in the development of multilateral instrument mli to incorporate and facilitate change to tax treaty in june number of country signed the mli on january the european commission unveiled new package of proposal aimed at providing framework for fairer taxation and to provide coordinated european union response to combating corporate tax avoidance following agreement among the european union member state on the final content of the package the european council formally adopted an anti tax avoidance directive in july which wa further amended in february the directive is aimed at preventing aggressive tax planning increasing tax transparency and creating fairer tax environment for all business in the european union further the oecd task force on the digital economy is also working on an interim report for the due in early and is considering potential idea to address the tax challenge of the digital economy including interim solution such an alternative levy on electronic sale several eu member state have recently also proposed the concept of an equalization tax to the eu commission that would seek to tax the turnover of digital company in press release dated october the european council concluded that the european union need an effective and fair taxation system for the digital era to ensure global level playing field in line with the work being carried out at the oecd and that it is also anticipating eu commission proposal on this subject early in we expect many country to change their tax law in response to these development and several country have already changed or proposed change to their tax law in response to the final beps report and or the development in the european union any change to international tax law including new definition of permanent establishment or change affecting the benefit of preferential tax regime such the dutch innovation box tax discussed below could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings and adversely impact our effective tax rate further change to tax law and additional reporting requirement could increase the complexity burden and cost of compliance due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activity any change in or taxation of our activity or the combined effect of tax law in multiple jurisdiction including the united state may increase our worldwide effective tax rate increase the complexity and cost associated with tax compliance especially if change are implemented or interpreted inconsistently across tax jurisdiction and adversely affect our cash flow and result of operation we are also subject to non income based tax such value added payroll sale use net worth property and good and service tax in the united state and various international jurisdiction well the potential for travel transaction tax in the united state discussed below and in note to our consolidated financial statement from time to time we are under audit by tax authority with respect to these non income based tax and may have exposure to additional non income based tax liability we may not be able to maintain our innovation box tax benefit the netherlands corporate income tax law provides that income generated from qualifying innovative activity prior to is taxed at the rate of innovation box tax rather than the dutch statutory rate of portion of booking com earnings currently qualifies for innovation box tax treatment in the year ended december the innovation box tax benefit reduced our consolidated income tax expense by approximately million in order to be eligible for innovation box tax treatment booking com must among other thing apply for and obtain an certificate from dutch governmental agency every six month confirming that the activity that booking com intends to be engaged in over the subsequent six month period are innovative the certificate is current but should booking com fail to secure such certificate in any future period for example because the governmental agency doe not view booking com new or anticipated activity innovative or should this agency determine that the activity contemplated to be performed in prior period were not performed contemplated or did not comply with the agency requirement booking com may lose it certificate and result the innovation box tax benefit may be reduced or eliminated booking com intends to apply for continued innovation box tax treatment for future period however booking com application may not be accepted or if accepted the amount of qualifying earnings may be reduced furthermore the dutch government introduced change to it income tax law that increased the innovation box tax rate to beginning in the dutch government ha also proposed commencing in incrementally reducing over time the corporate income tax statutory rate from to by if this proposal is enacted into law we expect the combined effect of these two change to slightly increase our effective tax rate during the first two year of the income tax transition period and slightly reduce it thereafter the loss of the innovation box tax benefit or any material portion thereof whether due to change in tax law or determination by the dutch government that booking com activity are not innovative or for any other reason would substantially increase our effective tax rate and adversely impact our result of operation and cash flow adverse application of state and local tax law could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation number of jurisdiction in the united state have initiated lawsuit against online travel company including related to among other thing the payment of travel transaction tax hotel occupancy tax excise tax sale tax etc in addition number of state county and municipality have initiated audit proceeding issued proposed tax assessment or started inquiry relating to the payment of travel transaction tax additional state and local jurisdiction may assert that we are subject to among other thing travel transaction tax and could seek to collect such tax either retroactively or prospectively or both in many of the judicial and other proceeding initiated to date the taxing jurisdiction seek not only historical tax that are claimed to be owed on our gross profit but also among other thing interest penalty punitive damage and or attorney fee and cost to date many of the taxing jurisdiction in which we facilitate travel reservation have not asserted that tax are due and payable on our travel service with respect to taxing jurisdiction that have not initiated proceeding to date it is possible that they will do so in the future or that they will seek to amend their tax statute and seek to collect tax from only on prospective basis in connection with some travel transaction tax audit and assessment we may be required to pay any assessed tax which amount may be substantial prior to being allowed to contest the assessment and the applicability of the law in judicial proceeding payment of these amount if any is not an admission that we are subject to such tax and even if we make such payment we intend to continue to assert our position that we should not be subject to such tax is subject to uncertainty and there could be adverse development in these pending or future case and proceeding adverse tax decision could have material adverse effect on our business margin cash flow and result of operation an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending litigation may encourage the commencement of additional litigation audit proceeding or other regulatory inquiry in addition an unfavorable outcome or settlement of these action or proceeding could result in substantial liability for past and or future booking including among other thing interest penalty punitive damage and or attorney fee and cost we are dependent on provider of accommodation rental car and airline ticket and on restaurant we rely on provider of accommodation rental car and airline ticket and on restaurant to make their service available to consumer through our arrangement with travel service provider generally do not require them to make available any specific quantity of accommodation reservation rental car or airline ticket or to make accommodation reservation rental car or airline ticket available in any geographic area for any particular route or at any particular price similarly our arrangement with restaurant generally do not require them to provide all of their available table and reservation to customer through we are in regular dialogue with our major travel service provider about the nature and extent of their participation in our service significant reduction on the part of any of our major travel service provider or provider that are particularly popular with consumer in their participation in our service for sustained period of time or their complete withdrawal could have material adverse effect on our business market share and result of operation to the extent any of those major or popular travel service provider ceased to participate in our service in favor of one of our competitor system or decided to require consumer to purchase service directly from them our business market share and result of operation could be harmed during period of higher occupancy rate accommodation provider may decrease their distribution of accommodation reservation through third party intermediary like in particular through our discount service such priceline com express deal and name your own price service further consolidation among travel service provider increase the potential adverse effect of decision by any particular significant travel service provider such large hotel chain airline or rental car company to withdraw from or reduce it participation in our service also increase to the extent restaurant limit the availability of reservation through opentable consumer may not continue to use our service and or our revenue could be adversely affected especially if reservation during highly desirable time on high volume day are not made available through kayak meta search service depends on access to information related to travel service pricing schedule availability and other related information from otcs and travel service provider to attract consumer to obtain this information kayak maintains relationship with travel service provider and otcs many of kayak agreement with travel service provider and otcs are short term agreement that may be terminated on day notice to the extent otcs or travel service provider no longer provide such information to kayak kayak ability to provide comprehensive travel service information to consumer could be diminished and it brand business and result of operation could be harmed to the extent consumer do not view kayak reliable source of comprehensive travel service information fewer consumer would likely visit it website which would also likely have negative impact on kayak advertising revenue and result of operation in addition if travel service provider or otcs choose not to advertise with kayak or choose to reduce or eliminate the fee paid to kayak for referral from query result kayak business and result of operation could be adversely affected we rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business would be harmed our performance is largely dependent on the talent and effort of highly skilled individual our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all area of our organization in particular the contribution of key senior management in the united state europe and asia are critical to the overall management of our business we may not be able to retain the service of any member of our senior management or other key employee the loss of whom could harm our business and competitive position in addition competition for well qualified employee in all aspect of our business including software engineer mobile communication talent and other technology professional is intense both in the united state and abroad our international success in particular ha led to increased effort by our competitor and others to hire our international employee these difficulty may be amplified by evolving restriction on immigration travel or availability of visa or work permit for skilled technology worker our continued ability to compete effectively and to innovate and develop product service technology and enhancement depends on our ability to attract new employee and to retain and motivate existing employee if we do not succeed in attracting well qualified employee or retaining and motivating existing employee our business competitive position and result of operation would be adversely affected we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy the size of our business grows we may become increasingly subject to the scrutiny of anti trust competition and consumer protection regulator the online travel industry ha become the subject of investigation by various national competition authority ncas particularly in europe we are or have been involved in investigation predominantly related to whether booking com contractual parity arrangement with accommodation provider sometimes also referred to most favored nation or mfn provision are anti competitive because they require accommodation provider to provide booking com with room rate that are at least low those offered to other otcs or through the accommodation provider website some investigation relate to other issue such reservation and cancellation clause commission payment and pricing behavior for instance on september the swiss price surveillance office opened an investigation into the level of commission of booking com in switzerland investigation into booking com parity provision were initiated in and by ncas in france germany italy austria sweden ireland and switzerland number of other ncas have also looked at these issue on april the french italian and swedish ncas working in close cooperation with the european commission announced that they had accepted commitment offered by booking com to resolve and close the investigation in france italy and sweden under the commitment booking com replaced it existing price parity agreement with accommodation provider with narrow price parity agreement under narrow price parity agreement subject to certain exception an accommodation provider is still required to offer the same or better rate on booking com it offer to consumer directly online but it is no longer required to offer the same or better rate on booking com it offer to other otcs the commitment also allow an accommodation provider to among other thing offer different term and condition free wifi and availability to consumer that book with online travel company that offer lower rate of commission or other benefit offer lower rate to consumer that book through offline channel and continue to discount through among other thing accommodation loyalty program long those rate are not published or marketed online the commitment apply to accommodation in france italy and sweden and were effective on july the foregoing description is summary only and is qualified in it entirety by reference to the commitment published by the ncas on april on july booking com voluntarily implemented the commitment given to the french italian and swedish ncas throughout the european economic area and switzerland nearly all ncas in the european economic area have closed their investigation following booking com implementation of the commitment in their jurisdiction booking com also agreed in with the ncas in australia new zealand and georgia to implement the narrow price parity clause in these country however the australian nca indicated in february that it is reassessing narrow price parity clause between online travel agency and accommodation provider in january the turkish nca imposed fine on booking com following an investigation into booking com wide parity clause further to the turkish nca decision booking com ha also implemented the narrow price parity clause in turkey we are in ongoing discussion with various ncas in other country regarding their concern we are currently unable to predict the long term impact the implementation of these commitment will have on booking com business on investigation by other country or on industry practice more generally on december the german nca issued final decision prohibiting booking com narrow price parity agreement with accommodation in germany the german nca did not issue fine but ha reserved it position regarding an order for disgorgement of profit booking com is appealing the german nca decision an italian hotel association ha appealed the italian nca decision to accept the commitment by booking com working group of european ncas france germany belgium hungary ireland italy the netherlands czech republic the united kingdom and sweden wa established by the european commission in december to monitor the effect of the narrow price parity clause in europe this working group the ecn working group issued questionnaire during to online travel agency including booking com and expedia meta search site and hotel about the narrow price parity clause on april the ecn working group published the result of this monitoring exercise the report indicates that the introduction of the narrow price parity clause generally improved condition for competition although neither the european commission any of the participating ncas ha opened new investigation following the publication of the report the ecn working group decided to keep the sector under review and ass the competitive situation in due course we are unable to predict how these appeal and the remaining investigation in other country will ultimately be resolved or whether further action in europe will be taken result of the ecn working group ongoing review possible outcome include requiring booking com to amend or remove it rate parity clause from it contract with accommodation provider in those jurisdiction and or the imposition of fine number of european country have adopted legislation making price parity agreement illegal and it is possible other country may adopt similar legislation in the future for example in august french legislation known the macron law became effective among other thing the macron law make price parity agreement illegal including the narrow price parity agreement agreed to by the french nca in april legislation prohibiting narrow price parity agreement became effective in austria on december and in italy on august motion calling on the swiss government to introduce legislation prohibiting the narrow price parity clause wa approved by the swiss parliament on september in july belgian government minister announced plan to put forward similar proposal before the belgian parliament it is not yet clear how the macron law the austrian and italian legislation or the proposed swiss or belgian legislation may affect our business in the long term further the european commission published communication in may on the mid term review on the implementation of the digital single market strategy part of the digital single market strategy the commission is due to present in the first quarter of proposal for legislation addressing relationship between online platform and business including dispute resolution and transparency in search ranking consumer protection issue including platform search ranking are also being reviewed by european ncas the united kingdom nca launched consumer law investigation into the clarity accuracy and presentation of information on hotel booking site with specific focus on the display of search result claim regarding discount method of pressure selling such creating false impression regarding room availability and failure to disclose hidden charge consumer protection compliance review of car rental booking website by the nca is also ongoing the consumer protection department of the german nca announced the opening of sector inquiry into online price comparison site in various sector including travel and hotel on october the finnish nca ha also recently carried out consumer survey and issued questionnaire to hotel in order to gather information about online hotel booking platform we are unable to predict what if any effect such action will have on our business industry practice or online commerce more generally to the extent that regulatory authority impose fine on or require change to our business practice or to those currently common to the industry our business competitive position and result of operation could be materially and adversely affected negative publicity regarding competition investigation could adversely affect our brand and therefore our market share and result of operation further the macron law the italian and austrian law and any similar legislation enacted by other country and the decision by the german nca to prohibit narrow price parity agreement could have material adverse effect on our business and our result of operation in particular if consumer use our service to shop for accommodation reservation but make their reservation directly with an accommodation provider competition related investigation legislation or issue could also give rise to private litigation for example booking com is involved in private litigation in sweden related to it narrow price parity provision we are unable to predict how this litigation will be resolved or whether it will impact booking com business in sweden in addition our business grows we may increasingly become the target of competition investigation or be limited by anti trust or competition law for example our size and market share may negatively affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval of proposed acquisition our ability to expand into complementary business or our latitude in dealing with travel service provider such by limiting our ability to provide discount rebate or incentive or to exercise contractual right any of which could adversely affect our business result of operation or ability to grow and compete regulatory and legal requirement and uncertainty could harm our business the service we offer are subject to legal regulation including law ordinance rule and other requirement and regulation of national and local government and regulatory authority around the world many of which are evolving and subject to the possibility of new or revised interpretation our ability to provide our service is and will continue to be affected by such regulation for example in our rentalcars com business began offering optional rental car related insurance product to customer protecting them against accidental damage to their rental vehicle which subject to certain insurance regulation and related increased compliance cost and complexity any of which could negatively impact our business and result of operation similarly law in some country relating to data localization payment processing registration travel agent and other local requirement could if applicable to adversely affect our ability to conduct business in those country the implementation of unfavorable regulation or unfavorable interpretation of existing regulation by judicial or regulatory body could require to incur significant compliance cost cause the development of the affected market to become impractical and otherwise have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation for example in march in connection with lawsuit begun in by the association of turkish travel agency claiming that booking com is required to meet certain registration requirement in turkey turkish court ordered booking com to suspend turkish hotel and accommodation to turkish resident although booking com is appealing the order and belief it to be without basis this order ha had and is likely to continue to have negative impact on our growth and result of operation certain jurisdiction particularly in europe are considering regulation intended to address the issue of overtourism including restriction that may adversely affect our ability to offer accommodation in particular alternative accommodation near city center or popular tourist destination to the extent any such regulation require online platform such to comply with additional restriction related to offering reservation for accommodation tour and activity or other travel service in such area we could be subject to increased legal and compliance cost and our business growth and result of operation could be adversely affected compliance with the law and regulation of multiple jurisdiction increase our cost of business these law and regulation which vary and sometimes conflict include the foreign corrupt practice act the bribery act and local law which also prohibit corrupt payment to governmental official or third party data privacy requirement labor relation law tax law anti trust or competition law or sanctioned country or sanctioned person mandate and consumer protection law violation of these law and regulation could result in fine and or criminal sanction against our officer or our employee and or prohibition on the conduct of our business any such violation could result in prohibition on our ability to offer our service in one or more country could delay or prevent potential acquisition and could also materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion effort our ability to attract and retain employee our business and our operating result even if we comply with these law and regulation doing business in certain jurisdiction could harm our reputation and brand which could adversely affect our result of operation or stock price in addition these restriction may provide competitive advantage to our competitor unless they are also subject to comparable restriction our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risk and manage these difficulty we are also subject to variety of other regulatory and legal risk and challenge in managing an organization operating in various country including those related to regulatory change or other government action additional complexity to comply with regulation in multiple jurisdiction well overlapping or inconsistent legal regime in particular with respect to tax labor consumer protection digital content advertising promotion privacy and anti trust law difficulty in transferring fund from or converting currency in certain country and reduced protection for intellectual property right in some country our business ha grown substantially over the last several year and continues to expand into new geographic location in addition we have made effort and expect to make further effort to integrate access to travel service across our various brand these change add complexity to legal and tax compliance and our increased size and operating history may increase the likelihood that we will be subject to regulatory scrutiny or audit by tax authority in various jurisdiction our stock price is highly volatile the market price of our common stock is highly volatile and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuation in response to factor such the following some of which are beyond our control operating result that vary from the expectation of security analyst and investor quarterly variation in our operating result change in expectation to our future financial performance including financial estimate by security analyst and investor worldwide economic condition in general and in europe in particular fluctuation in currency exchange rate particularly between the dollar and the euro occurrence of significant security breach announcement of technological innovation or new service by or our competitor change in our capital structure change in market valuation of other internet or online service company announcement by or our competitor of price reduction promotion significant contract acquisition strategic partnership joint venture or capital commitment loss of major travel service provider participant such hotel chain rental car company or airline from our service change in the status of our intellectual property right lack of success in the expansion of our business model geographically business interruption such may result from natural disaster or other event announcement by third party of significant claim or initiation of litigation proceeding against or adverse development in pending proceeding addition or departure of key personnel and trading volume fluctuation sale of substantial number of share of our common stock including through the conversion of our convertible note could adversely affect the market price of our common stock by introducing large number of seller to the market given the volatility that exists for our share such sale could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly in addition fluctuation in our stock price and our price to earnings multiple may have made our stock attractive to momentum hedge or day trading investor who often shift fund into and out of stock rapidly exacerbating price fluctuation in either direction particularly when viewed on quarterly basis the trading price of internet company stock in general including ours have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuation to the extent that the public perception of the prospect of internet or commerce company is negative our stock price could decline regardless of our result other broad market and industry factor may decrease the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance market fluctuation well general political and economic condition such recession interest rate or currency rate fluctuation political instability brexit and the july coup attempt in turkey or natural disaster or terrorist attack affecting significant market for our business such europe or the united state could cause our stock price to decline negative market condition could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital or the value of our stock for purpose of acquiring other company or business we have in the past been defendant in security class action litigation security class action litigation ha often been brought against company following period of volatility in the market price of it security to the extent our stock price decline or is volatile we may in the future be the target of additional litigation this additional litigation could result in substantial cost and divert management attention and resource either of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation we face increased risk the level of our debt increase we have substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness and we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future including through public or private offering of debt security our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur may have significant consequence which could include requiring the dedication of portion of our cash flow from operation to service our indebtedness thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purpose including capital expenditure share repurchase and acquisition increased vulnerability to downturn in our business to competitive pressure and to adverse change in general economic and industry condition decreased or lost ability to obtain additional financing on term acceptable to for working capital capital expenditure acquisition share repurchase or other general corporate purpose and decreased flexibility when planning for or reacting to change in our business and industry our ability to make payment of principal of and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic condition industry cycle and financial business and other factor affecting our consolidated result of operation and financial condition many of which are beyond our control further we may not have access to equity or debt market or other source of financing or such financing may not be available to on commercially reasonable term to repay or refinance our debt it come due or in the case of our convertible note upon conversion we face risk related to our intellectual property we regard our intellectual property critical to our success and we rely on domain name trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality and or license agreement with our employee travel service provider partner and others to protect our proprietary right we have filed various application for protection of certain aspect of our intellectual property in the united state and other jurisdiction and we currently hold number of issued patent in several jurisdiction further in the future we may acquire additional patent or patent portfolio which could require significant cash expenditure however we may choose not to patent or otherwise register some of our intellectual property and instead rely on trade secret or other mean of protecting our intellectual property we have licensed in the past and may license in the future certain of our proprietary right such trademark or copyrighted material to third party and these licensee may take action that diminish the value of our proprietary right or harm our reputation we also have procured various intellectual property license from third party in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our service are made available online we may be required to expend significant time and resource to prevent infringement or to enforce our intellectual property right we believe that our intellectual property right including our issued patent and pending patent application help to protect our business we endeavor to defend our intellectual property right diligently but intellectual property litigation is extremely expensive and time consuming and may divert managerial attention and resource from our business objective we may not be able to successfully defend our intellectual property right or they may not be sufficient to effectively protect our business which could materially adversely affect our business brand and result of operation from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we have been subject to and are currently subject to legal proceeding and claim relating to the intellectual property right of others and we expect that third party will continue to assert intellectual property claim in particular patent claim against particularly we expand the complexity and scope of our business successful infringement claim against could result in significant monetary liability or prevent from operating our business or portion of our business in addition resolution of claim may require to obtain license to use intellectual property right belonging to third party which may be expensive to procure or possibly to cease using those right altogether any of these event could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition the success of our acquisition of opentable is subject to numerous risk and uncertainty on july we acquired opentable leading brand for booking online restaurant reservation we believe that the online restaurant reservation business is complementary to our online travel business and that both opentable and our travel business benefit from the addition of opentable to booking holding result of our acquisition of opentable we are subject to risk associated with opentable business many of which are the same risk that our other business face other risk include opentable ability to increase the number of restaurant and diner using it product and service and retain existing restaurant and diner opentable ability to expand internationally competition both to provide reservation management service to restaurant and to attract diner to make reservation through opentable website and apps opentable ability to effectively and efficiently market to new restaurant and diner and any risk that cause people to refrain from dining at restaurant such economic downturn severe weather outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease or threat of terrorist attack opentable post acquisition strategy wa premised on significant and rapid investment in international expansion and various other growth initiative resulting in near term reduced earnings and profit margin but with the goal of achieving significantly increased revenue and profitability in the long term this strategy wa achieving limited progress in the third quarter of opentable modified it strategy result while opentable intends to continue to pursue and invest in international expansion and it other growth initiative it intends to do so in more measured and deliberate manner this change in strategy resulted in opentable updating it forecasted financial result to reflect material reduction in forecasted term financial result from these initiative partially offset by improved earnings and profit margin in the near term result of the reduced investment previously disclosed based on the updated forecast we estimated significant reduction in the fair value of the opentable business and for the quarter ended september recognized non deductible goodwill impairment charge of million future event and changing market condition may lead to again re evaluate the assumption reflected in the updated forecast including key assumption regarding opentable expected growth rate and operating margin and the success and timing of it international expansion and other growth initiative well other key assumption with respect to matter outside of our control such discount rate currency exchange rate market ebitda earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization comparables and change in accounting policy or practice including proposed change affecting the measurement of goodwill and or impairment testing methodology if opentable doe not achieve the result currently expected if it investment in particular it investment in it international expansion effort and other growth initiative are not successful or if any of the assumption underlying our estimate of the value of the opentable business including those mentioned prove to be incorrect we may further refine our forecast for the opentable business and recognize an additional goodwill impairment and an impairment of intangible asset which could have material adverse effect on our result of operation the value of our investment could decline which could adversely affect our financial condition and result of operation we maintain an investment portfolio of various holding type and maturity these security are predominantly classified available for sale and consequently are recorded in our balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gain or loss reported component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax our portfolio includes fixed income security and equity security of publicly traded company the value of which are subject to market price volatility if such investment suffer market price decline we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investment below their cost basis when the decline is judged to be other than temporary we have invested significant amount in ctrip convertible note and ad see note to our consolidated financial statement for more information regarding our investment in ctrip security beginning on january change in fair value of our investment in ctrip equity security will be recognized in net income see note to our consolidated financial statement the value of these security is subject to the risk associated with ctrip business well any change by the chinese government in foreign investment law or elevated scrutiny or regulation of foreign investment in chinese company for example because of foreign ownership restriction applicable to it business ctrip is cayman island company operating in china through what is commonly referred to variable interest entity or vie structure where it conduct part of it business through contractual relationship with affiliated chinese entity although vie structure are commonly used by chinese internet and commerce company there are substantial uncertainty regarding the interpretation and application of prc law and regulation to vie structure and it is possible that the prc government may view the vie structure in violation of prc law vie contractual relationship are not effective in providing control over the affiliated chinese company direct ownership and ctrip would have to rely on the prc legal system to enforce those contract in the event of breach by one of these entity further conflict of interest could arise to the extent ctrip officer or director are also shareholder officer or director of the affiliated chinese entity any of these risk could materially and adversely affect ctrip business and therefore the value of our investment in ctrip similar consideration and risk apply in respect of our investment in security of meituan dianping private cayman island company operating in china through vie structure we also invest from time to time in private company and these investment are generally accounted for under the cost method such investment are inherently risky in that such company are typically at an early stage of development may have no or limited revenue may not be or ever become profitable may not be able to secure additional funding or their technology service or product may not be successfully developed or introduced to the market further our ability to liquidate any such investment is typically dependent on liquidity event such public offering or acquisition no public market exists for such security valuation of privately held company are inherently complex and uncertain due to the lack of liquid market for the company security if we determine that any of our investment in such company have experienced decline in value we may be required to record an other than temporary impairment for example in we recognized impairment totaling approximately million related to investment in two private company and in we recognized an impairment of million related to an investment in one private company we could lose the full amount of any of our investment and any impairment of our investment could have material adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operation in new business strategy and acquisition could disrupt our ongoing business and present risk not originally contemplated our mission is to help people experience the world result our strategy involves evaluating and potentially entering complementary business in furtherance of that mission we have invested and in the future may invest in new business strategy and acquisition for example we acquired the momondo group in july to enhance the global reach of our meta search business we entered the restaurant reservation business through our acquisition of opentable in and booking com ha invested in it bookingsuite accommodation service business and ha begun offering activity such tour and museum ticket in various location such endeavor may involve significant risk and uncertainty including distraction of management from current operation greater than expected liability and expense inadequate return on capital new risk with which we are not familiar legal compliance obligation that previously did not apply to integration risk and difficulty and unidentified issue not discovered in our investigation and evaluation of those strategy and acquisition result entering new business involves risk and cost that could if realized have an adverse effect on our business reputation result of operation cash flow or financial condition well on our ability to achieve the expected benefit of any such investment or acquisition we may decide to make minority investment including through joint venture in which we have limited or no management or operational control the controlling person in such case may have business interest strategy or goal that are inconsistent with ours and decision of the company or venture in which we invested may result in harm to our reputation or adversely affect the value of our investment substantial portion of our goodwill and intangible asset were acquired in acquisition if we determine that any of the goodwill and intangible asset or any goodwill or intangible asset acquired in future transaction experience decline in value we may be required to record an other than temporary impairment which could materially adversely affect our result of operation further we may issue share of our common stock in these transaction which could result in dilution to our stockholder our use of open source software could adversely affect our ability to protect our proprietary software and subject to possible litigation we use open source software in connection with our software development from time to time company that use open source software have faced claim challenging the use of open source software and or compliance with open source license term we could be subject to suit by party claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming non compliance with open source licensing term some open source license require user who distribute software containing open source to make available all or part of such software which in some circumstance could include valuable proprietary code of the user while we monitor our use of open source software and try to ensure that none is used in manner that would require to disclose our proprietary source code or that would otherwise breach the term of an open source agreement such use could inadvertently occur in part because open source license term are often ambiguous any requirement to disclose our proprietary source code or pay damage for breach of contract could be harmful to our business result of operation or financial condition and could help our competitor develop service that are similar to or better than ours our business is exposed to risk associated with processing credit card and other payment transaction because we facilitate the processing of customer credit card in many of our transaction including majority of our priceline com agoda com and rentalcars com transaction our result have been negatively impacted by customer purchase made using fraudulent credit card we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit card on our website well other payment dispute with our customer additionally we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit card in certain transaction when we do not facilitate the processing of customer credit card accordingly we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting customer chargebacks if we are unable to combat the use of fraudulent credit card on our website our business result of operation and financial condition could be materially adversely affected our booking com business is also increasingly processing transaction on merchant basis where it facilitates payment including credit card transaction well other global payment method on behalf of customer while this allows booking com to process transaction for property that do not otherwise accept credit card and to increase it ability to offer flexible transaction term to consumer we incur additional payment processing cost chargebacks and other cost related to these transaction this business continues to grow we may experience significant increase in such cost or chargebacks and our result of operation and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition in the event that one of our major travel service provider voluntarily or involuntarily declares bankruptcy we could experience an increase in chargebacks from customer with travel reservation with such travel service provider for example airline that participate in our service and declare bankruptcy or cease operation may be unable or unwilling to ticket sold for their flight our policy in such event is to direct customer seeking refund or exchange to the airline and not to provide remedy ourselves because we process sale of priceline com express deal airline ticket on merchant basis we could experience significant increase in demand for refund or credit card chargebacks from customer which could materially adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition we have in the past experienced an increase in chargebacks from customer with ticket on airline that ceased operation we process credit card transaction and operate in numerous currency credit card and other payment processing cost are typically higher for foreign currency transaction and in instance where cancellation occur cookie law could negatively impact the way we do business cookie is text file that is stored on user web browser by website cooky are common tool used by thousand of website

evaluate certain operating and financial measure on both an reported and constant currency basis we calculate constant currency by converting our current year period financial result for transaction recorded in currency other than dollar using the corresponding prior year period monthly average exchange rate rather than the current year period monthly average exchange rate overviewour mission is to help people experience the world we aim to achieve our mission to help people experience the world through global leadership in online travel and restaurant reservation and related service by providing consumer with the best choice and price at any time in any place on any device making it easy for people to find book and experience their travel desire and providing platform tool and insight to our business partner to help them be successful we operate six primary brand booking com the world leading brand for booking online accommodation reservation based on room night booked priceline com leading hotel rental car airline ticket and vacation package reservation service in the united state kayak leading meta search service allowing consumer to easily search and compare travel itinerary and price including airline ticket accommodation and rental car reservation information from hundred of travel website at once agoda com leading accommodation reservation service catering primarily to consumer in the asia pacific region rentalcars com leading worldwide rental car reservation service opentable leading provider of restaurant reservation and information service to consumer and restaurant reservation management and customer acquisition service to restaurant we refer to our company and all of our subsidiary and brand collectively booking holding the company we our or our business is driven primarily by international result which consist of the result of booking com agoda com and rentalcars com which began operating part of booking com on january and the international business of kayak and opentable this classification is independent of where the consumer resides where the consumer is physically located while using our service or the location of the travel service provider or restaurant for example reservation made through booking com at hotel in new york by consumer in the united state is part of our international result during the year ended december our international business the substantial majority of which is generated by booking com represented approximately of our consolidated gross profit significant majority of our gross profit is earned in connection with facilitating accommodation reservation see note to the consolidated financial statement for more geographic information we derive substantially all of our gross profit from the following source commission earned from facilitating reservation of accommodation rental car and other travel service on an agency basis transaction gross profit on merchant basis and customer processing fee from our accommodation rental car airline ticket and vacation package reservation service advertising revenue primarily earned by kayak from sending referral to online travel company otcs and travel service provider well from advertising placement on kayak website and mobile apps reservation revenue paid by restaurant for diner seated through opentable online reservation service subscription fee for restaurant reservation management service provided by opentable and damage excess waiver fee travel insurance fee and global distribution system gd reservation booking fee in each case related to certain of our travel service our priceline com brand offer merchant name your own price opaque travel service which are recorded in revenue on gross basis and have associated cost of revenue all of our other service are generally recorded in revenue on net basis and have no significant associated cost of revenue therefore revenue increase and decrease are impacted by change in the mix of our revenue between name your own price travel service and other service gross profit reflects the commission or net margin earned for all of our service consequently gross profit is an important measure to evaluate growth in our business because in contrast to our revenue it is not affected by the different method of recording revenue and cost of revenue between our name your own price travel reservation service and our other service on january we adopted new revenue recognition accounting standard which will change the presentation of our name your own price revenue to net basis see note to the consolidated financial statement for period beginning after december and result we will no longer report cost of revenue or gross profit trendsover the last several year we have experienced strong growth in our accommodation reservation service we believe this growth is the result of among other thing the broader shift of travel purchase from offline to online the widespread adoption of mobile device and the growth of travel overall including in higher growth emerging market such asia pacific and south america we also believe this growth is the result of the continued innovation and execution by our team around the world to add accommodation to our travel reservation service increase and improve content build distribution and improve the consumer experience on our website and mobile apps well consistently and effectively marketing our brand through performance and brand advertising effort these year over year growth rate have generally decelerated given the size of our accommodation reservation business we expect that our year over year growth rate will generally continue to decelerate though the rate of deceleration may fluctuate and there may be period of acceleration from time to time our international business represents the substantial majority of our financial result and we expect our operating result and other financial metric to continue to be largely driven by international performance the size of the travel market outside of the united state is substantially greater than that within the united state and recent international online travel growth rate have exceeded and are expected to continue to exceed the growth rate within the united state over the long term we expect that international online travel growth rate will follow similar trend to that experienced in the united state in addition the base of hotel property in europe and asia is particularly fragmented compared to that in the united state where the hotel market is dominated by large hotel chain we believe online reservation system like ours may be more appealing to small chain and independent hotel more commonly found outside of the united state we believe these trend and factor have enabled to become the leading online accommodation reservation service provider in the world measured by room night booked we believe that the opportunity to continue to grow our business exists for the market in which we operate our growth ha primarily been generated by our worldwide accommodation reservation service brand booking com which is our most significant brand and ha been due in part to the availability of large and growing number of instantly bookable property through booking com booking com included approximately property on it website of december consisting of approximately hotel motel and resort and approximately home apartment and other unique place to stay updated property count are available on the booking com website compared to approximately property including approximately hotel motel and resort and approximately home apartment and other unique place to stay of december booking com ha begun categorizing property listed on it website either hotel motel and resort which group together more traditional accommodation type including hostel resort inn and motel or home apartment and other unique place to stay also referred to alternative accommodation which encompasses all other type of accommodation including home apartment villa igloo and beyond booking com previously classified property hotel vacation rental or other we believe the new category are more consistent with those used by other industry participant and allow for more direct comparison of traditional and unique property count among company we intend to continue to invest in adding accommodation available for reservation on our website such hotel motel resort home apartment and other unique place to stay many of the newer accommodation we add to our travel service especially in highly penetrated market may have fewer room or higher credit risk and may appeal to smaller subset of consumer hostel and bed and breakfast because alternative accommodation are often either single unit or small collection of independent unit these property generally represent more limited booking opportunity than hotel motel and resort which generally have more unit to rent per property further alternative accommodation in general may be subject to increased seasonality due to local tourism season weather or other factor or may not be available at peak time due to use by the property owner and we may also experience lower profit margin with respect to these property due to certain additional cost related to offering these accommodation on our website we increase our alternative accommodation business these different characteristic could negatively impact our profit margin and to the extent these property represent an increasing percentage of the property added to our website we expect that our gross booking growth rate and property growth rate will continue to diverge over time since each such property ha fewer booking opportunity result of the foregoing the percentage of alternative accommodation property increase the number of reservation per property will likely continue to decrease we believe that continuing to expand the number and variety of accommodation available through our service in particular booking com will help to continue to grow our accommodation reservation business part of our strategy to increase the number and variety of accommodation available on booking com booking com is increasingly processing transaction on merchant basis where it facilitates payment on behalf of customer this allows booking com to process transaction for property that do not accept credit card and to increase it ability to offer flexible transaction term to consumer such the form and timing of payment we believe that adding these type of property and service offering will benefit our customer and our gross booking room night and earnings growth rate however this result in additional payment processing cost chargebacks and other cost related to these transaction this business continues to grow we may experience significant increase in payment processing cost chargebacks and other cost related to these transaction which are recorded sale and marketing expense in our consolidated statement of operation and which negatively impact our operating margin perceived or actual adverse economic condition including slow slowing or negative economic growth unemployment rate and weakening currency and concern over government response such higher tax and reduced government spending could impair consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand further political uncertainty condition or event such the united kingdom decision to leave the european union brexit and concern regarding certain member with sovereign debt default risk can also negatively affect consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand at time we have experienced volatility in transaction growth rate increased cancellation rate and weaker trend in hotel average daily rate adrs across many region of the world particularly in those country that appear to be most affected by economic and political uncertainty which we believe are due at least in part to these macro economic condition and concern for more detail see part ii item risk factor decline or disruption in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance these and other macro economic uncertainty such geopolitical tension and differing central bank monetary policy have led to significant volatility in the exchange rate between the dollar and the euro the british pound sterling and other currency significant fluctuation in currency exchange rate stock market and oil price can also impact consumer travel behavior noted earlier our international business represents substantial majority of our financial result therefore because we report our result in dollar we face exposure to movement in currency exchange rate the financial result of our international business are translated from local currency principally euro and british pound sterling into dollar result of currency exchange rate change our foreign currency denominated net asset gross booking gross profit operating expense and net income have been positively impacted expressed in dollar for the year ended december compared to the year ended december for example gross profit from our international operation grew for the year ended december compared to the year ended december but without the positive impact of change in currency exchange rate grew year over year on constant currency basis by approximately since our expense are generally denominated in foreign currency on basis similar to our revenue our operating margin have not been significantly impacted by currency fluctuation the aggregate principal value of our euro denominated long term debt and accrued interest thereon provide natural hedge against the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuation on the net asset of certain of our euro functional currency subsidiary for more information see part item risk factor we are exposed to fluctuation in currency exchange rate we generally enter into derivative instrument to minimize the impact of short term currency fluctuation on the translation of our consolidated operating result into dollar however such derivative instrument are short term in nature and not designed to hedge against currency fluctuation that could impact growth rate for our gross booking revenue or gross profit see note to our consolidated financial statement for additional information on our derivative contract compete globally with both online and traditional provider of travel and restaurant reservation and related service the market for the service we offer are intensely competitive and current and new competitor can launch new service to compete with at relatively low cost some of our current and potential competitor such google apple alibaba tencent amazon and facebook have access to significantly greater and more diversified resource than we do and they may be able to leverage other aspect of their business search or mobile device business to enable them to compete more effectively with for example google ha entered various aspect of the online travel market including by establishing flight meta search product google flight and hotel meta search business google hotel ad that are growing rapidly well it book on google reservation functionality and it google trip app our market are also subject to rapidly changing condition including technological development consumer behavior change regulatory change and travel service provider consolidation we expect these trend to continue for example we have experienced significant shift of both direct and indirect business to mobile platform and our advertising partner are also seeing rapid shift of traffic to mobile platform advertising and distribution opportunity may be more limited on mobile device given their smaller screen size in addition the gross profit earned on mobile transaction may be le than typical desktop transaction due to different consumer purchasing pattern for example accommodation reservation made on mobile device typically are for shorter length of stay and are not made far in advance for more detail regarding the competitive trend and risk we face see part item business competition part item risk factor intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance and consumer adoption and use of mobile device creates new challenge and may enable device company such apple to compete directly with and we may not be able to keep up with rapid technological change although we believe that providing an extensive collection of property excellent customer service and an intuitive easy to use website or mobile experience are important factor influencing consumer decision to make reservation for many consumer particularly in certain market the price of the travel service is the primary factor determining whether consumer will book reservation we have observed an increase in promotional pricing to closed user group such loyalty program participant or consumer with registered account including through mobile apps in addition many large hotel chain and otcs have launched initiative such increased discounting and incentive to encourage consumer to book accommodation through their website discounting and couponing coupled with high degree of consumer shopping behavior is particularly common in asian market while brand loyalty in such market is le important in some case our competitor are willing to make little or no profit on transaction or offer travel service at loss in order to gain market share in addition to providing retail travel reservation service our priceline com brand is leading provider of discounted opaque travel reservation service in the united state through it express deal and name your own price offering these discounted service are referred to opaque because certain element of the reservation including the name of the travel service provider are not made known to the traveler until after the reservation is made in general we expect that over time our opaque service will continue to decrease in relative importance to our overall business due we believe to variety of factor including the growth rate of our retail business competition relative complexity travel restriction often required by the travel service provider difficulty in offering certain of these service on mobile device increased discount available to consumer through closed user group or couponing and limited availability of discounted travel reservation from travel service provider particularly during period of high consumer demand we have established widely used and recognized commerce brand through marketing and promotional campaign both our performance and brand advertising expense have increased significantly in recent year trend we expect to continue for the year ended december and our total performance advertising expense wa approximately billion billion and billion respectively primarily related to the use of online search engine primarily google meta search and travel research service and affiliate marketing to generate traffic to our website we also invested approximately million million and million in brand advertising during and respectively primarily related to cost associated with producing and airing television advertising online video advertising for example on youtube and facebook and online display advertising we intend to continue strategy of promoting brand awareness through both online and offline advertising effort including by expanding brand campaign into additional market and we expect our brand advertising expense to increase significantly during we have observed increased brand advertising by otcs meta search service and travel service provider particularly in north america and europe which may make our brand advertising effort more expensive and le effective performance advertising efficiency expressed performance advertising expense percentage of gross profit is impacted by number of factor that are subject to variability and that are in some case outside of our control including adrs cost per click cancellation rate foreign exchange rate our ability to convert paid traffic to booking customer and the extent to which consumer come directly to our website or mobile apps for booking for example competition for desired ranking in search result and or decline in ad click by consumer could increase our cost per click and reduce our advertising efficiency we have also experienced increasing cancellation rate which we expect to continue and which negatively affect our advertising efficiency and result of operation change by google in how it present travel search result including by placing it own offering at or near the top of search result or the manner in which it conduct the auction for placement among search result may be competitively disadvantageous to and may impact our ability to efficiently generate traffic to our website similarly change by our other search and meta search partner in how they present travel search result or the manner in which they conduct the auction for placement among search result may be competitively disadvantageous to and may impact our ability to efficiently generate traffic to our website we have observed long term trend of decreasing performance advertising return on investment roi trend we expect to continue though the rate of decrease may fluctuate and there may be period of stable or increasing roi from time to time in addition we may from time to time we did in the third and fourth quarter of pursue strategy of improving our performance advertising roi which could negatively impact growth and positively impact performance advertising efficiency see part item risk factor we rely on performance and brand advertising channel to generate significant amount of traffic to our website and grow our business and our business could be negatively affected by change in internet search engine algorithm and dynamic or traffic generating arrangement we estimate our effective tax rate for to be approximately which represents our best estimate of our tax expense including the impact of the tax cut and job act the tax act estimated state income tax and international withholding tax on our international earnings and an increase in the innovation box tax rate in the netherlands from to the provision of the tax act are broad and complex and to date there ha been little interpretation or clarification of the act from tax authority result our estimate is based on our current understanding and could change more information becomes available see part item risk factor we may have exposure to additional tax liability and we may not be able to maintain our innovation box tax benefit the national competition authority ncas of many government have conducted or are conducting investigation into competitive practice within the online travel industry and we may be involved or affected by such investigation and their result some country have adopted or proposed legislation that could also affect business practice within the online travel industry for example france and italy among others have adopted legislation making price parity agreement illegal and similar legislation is under consideration in other country for more information on these investigation and their potential effect on our business see note to our consolidated financial statement and part item risk factor the size of our business grows we may become increasingly subject to the scrutiny of anti trust competition and consumer protection regulator in addition to the price parity investigation from time to time ncas other governmental agency trade association and private party take legal action including commencing legal proceeding that may affect our operation for example in march in connection with lawsuit begun in by the association of turkish travel agency claiming that booking com is required to meet certain registration requirement in turkey turkish court ordered booking com to suspend offering turkish hotel and accommodation to turkish resident although booking com is appealing the order and belief it to be without basis this order ha had and is likely to continue to have negative impact on our growth and result of operation seasonalitya meaningful amount of our gross booking are generated early in the year customer plan and reserve their spring and summer vacation in europe and north america however historically we generally have not recognized revenue from these booking until the travel is completed on check out which can be in quarter other than when the reservation is booked beginning on january we began recognizing revenue for financial reporting purpose in our financial statement when the travel begin on check in which can also be in quarter other than when the reservation is booked in contrast we expense the substantial majority of our advertising activity the expense is incurred which in the case of performance advertising in particular is typically in the quarter in which associated reservation are booked result of this potential timing difference between when we record advertising expense and when we recognize associated revenue we have historically experienced our highest level of profitability in the second and third quarter of the year which is when we experience the highest level of accommodation check out for the year for our european and north american business we expect this to continue under our new revenue recognition policy the first quarter of the year is typically our lowest level of profitability and may experience additional volatility in earnings growth rate due to these and other seasonal timing factor for our asia pacific business we experience the highest level of accommodation booking in the third and fourth quarter of the year and the highest level of accommodation check out in the fourth quarter the relative growth rate for these business fluctuate the quarterly distribution of our operating result may vary in recent year we experienced an expansion of the booking window the average time between the making of travel reservation and the travel which impact the relationship between our gross booking recognized at the time of booking and our revenue and gross profit recognized at the time of check out or after january at the time of check in recently have seen modest contraction of the booking window future change in the booking window may cause additional difference between our gross booking growth rate and revenue growth rate upon adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard for period beginning after december the timing of revenue recognition for travel reservation service will change for example revenue for accommodation reservation service which is primarily recognized at check out under the current accounting standard will change to be recognized at check in under the new revenue standard we currently expect this timing change will not have significant impact to our annual revenue and net income although the effect on quarterly revenue and net income are expected to be more significant because meaningful amount of travel typically start in december each year and is completed in january of the following year under the new revenue standard this revenue will be recognized in the fourth quarter each year rather than the first quarter of the following year therefore we estimate that revenue will be more than lower in first quarter of slightly le than lower in second and third quarter of and higher in fourth quarter of recognized at check in it is under the new revenue standard than it would have been if recognized at check out it would have been under the current accounting standard in addition the date on which certain holiday fall can have an impact on our quarterly result for example in our second quarter year over year growth rate in revenue gross profit operating income and operating margin were positively impacted by easter falling in the second quarter instead of the first quarter it did in conversely our first quarter year over year growth rate in revenue gross profit operating income and operating margin were adversely impacted by easter falling in the second quarter instead of the first quarter it did in similar to in easter will fall in the second quarter instead of the first quarter however because easter will be on april and we expect that meaningful amount of easter travel will commence in the week leading up to easter which is during the first quarter we expect that easter will have negative effect on our second quarter year over year growth rate and positive effect on our first quarter year over year growth rate due to the change in our revenue recognition policy from check out to check in the timing of other holiday such chinese new year ramadan and carnival can also impact our quarterly year over year growth rate the impact of seasonality can be exaggerated in the short term by the gross booking growth rate of the business for example in period where our gross booking growth rate substantially decelerates our operating margin typically benefit from relatively le variable advertising expense in addition gross profit growth is typically le impacted by decelerating gross booking growth in the near term due to the benefit of revenue related to reservation booked in previous quarter conversely in period where our gross booking growth rate accelerates our operating margin are typically negatively impacted by relatively more variable advertising expense in addition gross profit growth is typically le impacted by accelerating gross booking growth in the near term portion of the revenue recognized from such gross booking will occur in future quarter other factorswe believe that our future success depends in large part on our ability to continue to profitably grow our brand worldwide and over time to offer other travel and travel related service factor beyond our control such oil price stock market volatility terrorist attack unusual or extreme weather or natural disaster such earthquake hurricane tsunami flood drought and volcanic eruption travel related health concern including pandemic and epidemic such ebola zika and mers political instability change in economic condition regional hostility imposition of tax or surcharge by regulatory authority or travel related accident can disrupt travel or otherwise result in decline in travel demand because these event or concern and the full impact of their effect are largely unpredictable they can dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior by consumer and therefore demand for our service which can adversely affect our business and result of operation see part item risk factor decline or disruption in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance we intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotion technology and personnel within parameter consistent with attempt to improve long term operating result even if those expenditure create pressure on operating margin we have experienced pressure on operating margin we prioritize initiative that drive growth we also intend to broaden the scope of our business and to that end we explore strategic alternative from time to time in the form of among other thing acquisition the overall size of our business ha grown the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass wider range of service and technology including service and technology that may be outside of our historical core business and our ability to keep pace may slow potential competitor such emerging start ups may be able to innovate and focus on developing particularly new product or service faster than we can or may foresee consumer need for new service or technology before some of our larger competitor or potential competitor have more resource or more established or diversified relationship with consumer than we do and they could use these advantage in way that could affect our position including by making acquisition entering or investing in travel reservation business investing in research and development and competing aggressively for highly skilled employee our goal is to grow gross profit and achieve healthy operating margin in an effort to maintain profitability the uncertain and highly competitive environment in which we operate make the prediction of future result of operation difficult and accordingly we may not be able to sustain gross profit growth and profitability critical accounting policy and estimatesmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation is based upon our consolidated financial statement which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state gaap our significant accounting policy and estimate are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statement certain of our accounting estimate are particularly important to our financial position and result of operation and require to make difficult and subjective judgment often result of the need to make estimate of matter that are inherently uncertain our management us it judgment to determine the appropriate assumption to be used in the determination of certain estimate we evaluate our estimate on an ongoing basis estimate are based on among other thing historical experience term of existing contract our observance of trend in the travel industry and on various other assumption that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance our actual result may differ from these estimate under different assumption or condition our critical accounting policy that involve significant estimate and judgment of management include the following valuation of goodwill long lived asset and intangible the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combination requires the use of significant estimate and assumption to determine the fair value of the asset acquired and liability assumed our estimate of the fair value are based upon assumption that we believe are reasonable and when we deem appropriate include assistance from third party valuation firm the purchase price consideration is allocated to the asset acquired and liability assumed based on their respective fair value at the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price consideration over the net of the amount allocated to the asset acquired and liability assumed is recognized goodwill goodwill is assigned to reporting unit that are expected to benefit from the synergy of the business combination of the acquisition date we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable substantial portion of our intangible and goodwill relates to the acquisition of opentable in july and kayak in may of september we performed our annual quantitative goodwill impairment test other than opentable the fair value of our reporting unit substantially exceeded their respective carrying value opentablewe estimated opentable fair value using combination of standard valuation technique including an income approach discounted cash flow and market approach ebitda multiple of comparable publicly traded company and precedent transaction at september opentable fair value wa approximately higher than it fair value at september which reflects performance that exceeded forecast despite this increase in fair value opentable fair value wa approximately lower than it carrying value at september thus failing step of the goodwill impairment test therefore we received assistance from third party valuation firm to develop hypothetical purchase price allocation step the result of step indicated there wa no goodwill impairment at september because the implied fair value of opentable goodwill exceeded it carrying value by approximately we tested the recoverability of opentable other long lived asset and concluded there wa no impairment of september since the annual impairment test of september there have been no event or change in circumstance to indicate potential impairment for the year ended december we recognized non cash impairment charge for goodwill of million which wa not tax deductible if opentable doe not achieve the result currently expected or if any of the assumption underlying our estimate of the fair value of the opentable business prove to be incorrect we may refine our forecast for the opentable business and recognize an additional goodwill impairment which could have material adverse effect on our result of operation see part item risk factor the success of our acquisition of opentable is subject to numerous risk and uncertainty income tax we determine our tax expense based on our income and statutory tax rate applicable in the various jurisdiction in which we operate due to the complex nature of tax legislation and frequent change with such associated legislation significant judgment is required in computing our tax expense and determining our tax position on december the government enacted the tax act the tax act made significant change to federal tax law including reduction in the federal statutory tax rate from to effective january the tax act imposes one time deemed repatriation tax on accumulated unremitted international earnings to be paid over eight year the tax act also introduced in tax on of global intangible low taxed income gilti which is income determined to be in excess of specified routine rate of return and also introduced base erosion and anti abuse tax beat aimed at preventing the erosion of the tax base we continue to review the gilti and beat provision of the tax act for applicability to and expect further guidance from the treasury department the internal revenue service state tax authority and or other authority on the application of these provision we have not yet adopted an accounting policy to whether we will treat tax on gilti period cost or whether we will recognize deferred tax asset and liability when basis difference exist that are expected to affect the amount of gilti inclusion upon reversal the provision of tax act are broad and complex and there are significant uncertainty about how it will be interpreted at both the federal and state level and limited guidance is available from tax authority at this time further interpretation and implementation of the tax act may materially impact our provisional income tax expense and future income tax expense and obligation on december staff accounting bulletin no sab wa issued by the security and exchange commission to address the application of gaap in situation when the registrant doe not have all the necessary information available prepared or analyzed including computation in reasonable detail to complete it accounting for the change in tax law in accordance with sab to the extent registrant can reasonably estimate the effect of the tax act provisional tax amount can be recorded but must be finalized prior to december further analysis is necessary to finalize our accumulated unremitted international earnings subject to the federal deemed repatriation tax in addition since we are still evaluating whether and to what extent we will utilize our net operating loss carryforwards against the transition tax liability our deferred tax asset or liability may be impacted therefore we consider our accounting related to the tax act for federal and state income tax well international withholding tax to be provisional we refine our estimate and continue to evaluate the tax act we will adjust our provision for income tax in the period when change in estimate occurs see note to our consolidated financial statement we regularly review our deferred tax asset for recoverability considering historical profitability projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversal of temporary difference and tax planning strategy and record valuation allowance required we are subject to ongoing tax examination and assessment in various jurisdiction to date we have been audited in several taxing jurisdiction with no significant impact on our financial condition result of operation or cash flow although we believe that our tax filing position are reasonable the final determination of tax audit or tax dispute may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provision and accrual accordingly we may incur additional tax expense based upon our assessment of the more likely than not outcome or we may adjust previously recorded tax expense to reflect examination result stock based compensation we record stock based compensation expense for equity based award over the recipient service period based upon the grant date fair value of the award number of our equity award have performance target performance contingency which if satisfied can increase the number of share issued to the recipient at the end of the performance period or in certain instance if not satisfied reduce the number of share issued to the recipient sometimes to zero at the end of the performance period the performance period for our performance based equity award are typically three year we record stock based compensation expense for these performance based award based upon our estimate of the probable outcome at the end of the performance period the estimated performance against the performance target we periodically adjust the cumulative stock based compensation expense recorded when the probable outcome for these performance based award is updated based upon change in actual and operating result stock based compensation expense for the year ended december and includes charge amounting to million million and million respectively representing the impact of adjusting the estimated probable outcome of unvested performance share unit our actual performance against the performance target could differ materially from our estimate recent accounting pronouncement see note to the consolidated financial statement for detail which is incorporated into this item by reference thereto of operation year ended december compared to year ended december evaluate certain operating and financial measure on both an reported and constant currency basis we calculate constant currency by converting our current year period financial result for transaction recorded in currency other than dollar using the corresponding prior year period monthly average exchange rate rather than the current year period monthly average exchange rate operating and statistical metric our financial result are driven by certain operating metric that encompass the booking and other business activity generated by our travel and travel related service specifically reservation of accommodation room night rental car day and airline ticket capture the volume of unit booked through our otc brand by our travel reservation service customer gross booking is an operating and statistical metric that capture the total dollar value generally inclusive of tax and fee of all travel service booked through our otc brand by our customer net of cancellation and is widely used in the travel business our non otc brand kayak and opentable have different business metric from those of our otc brand and therefore search query through kayak and restaurant reservation through opentable do not contribute to our gross booking gross booking resulting from reservation of accommodation room night rental car day and airline ticket made through our agency and merchant model for the year ended december and were follows number may not total due to rounding year ended december in million changeagency total gross booking increased by for the year ended december compared to the year ended december growth on constant currency basis wa approximately almost entirely due to growth of in accommodation room night reservation accommodation adrs on constant currency basis were relatively unchanged for the year ended december compared to the year ended december for the year ended december compared to the year ended december foreign exchange rate fluctuation slightly benefited gross booking growth in dollar we believe that unit growth rate and total gross booking and gross profit growth on constant currency basis each of which exclude the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuation are important measure to understand the fundamental performance of the business agency gross booking are derived from travel related transaction where we do not facilitate payment for the travel service provided agency gross booking increased by for the year ended december compared to the year ended december almost entirely due to the growth in gross

growth room night rental car day and airline ticket reserved through our service for the year ended december and were follows year ended december in million changeroom rental car airline accommodation

result we believe that gross profit is an important measure for evaluating growth in our business gross profit percentage of gross booking wa for the year ended december compared to for the year ended

received formal assessment in december in which the french tax authority claim that booking com ha permanent establishment in france and seek to recover unpaid income tax and value added tax of approximately million euro the majority of which would represent penalty and interest we believe that booking com ha been and continues to be in compliance with french tax law and we are contesting the assessment our objection to the assessment wa denied by the french tax authority if we are unable to resolve the matter with the french tax authority we would expect to challenge the assessment in the french court in order to contest the assessment in court we may be required to pay upfront the full amount or significant part of any such assessment though such payment would not constitute an admission by that we owes the tax alternatively any resolution or settlement of the matter with the french tax authority may also require payment part of such resolution or settlement in each case any such payment would not necessarily constitute an admission by that we owe the tax french tax authority have begun similar audit of the tax year through which could result in additional assessment see part item ia risk factor we may have exposure to additional tax liability number of jurisdiction have initiated lawsuit against online travel company including related to among other thing the payment of travel transaction tax hotel occupancy tax excise tax sale tax etc in addition number of state county and municipality have initiated audit proceeding issued proposed tax assessment or started inquiry relating to the payment of travel transaction tax for additional information see note to the consolidated financial statement and part item risk factor adverse application of state and local tax law could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation in this annual report result of this litigation and other attempt by jurisdiction to levy similar tax we have established an accrual including estimated interest and penalty for the potential resolution of issue related to travel transaction tax in the amount of approximately million and million of december and respectively the accrual is based on our estimate of the probable cost of resolving these issue our legal expense for these matter are expensed incurred and are not reflected in the amount accrued the actual cost may be le or greater potentially significantly than the liability recorded an estimate for reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount accrued can not be reasonably made if we were to suffer adverse determination in the near term in more of the pending proceeding than currently anticipated given result to date because of our available cash we believe that it would not have material impact on our liquidity the following table represents our material contractual obligation and commitment of december payment due by period in thousand contractual obligation total le year to to year more than yearsoperating lease obligation lease obligation construction obligation senior note credit facility earnout acquisition transition tax liability see the section on operating lease and building construction section of note to our consolidated financial statement for more detail represents the aggregate principal amount of our senior note outstanding of december and cumulative interest to maturity of billion convertible debt doe not reflect the market value in excess of the outstanding amount because we can settle the conversion premium amount in cash or share of common stock at our option see note to our consolidated financial statement represents fee on uncommitted fund and outstanding letter of credit of december we reported other long term liability of million in the consolidated balance sheet at december of which approximately million related to deferred rent approximately million related to unrecognized tax benefit see note to our consolidated financial statement and approximately million related to our accrual for the potential resolution of issue related to travel transaction tax see note to our consolidated financial statement variety of factor could affect the timing of payment for the liability related to travel transaction tax and unrecognized tax benefit we believe that these matter will likely not be resolved in the next twelve month and accordingly we have classified the estimated liability non current in the consolidated balance sheet therefore we have excluded long term liability of million from the contractual obligation table above because we can not reasonably estimate the timing of such payment or the liability is related to deferred rent which represents the difference in rent expense recognized in the income statement and rent payment related to operating lease we believe that our existing cash balance and liquid resource will be sufficient to fund our operating activity capital expenditure and other obligation through at least the next twelve month however if during that period or thereafter we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operation or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amount and on term acceptable to we may be required to reduce our planned capital expenditure and scale back the scope of our business plan either of which could have material adverse effect on our future financial condition or result of operation if additional fund were raised through the issuance of equity security the percentage ownership of our current stockholder would be diluted we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operation in the future revenue growth or sustained profitability may not be realized and future borrowing or equity sale may not be available in amount sufficient to make anticipated capital expenditure finance our strategy or repay our indebtedness off balance sheet arrangement of december we did not have any off balance sheet arrangement that have or are reasonably likely to have current or future effect on our financial condition result of operation liquidity capital expenditure or capital resource item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we manage our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk through internally established policy and procedure and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instrument we use currency exchange derivative contract to manage short term foreign currency risk the objective of our policy is to mitigate potential income statement cash flow and fair value exposure resulting from possible future adverse fluctuation in rate we evaluate our exposure to market risk by assessing the anticipated near term and long term fluctuation in interest rate and foreign exchange rate this evaluation includes the review of leading market indicator discussion with financial analyst and investment banker regarding current and future economic condition and the review of market projection to expected future rate we utilize this information to determine our own investment strategy well to determine if the use of derivative financial instrument is appropriate to mitigate any potential future market exposure that we may face our policy doe not allow speculation in derivative instrument for profit or execution of derivative instrument contract for which there are no underlying exposure we do not use financial instrument for trading purpose and are not party to any leveraged derivative to the extent that change in interest rate and currency exchange rate affect general economic condition we would also be affected by such change we did not experience any material change in interest rate exposure during the year ended december fixed rate investment are subject to unrealized gain and loss due to interest rate volatility we performed sensitivity analysis to determine the impact change in interest rate would have on the fair value of our available for sale investment assuming an adverse change of basis point hypothetical basis point increase in interest rate would have resulted in decrease in the fair value of our investment of december of approximately million these hypothetical loss would only be realized if we sold the investment prior to their maturity this amount excludes our investment in ctrip com international ltd ctrip senior convertible note which are more sensitive to the market price volatility of ctrip american depositary share ad than change in interest rate the fair value of our ctrip senior note will most likely increase the market price of ctrip ad increase and decrease the market price of ctrip ad fall of december the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our debt wa approximately billion we estimate that the market value of such debt wa approximately billion of december substantial portion of the market value of our debt in excess of the outstanding principal amount relates to the conversion premium on our outstanding convertible note we conduct significant portion of our business outside the united state through subsidiary with functional currency other than the dollar primarily euro result we face exposure to adverse movement in currency exchange rate the operating result of our international operation are translated from local currency into dollar upon consolidation if the dollar weakens against the local currency the translation of these foreign currency denominated balance will result in increased net asset gross booking gross profit operating expense and net income similarly our net asset gross booking gross profit operating expense and net income will decrease if the dollar strengthens against the local currency additionally foreign exchange rate fluctuation on transaction denominated in currency other than the functional currency result in gain and loss that are reflected in the consolidated statement of operation result of currency exchange rate change our foreign currency denominated net asset gross booking gross profit operating expense and net income have been positively impacted expressed in dollar for the year ended december compared to the year ended december since our expense are generally denominated in foreign currency on basis similar to our revenue our operating margin have not been significantly impacted by currency fluctuation the aggregate principal value of our euro denominated long term debt and accrued interest thereon provide natural hedge against the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuation on the net asset of certain of our euro functional currency subsidiary from time to time we enter into foreign currency derivative contract to minimize the impact of short term foreign currency fluctuation on our consolidated operating result our derivative contract principally address foreign currency fluctuation risk for the euro british pound sterling and certain other currency versus the dollar of december and there were no such outstanding derivative contract foreign currency loss of million for the year ended
