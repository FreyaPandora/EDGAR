the effective minimum ratio the capital conservation buffer is taken into account will be subject to constraint on capital distribution including dividend and share repurchase and certain discretionary executive compensation with the severity of the constraint depending on the extent of the shortfall with progressively more stringent constraint on capital action the company approach the minimum ratio on april the federal reserve issued proposal that would create single integrated capital requirement by combining the capital conservation buffer requirement with the quantitative

subject to the minimum slr requirement on january at december the company exceeded the applicable minimum slr requirement in december the basel committee finalized package of revision to the basel iii framework the change are meant to improve the calculation of risk weighted asset and improve the comparability of capital ratio by enhancing the robustness and risk sensitivity of the standardized approach for credit risk credit valuation adjustment cva risk and operational risk constraining the use of the internal model approach by placing limit on certain input used to calculate capital requirement under the internal rating based irb approach for credit risk and by removing the use of the internal model approach for cva risk and for operational risk introducing leverage ratio buffer to further limit the leverage of global systemically important bank sib and replacing the existing basel ii output floor with more robust risk sensitive floor based on the committee revised basel iii standardized approach january is the implementation date for the revised standardized approach for credit risk and leverage ratio well the irb cva operational risk and market risk framework the output floor will be subject to transitional period beginning in january with full implementation by january federal banking regulator are expected to undertake rulemakings in future year to implement these revision in the united state under the proposed tailoring rule the company category iii banking organization would no longer be required to calculate risk based capital ratio under the advanced approach for purpose of determining regulatory compliance instead the company risk based capital ratio would be calculated using only the standardized approach the company would remain subject to the slr and the countercyclical capital buffer in addition the company category iii banking organization would be permitted to opt of recognizing accumulated other comprehensive income aoci in common equity tier capital for purpose of calculating it regulatory capital ratio the company can not predict whether the final form of the proposed tailoring rule will exempt the company from using the advanced approach to calculate risk based capital ratio or permit the company to opt out of including aoci in it calculation of common equity tier capital in addition in december the united state federal banking agency finalized rule that provide banking organization the option to phase in over three year period the day one adverse effect on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption

capital planning and stress testing requirement with certain ongoing regulatory capital requirement the proposal which would apply to certain bank holding company including the company would introduce stress capital buffer and stress leverage buffer or stress buffer requirement and related change to the capital planning and stress testing process for risk based capital requirement the stress capital buffer would replace the existing capital conservation buffer which is percent of january the stress capital buffer would equal the greater of the maximum decline in the company common equity tier capital ratio under the severely adverse scenario over the supervisory stress test measurement period plus the sum of the ratio of the dollar amount of it planned common stock dividend to it projected risk weighted asset for each of the fourth through seventh quarter of the supervisory stress test projection period and ii percent the proposal would make related change to capital planning
