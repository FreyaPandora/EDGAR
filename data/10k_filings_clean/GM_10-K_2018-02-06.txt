patent are important to our operation and continued technological development we hold number of trademark and service mark that are important to our identity and recognition in the marketplace raw material service and supply we purchase wide variety of raw material part supply energy freight transportation and other service from numerous supplier to manufacture our product the raw material primarily include steel aluminum resin copper lead and platinum group metal we have not experienced any significant shortage of raw material and normally do not carry substantial inventory of such raw material in excess of level reasonably required to meet our production requirement in some instance we purchase system component part and supply from single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruption the inability or unwillingness of these source to supply with part and supply could have material adverse effect on our production capacity refer to item risk factor for discussion of these risk combined purchase from our two largest supplier have been approximately of our total purchase in each of the year ended december and environmental and regulatory mattersautomotive emission control we are subject to law and regulation that require to control automotive emission including vehicle exhaust emission standard vehicle evaporative emission standard and onboard diagnostic obd system requirement advanced obd system are used to identify and diagnose problem with emission control system problem detected by the obd system and other in use compliance monitoring activity may increase warranty cost and the likelihood of recall emission and obd requirement have become more stringent result of lower emission standard and new diagnostic requirement which have come into force in many market around the world driven by policy priority such air quality energy security and climate change often with very little harmonization of the regulation while we believe all of our product are designed and manufactured of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesin material compliance with substantially all vehicle emission requirement regulatory authority may conduct ongoing evaluation of the emission compliance of product from all manufacturer this includes vehicle emission testing including and nitrogen oxide emission testing and review of emission control design and strategy the federal government imposes stringent emission control requirement on vehicle sold in the and various state government impose additional emission requirement established by california canada federal government vehicle emission requirement are generally aligned with the federal requirement each model year we must obtain certification for each test group that our vehicle will meet emission requirement from the environmental protection agency epa we can sell vehicle in the and canada and from the california air resource board carb before we can sell vehicle in california and other state that have adopted the california emission requirement carb latest emission requirement include more stringent exhaust emission and evaporative emission standard including an increase in zevs which must be offered for sale in california carb ha adopted model year and later requirement for increasing volume of zevs to achieve ghg well criterion pollutant emission reduction to help achieve the state long term ghg reduction goal the canadian province of quebec also plan to adopt zev requirement starting with the model year largely based on california program requirement is possibility that additional jurisdiction could adopt zev requirement in the future the epa ha adopted similar exhaust emission and evaporative emission standard which began multi year phase in with the model year do not include zev requirement these new requirement will also increase the time and mileage period over which manufacturer are responsible for vehicle emission performance the clean air act permit state that have area with air quality compliance issue to adopt the california emission standard in lieu of the federal requirement thirteen state currently have these standard in effect and of these state have adopted the zev requirement china implemented the china emission standard nationwide at the beginning of china is more stringent than the previous program on all level including overall emission requirement and the time and mileage period for which vehicle need to meet china level performance china will implement unique china emission standard that combine element of both european and standard includes more stringent emission requirement and increase the time and mileage period over which manufacturer are responsible for vehicle emission performance nationwide implementation for new registration is expected in july for china and july for the more stringent china standard however locality can pull ahead china requirement if certain criterion are met some city may implement china early january in south america certain country follow the test procedure standard and obd requirement and others follow the european union test procedure standard and obd requirement with different level of stringency brazil implemented national standard for light diesel vehicle in and obd installation for light diesel vehicle in standard for light gasoline vehicle were implemented in for all model result of the sale of the opel vauxhall business gm vehicle presence in europe will be smaller but gm may be affected by action taken by regulator related to product sold before the sale of the opel vauxhall business and future product sold by gm in europe for example in germany number of automotive manufacturer including our former german subsidiary have participated in continuing discussion with german and european union authority concerning emission control system in the european union increased scrutiny of compliance with emission standard may result in change to these standard including implementation of real world driving emission rde test well stricter interpretation or redefinition of these standard and more rigorous enforcement this may lead to increased cost penalty and lack of certainty related to product portfolio planning negative publicity or reputation impact for in the long term we expect that the european commission will continue devising regulatory requirement on the emission test cycle rde low temperature testing fuel evaporation and obd automotive fuel economy in the nhtsa promulgates and enforces corporate average fuel economy cafe standard for three separate fleet domestically produced car imported car and light duty truck manufacturer are subject to substantial civil penalty if they fail to meet the applicable cafe standard in any model year after taking into account all available credit for the preceding five model year and expected credit for the three succeeding model year in addition to federal cafe reporting the epa promulgates and enforces ghg emission standard which are effectively fuel economy standard the majority of vehicle ghg emission are the result of fuel combustion in addition carb ha asserted the right to promulgate and enforce it own state ghg standard for motor vehicle and other state have asserted the right to adopt the california standard however carb ha agreed that compliance with the federal epa light duty ghg program is deemed to be in compliance with the california standard through the model year of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiarieschina ha two fuel economy requirement for passenger vehicle an individual vehicle pas fail type approval requirement and fleet average fuel consumption requirement the current china phase fleet fuel consumption requirement is effective from china phase is based on curb weight with full compliance to km required by china phase ha continued subsidy for plug in hybrid battery electric and fuel cell vehicle china phase is currently being developed with planned start in with full compliance to required by china recently announced the detail of the new energy vehicle mandate this will require passenger car manufacturer to produce certain volume of plug in hybrid battery electric and fuel cell vehicle to generate credit equivalent to in and in the number of credit per car is based on the level of range and energy efficiency regulator in other jurisdiction have already adopted or are developing fuel economy or carbon dioxide regulation if regulator in these jurisdiction seek to impose and enforce emission standard that are misaligned with market condition we may be forced to take various action to increase market support program for more fuel efficient vehicle and curtail production of certain high performance car truck and sport utility vehicle suv in order to achieve compliance we regularly evaluate our current and future product plan and strategy for compliance with fuel economy and ghg regulation industrial environmental control our operation are subject to wide range of environmental protection law including those regulating air emission water discharge waste management and environmental cleanup certain environmental statute require that responsible party fund remediation action regardless of fault legality of original disposal or ownership of disposal site under certain circumstance these law impose joint and several liability well liability for related damage to natural resource to mitigate the effect of our worldwide operation on the environment we are converting many of our worldwide operation possible to landfill free operation which reduces ghg emission associated with waste disposal at december or approximately of our manufacturing operation were landfill free additionally of our non manufacturing operation are landfill free at our landfill free manufacturing operation approximately of waste material are composted reused or recycled and approximately are converted to energy at waste to energy facility in we estimate that our waste reduction program diverted million metric ton of waste from landfill resulting in approximately million metric ton of ghg emission avoided in global manufacturing operation including construction demolition and remediation waste in addition to minimizing our impact on the environment our landfill free program and total waste reduction commitment generate revenue from the sale of production by product reduce our use of material reduce our carbon footprint and help to reduce the risk and financial liability associated with waste disposal we continue to search for way to increase our use of renewable energy and improve our energy efficiency and work to drive growth and scale of renewables we have committed to meeting the electricity need of our operation worldwide with renewable energy by at december we had implemented project or signed renewable energy contract globally that had increased our total renewable energy capacity to over megawatt in gm executed two megawatt wind power purchase agreement to match our ohio and indiana manufacturing plant load each of these project come online in we continue to seek opportunity for diversified renewable energy portfolio including wind solar and landfill gas in energy star certified three of our assembly plant and building for superior energy management we also met the epa energy star challenge for industry epa challenge at eight additional site globally by reducing energy intensity an average of at these site to meet the epa challenge industrial site must reduce energy intensity by within five year period in total gm owned site have met the epa challenge with many site achieving the goal multiple time these effort minimize our utility expense and are part of our approach to addressing climate change through setting ghg emission reduction target collecting accurate data following our business plan

supplier and the automotive industry globally governmental agency continue to introduce new legislation and regulation related to the selection and use of chemical by mandating broad prohibition or restriction and implementing green chemistry life cycle analysis and product stewardship initiative these initiative give broad regulatory authority to ban or restrict the use of certain chemical substance and potentially affect automobile manufacturer responsibility for vehicle component at the end of vehicle life well chemical selection for product development and manufacturing global treaty and initiative such the stockholm basel and rotterdam convention on chemical and waste and the minamata convention on mercury are driving chemical regulation across signatory country in addition more global jurisdiction are establishing substance standard with regard to vehicle interior air quality of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiarieschemical regulation are increasing in north america in june the enacted the chemical safety for the century act that grant the epa increased authority to regulate and restrict chemical use in the and is expected to increase the level of regulation of chemical in vehicle chemical restriction in canada continue to progress rapidly result of environment canada chemical management plan to ass existing substance and implement risk management control on any chemical deemed toxic china prohibits the use of several chemical substance in vehicle there are also various regulation in china stipulating the requirement for chemical management among other thing these regulation catalogue and restrict the use and the import and export of various chemical substance the failure of our joint venture partner or our supplier to comply with these regulation could disrupt production in china or prevent our joint venture partner from selling the affected product in the china market these emerging regulation will potentially lead to increase in cost and supply chain complexity we believe that we are materially in compliance with substantially all of these requirement or expect to be materially in compliance by the required date safety in the the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act of prohibits the sale of any new vehicle or equipment in the that doe not conform to applicable vehicle safety standard established by the nhtsa if we or

historic business model of the industry through the introduction of new technology new product or service new business model or new method of travel it is strategically significant that we lead the technological disruption occurring in our industry to successfully execute our long term strategy we must continue to develop new product and service including product and service that are outside of our historically core business such autonomous and electric vehicle data monetization and transportation service the process of designing and developing new technology product and service is complex costly and uncertain and requires extensive capital investment and the ability to retain and recruit talent in some case the technology that we plan to employ are not yet commercially practical and depend on significant future technological advance by and by our supplier there can be no assurance that advance in technology will occur in timely or feasible way or that others will not acquire similar or superior technology sooner than we do or that we will acquire technology on an exclusive basis or at significant price advantage if we do not accurately predict prepare for and respond to

consumer acceptance of new vehicle design including competitor product introduction technological innovation fuel price general economic condition and change in quality safety reliability and styling demand and preference an initial product concept or design may not result in vehicle that generates sale in sufficient quantity and at high enough price to be profitable our high proportion of fixed cost both due to our significant investment in property plant and equipment well other requirement of our collective bargaining agreement which limit our flexibility to adjust personnel cost to change in demand for our product may further exacerbate the risk associated with incorrectly assessing demand for our vehicle our profitability is dependent upon the success of crossover suv and full size pick truck while we offer balanced and complete portfolio of small mid size and large car crossover suv and truck we generally recognize higher profit margin on our crossover suv and truck our success is dependent upon our ability to sell higher margin vehicle in sufficient volume any shift in consumer preference toward smaller more fuel efficient vehicle whether result of increase in the price of oil or any sustained shortage of oil including result of global political instability or other reason could weaken the demand for our higher margin vehicle we must successfully address and reduce the

which may negatively affect our ability to sell electric vehicle in sufficient quantity and at high enough price to be profitable our business is highly dependent upon global automobile market sale volume which can be volatile because we have high proportion of relatively fixed structural cost small change in sale volume can have disproportionately large effect on our profitability number of economic and market condition drive change in vehicle sale including real estate value level of unemployment availability of affordable financing fluctuation in the cost of fuel consumer confidence political unrest and global economic condition for discussion of economic and market trend see the overview section of item we can not predict future economic and market condition with certainty our significant business in china subject to unique operational competitive and regulatory risk maintaining strong position in the chinese market is key component of our global growth strategy our business in china is subject to aggressive competition from many of the largest global manufacturer and numerous domestic manufacturer the size of the chinese market continues to increase we anticipate that additional competitor both international and domestic will seek to enter the chinese market and that existing market participant will act aggressively to increase their market share increased competition may result in price reduction reduced margin and challenge to gain or hold market share in addition to increased competition chinese regulator have announced aggressive policy initiative and quota for the sale of electric vehicle certain risk and uncertainty of business in china are solely within the control of the chinese government and chinese law regulates the scope of our foreign investment and business conducted within china in order to maintain access to the chinese market we may be required to comply with significant technical and other regulatory requirement that are unique to the chinese market at time with challenging lead time to implement such requirement these action may increase the cost of doing business in china and reduce our profitability significant amount of our operation are conducted by joint venture that we can not operate solely for our benefit many of our operation primarily in china are carried by joint venture in joint venture we share ownership and management of company with one or more party who may not have the same goal strategy priority or resource we do and may compete with outside the joint venture joint venture are intended to be operated for the equal benefit of all co owner rather than for our exclusive benefit operating business joint venture often requires additional organizational formality well time consuming procedure for sharing information and making decision that must further take into consideration our partner interest in joint venture we are required to foster our relationship with our co owner well promote the overall success of the joint venture and if co owner change relationship deteriorate or strategic objective diverge our success in the joint venture may be materially adversely affected the benefit from successful joint venture are shared among the co owner therefore we do not receive all the benefit from our successful joint venture in addition because we share ownership and management with one or more party we may have limited control over the action of joint venture particularly when we own minority interest result we may be unable to prevent misconduct or other violation of applicable law by joint venture moreover joint venture may not follow the same requirement regarding compliance internal control and internal control over financial reporting that we follow to the extent another party make decision that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control issue arise within the joint venture we may have to take responsive or other action or we may be subject to penalty fine or other related action for these activity the international scale and footprint of our operation expose to additional risk we manufacture sell and service product globally and rely upon global supply chain to deliver the raw material component system and part that we need to manufacture our product our global operation subject to extensive domestic and foreign legal and regulatory requirement and variety of other political economic and regulatory risk including change in government leadership change in law or regulation impacting our overall business model or restricting our ability to manufacture purchase or sell product and political pressure to change any aspect of our business model or practice and source raw material component system and part on competitive term in manner consistent with our current practice change in tax law economic tension between government and change in international trade policy including restriction on the repatriation of dividend especially between the and china more detailed inspection new or higher tariff for example on product imported from mexico into the new barrier to entry or domestic preference procurement requirement change to or withdrawal from free trade agreement for example the north american free trade agreement or nafta or preference of foreign national for domestically manufactured product change in foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate economic downturn in foreign country or geographic region where we have significant operation significant change in condition in the country in which we operate with the effect of of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariescompetition from new market entrant differing local product preference and product requirement including fuel economy vehicle emission and safety impact of compliance with and other foreign country export control and economic sanction liability resulting from and foreign law and regulation including those related to the foreign corrupt practice act and certain other anti corruption law differing labor regulation and union relationship and difficulty in obtaining financing in foreign country for local operation any significant disruption at one of our manufacturing facility could disrupt our production schedule we assemble vehicle at various facility around the world these facility are typically designed to produce particular model for particular geographic market no single facility is designed to manufacture our full range of vehicle in some case certain facility produce product system component and part that disproportionately contribute greater degree to our profitability than others these or other facility become unavailable either temporarily or permanently for any number of reason including labor disruption the inability to manufacture there may result in harm to our reputation increased cost lower revenue and the loss of customer we may not be able to easily shift production to other facility or to make up for lost production any new facility needed to replace an inoperable manufacturing facility would need to comply with the necessary regulatory requirement need to satisfy our specialized manufacturing requirement and require specialized equipment even though we carry business interruption insurance policy we may suffer loss result of business interruption that exceed the coverage available or any loss which may be excluded under our insurance policy any disruption in our supplier operation could disrupt our production schedule our automotive operation are dependent upon the continued ability of our supplier to deliver the system component raw material and part that we need to manufacture our product our use of in time manufacturing process allows to maintain minimal inventory quantity of system component raw material and part result our ability to maintain production is dependent upon our supplier delivering sufficient quantity of system component raw material and part on time to meet our production schedule in some instance we purchase system component raw material and part that ultimately derive from single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruption dispute financial difficulty or solvency problem with our supplier including takata corporation takata which may be exacerbated by the cost of remediating quality issue with these item could lead to uncertainty in our supply chain or cause supply disruption for which could in turn disrupt our operation including production of certain of our higher margin vehicle where we experience supply disruption we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of system component raw material or part even for relatively short period of time could cause to alter production schedule or suspend production entirely high price of raw material used by and our supplier could negatively impact our profitability increase in price for raw material that we and our supplier use in manufacturing product system component and part such steel precious metal non ferrous metal including aluminum copper and plastic part may lead to higher production cost for part and component this could in turn negatively impact our future profitability because we may not be able to pas all of those cost on to our customer or require our supplier to absorb such cost we operate in highly competitive industry that ha excess manufacturing capacity and attempt by our competitor to sell more vehicle could have significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing market share and operating result the global automotive industry is highly competitive and overall manufacturing capacity in the industry far exceeds demand many manufacturer have relatively high fixed labor cost well significant limitation on their ability to close facility and reduce fixed cost many of our competitor have responded to these relatively high fixed cost by providing subsidized financing or leasing program offering marketing incentive or reducing vehicle price result we are not necessarily able to set our price to offset higher cost of marketing incentive commodity or other cost increase or the impact of adverse currency fluctuation our competitor may also seek to benefit from economy of scale by consolidating or entering into other strategic agreement such alliance intended to enhance their competitiveness domestic manufacturer in lower cost country such china and india have become competitor in key emerging market and announced their intention to export their product to established market low cost alternative to established entry level automobile in addition foreign government may decide to implement tax and other policy that favor their domestic manufacturer at the expense of international manufacturer including gm and it joint venture partner these action have had and are expected to continue to have significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing market share and operating result competitor may independently develop product and service similar to and there are no guarantee that gm intellectual property right would prevent competitor from independently developing or selling those product and service there may be instance where notwithstanding our intellectual property position competitive product or service may impact the value of our brand and other intangible asset and our business may be adversely affected moreover although gm take of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesreasonable step to maintain the confidentiality of gm proprietary information there can be no assurance that such effort will completely deter misappropriation or improper use of our technology we sometimes face attempt to gain unauthorized access to our information technology network and system for the purpose of improperly acquiring our trade secret or confidential business information the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secret and other confidential business information result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position in addition we may be the target of enforcement of patent by third party including aggressive and opportunistic enforcement claim by non practicing entity regardless of the merit of such claim responding to infringement claim can be expensive and time consuming although we have taken step to mitigate such risk if we are found to infringe any third party right we could be required to pay substantial damage or we could be enjoined from offering some of our product and service security breach and other disruption to information technology system and networked product including connected vehicle owned or maintained by gm financial or third party vendor or supplier on our behalf could interfere with our operation and could compromise the confidentiality of private customer data or our proprietary information we rely upon information technology system and manufacture networked product some of which are managed by third party to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support variety of our business process activity and product additionally we and gm financial collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information proprietary business information of our dealer and supplier well personally identifiable information of our customer and employee in data center and on information technology network the secure operation of these system and product and the processing and maintenance of the information processed by these system and product is critical to our business operation and strategy despite security measure and business continuity plan these system and product may be vulnerable to damage disruption or shutdown caused by attack by hacker computer virus or breach due to error or malfeasance by employee contractor and others who have access to these system and product the occurrence of any of these event could compromise the operational integrity of these system and product similarly such an occurrence could result in the compromise or loss of the information processed by these system and product such event could result in among other thing the loss of proprietary data interruption or delay in our business operation and damage to our reputation in addition such event could result in legal claim or proceeding liability or regulatory penalty under law protecting the privacy of personal information disrupt operation or reduce the competitive advantage we hope to derive from our investment in advanced technology we have experienced such event in the past and although past event were immaterial future event may occur and may be material portion of our information technology system also may experience interruption delay or cessation of service or produce error due to regular maintenance effort such system integration or migration work that take place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new system and transitioning data which could cause business disruption and be more expensive time consuming disruptive and resource intensive such disruption could adversely impact our ability to design manufacture and sell product and service and interrupt other business process security breach and other disruption of our in vehicle system could impact the safety of our customer and reduce confidence in gm and our product our vehicle contain complex information technology system these system control various vehicle function including engine transmission safety steering navigation acceleration braking window and door lock function we have designed implemented and tested security measure intended to prevent unauthorized access to these system however hacker have reportedly attempted and may attempt in the future to gain unauthorized access to modify alter and use such system to gain control of or to change our vehicle functionality user interface and performance characteristic or to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle any unauthorized access to or control of our vehicle or their system or any loss of data could impact the safety of our customer or result in legal claim or proceeding liability or regulatory penalty in addition regardless of their veracity report of unauthorized access to our vehicle their system or data could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospect financial condition and operating result our product are subject to extensive law governmental regulation and policy that can significantly increase our cost and affect we do business we are significantly affected by governmental regulation that can increase cost related to the production of our vehicle and affect our product portfolio meeting or exceeding many of these regulation is costly and often technologically challenging with respect to mandated emission and fuel economy standard especially where standard may not be harmonized across jurisdiction we anticipate that the number and extent of these regulation and the related cost and change to our product portfolio may increase significantly in the future these government regulatory requirement could significantly affect our plan for global product development and given the uncertainty surrounding enforcement and regulatory definition may result in substantial cost including civil or criminal penalty in addition an evolving but un harmonized regulatory framework may limit or dictate the type of vehicle we sell and where we sell which can affect revenue refer to the environmental and regulatory matter section of item business for further information on these regulatory requirement we also expect that manufacturer will continue to be subject to increased scrutiny from regulator globally of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiarieswe expect that to comply with fuel economy and emission control requirement we will be required to sell significant volume of electric vehicle well develop and implement new technology for conventional internal combustion engine all at increased cost level there are limit on our ability to achieve fuel economy improvement over given time frame however there is no assurance that we will be able to produce and sell vehicle that use such new technology on profitable basis or that our customer will purchase such vehicle in the quantity necessary for to comply with these regulatory program in the current uncertain regulatory framework environmental liability for which we may be responsible and that are not reasonably estimable could be substantial alleged violation of safety or emission standard could result in legal proceeding the recall of one or more of our product negotiated remedial action fine restricted product offering or combination of any of those item any of these action could have substantial adverse effect on our operation including facility idling reduced employment increased cost and loss of revenue many of our advanced technology including autonomous present novel issue with which domestic and foreign regulator have only limited experience and will be subject to evolving regulatory framework any current or future regulation in these area could impact whether and how these technology are designed and integrated into our product and may ultimately subject to increased cost and uncertainty we could be materially adversely affected by unusual or significant litigation governmental investigation or other proceeding we are subject to legal proceeding involving various issue including product liability lawsuit stockholder litigation and proceeding related to the ignition switch recall in addition we are subject to governmental proceeding and investigation negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceeding could result in the imposition of damage including punitive damage substantial fine significant reputational harm civil lawsuit and criminal penalty interruption of business modification of business practice equitable remedy and other sanction against or our personnel well significant legal and other cost in addition we may become obligated to issue up to million share of our common stock subject to adjustment to take into account stock dividend stock split and other transaction to the motor liquidation company guc trust guc trust under provision of the amended and restated master sale and purchase agreement between and general motor corporation and certain of it subsidiary in the event that allowed general unsecured claim against the guc trust estimated by the united state bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york bankruptcy court exceed billion at december the bankruptcy court estimated that allowed general unsecured claim were approximately billion if in the discretion of the attorney office for the southern district of new york the attorney office we do not comply with the term of the deferred prosecution agreement the dpa the attorney office may prosecute for charge alleged by the attorney office including those relating to faulty ignition switch on september we announced that we entered into the dpa with the attorney office regarding it investigation of the event leading up to certain recall announced in february and march of relating to faulty ignition switch under the dpa we consented to among other thing the filing of two count information the information in the district court for the southern district of new york the southern district charging gm with scheme to conceal material fact from government regulator and wire fraud we pled not guilty to the charge alleged in the information the dpa further provides that in the event the attorney office determines during the period of deferral of prosecution or any extension thereof that we have violated any provision of the dpa including violating any federal law or our obligation to cooperate with and assist the independent monitor the monitor the attorney office may in it discretion either prosecute on the charge alleged in the information or impose an extension of the period of deferral of prosecution of up to one additional year under such circumstance the attorney office would be permitted to rely upon the admission we made in the dpa and would benefit from our waiver of certain procedural and evidentiary defense such criminal prosecution could subject to penalty the cost and effect on our reputation of product safety recall and alleged defect in product and service could materially adversely affect our business government safety standard require manufacturer to remedy certain product safety defect through recall campaign under these standard we could be subject to civil or criminal penalty or may incur various cost including significant cost for free repair at present the cost we incur in connection with these recall typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part the cost to complete recall or customer satisfaction action could be exacerbated to the extent that such action relates to global platform concern about the safety of our product including advanced technology like autonomous whether raised internally or by regulator or consumer advocate and whether or not based on scientific evidence can result in product delay recall lost sale governmental investigation regulatory action private claim lawsuit and settlement and reputational damage these circumstance can also result in damage to brand image brand equity and consumer trust in the company product and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiarieswe currently source variety of system component raw material and part including but not limited to air bag inflator from third party from time to time these item may have performance quality or reputational issue that could harm our reputation and cause to incur significant cost for example we are currently conducting recall for certain takata air bag inflator used in some of our prior model year vehicle further recall if any that may be required to remediate takata air bag inflator in our vehicle could have material impact on our business for further discussion of these matter refer to note to our consolidated financial statement we may continue to restructure or divest our operation in various country but we may not succeed in doing in we announced significant restructuring and cost reduction action to lower our operating cost in response to difficult market and operating condition in various part of the world we continue to ass our performance throughout our region we may take additional restructuring action to rationalize our operation which may result in impairment and reduce our profitability in the period incurred in addition we may not realize anticipated saving or benefit from past or future cost reduction action in full or in part or within the time period we expect we are also subject to the risk of labor unrest negative publicity and business disruption in connection with our cost reduction action failure to realize anticipated saving or benefit from our cost reduction action could have material adverse effect on our business prospect financial condition liquidity result of operation and cash flow our future competitiveness and ability to achieve long term profitability depends on our ability to control our cost which requires to successfully implement operating effectiveness initiative throughout our operation we are continuing to implement number of operating effectiveness initiative to improve productivity and reduce cost our future competitiveness depends upon our continued success in implementing these initiative throughout our operation while some of the element of cost reduction are within our control others such interest rate or return on investment which influence our expense for pension depend more on external factor and there can be no assurance that such external factor will not materially adversely affect our ability to reduce our cost reducing cost may prove difficult due to our focus on increasing advertising and our belief that engineering and other expense necessary to improve the performance safety and customer satisfaction of our vehicle and to continue to innovate our technology product and service offering to meet changing customer need and market development are likely to increase we rely on gm financial to provide financial service to our dealer and customer in majority of the market in which we sell vehicle gm financial face number of business economic and financial risk that could impair it access to capital and negatively affect it business and operation and it ability to provide leasing and financing to retail consumer and commercial lending to our dealer to support additional sale of our vehicle we rely on gm financial in north america south america and china to support leasing and sale of our vehicle to consumer requiring vehicle financing and also to provide commercial lending to our dealer any reduction in gm financial ability to provide such financial service would negatively affect our effort to support additional sale of our vehicle and expand our market penetration among consumer and dealer an entity operating in the financial service sector gm financial is required to comply with wide variety of law and regulation that may be costly to adhere to and may affect our consolidated operating result compliance with these law and regulation requires that gm financial maintain form process procedure control and the infrastructure to support these requirement and these law and regulation often create operational constraint both on gm financial ability to implement servicing procedure and on pricing law in the financial service industry are designed primarily for the protection of consumer the failure to comply with these law could result in significant statutory civil and criminal penalty monetary damage attorney fee and cost possible revocation of license and damage to reputation brand and valued customer relationship the primary factor that could adversely affect gm financial business and operation and reduce it ability to provide financing service at competitive rate include the availability of borrowing under it credit facility to fund it retail and commercial finance activity it ability to access variety of financing source including the asset backed security market and other secured and unsecured debt market the performance of loan and lease in it portfolio which could be materially affected by delinquency default or prepayment wholesale auction value of used vehicle higher than expected vehicle return rate and the residual value performance on vehicle gm financial lease to customer fluctuation in interest rate and currency and change to regulation supervision and licensing across various jurisdiction including new regulation or sanction imposed in the by the department of justice sec and

an amended consent order requiring takata to file defect information report dirs for previously unrecalled front airbag inflator that contain phased stabilized ammonium nitrate based propellant without moisture absorbing desiccant on multi year risk based schedule through impacting ten of million of vehicle produced by numerous automotive manufacturer nhtsa concluded that the likely root cause of the rupturing of the airbag inflator is function of time temperature cycling and environmental moisture although we do not believe there is safety defect at this time in any unrecalled gm vehicle within scope of the takata dirs in cooperation with nhtsa we filed preliminary dirs on may updated of june covering million of certain of our vehicle which are full size pick up truck and suv on november we filed petition for inconsequentiality and request for deferral of determination regarding those vehicle on november nhtsa granted gm deferral request in connection with this petition the deferral provides gm until august to present evidence and analysis that our vehicle do not pose an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety we filed second set of preliminary dirs for certain vehicle on january these january dirs are consistent with gm may dirs on the same day we also filed second petition for inconsequentiality and deferral of decision with respect to the vehicle subject to our january dirs on january nhtsa consolidated our first and second petition for inconsequentiality and will rule on both at the same time of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiarieson august we filed supplemental brief in support of our petition that provided nhtsa with the result of our long term study and testing and the basis for our determination that the inflator in these vehicle do not present an unreasonable risk to safety and that no repair should ultimately be required in our brief we requested that nhtsa grant our petition or in the alternative grant an additional deferral period to provide time for further testing we filed third set of preliminary dirs for certain vehicle on january these january dirs are consistent with gm may dirs and january dirs on the same day we also filed third petition for inconsequentiality with respect to the vehicle subject to our january dirs we believe these vehicle are currently performing designed and ongoing testing continues to support the belief that the vehicle unique design and integration mitigates against inflator propellant degradation and rupture risk for example the airbag inflator used in the vehicle are variant engineered specifically for our vehicle and include feature such greater venting unique propellant wafer configuration and machined steel end cap the inflator are packaged in the instrument panel in such way to minimize exposure to moisture from the climate control system also these vehicle have feature that minimize the maximum temperature to which the inflator will be exposed such larger interior volume and standard solar absorbing windshield and side glass accordingly no warranty provision ha been made for any repair associated with our vehicle subject to the preliminary dirs and amended consent order however in the event we are ultimately obligated to repair the vehicle subject to current or future takata dirs under the amended consent order in the we estimate reasonably possible impact to gm of approximately billion gm is engaged in discussion with regulator outside the with respect to takata inflator there are difference in vehicle and inflator design between the relevant vehicle sold internationally and those sold in the we continue to gather and analyze evidence about these inflator and to share our finding with regulator we were required to recall certain vehicle sold outside of the in the three month ended september to replace takata inflator in these vehicle additional recall if any could be material to our result of operation and cash flow we

american union contract agreement worker compensation and extended disability benefit amount do not include pension funding obligation which are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statement the table above doe not reflect product warranty and related liability certified pre owned extended warranty and free maintenance of billion and unrecognized tax benefit of billion due to the uncertainty regarding the future cash outflow potentially associated with these amount critical accounting estimate accounting estimate are an integral part of the consolidated financial statement these estimate require the use of judgment and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset and liability the disclosure of contingent asset and liability at the date of the financial statement and the reported amount of revenue and expense in the period presented we believe the accounting estimate employed are appropriate and the resulting balance are reasonable however due to the inherent uncertainty in developing estimate actual result could differ from the original estimate requiring adjustment to these balance in future period refer to note to our consolidated financial statement for our significant accounting policy related to our critical accounting estimate pension and opeb plan our defined benefit pension plan are accounted for on an actuarial basis which requires the selection of various assumption including an expected long term rate of return on plan asset discount rate mortality rate of participant and expectation of mortality improvement the expected long term rate of return on plan asset that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic study which include review of asset allocation strategy anticipated future long term performance of individual asset class risk using standard deviation and correlation of return among the asset class that comprise the plan asset mix while the study give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical return the assumption are primarily long term prospective rate of return of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesin december an investment policy study wa completed for the pension plan result of change to our capital market assumption primarily those related to the fixed income asset class the weighted average long term rate of return on asset increased from at december to at december the assumption change related to the fixed income asset class is expected to increase the return on asset by billion in the expected long term rate of return on plan asset used in determining pension expense for non plan is determined in similar manner to the plan another key assumption in determining net pension and opeb expense is the assumed discount rate used to discount plan obligation we estimate the assumed discount rate for plan using cash flow matching approach which us projected cash flow matched to spot rate along high quality corporate bond yield curve to determine the weighted average discount rate for the calculation of the present value of cash flow we apply the individual annual yield curve rate instead of the assumed discount rate to determine the service cost and interest cost which more specifically link the cash flow related to service cost and interest cost to bond maturing in their year of payment we have reviewed the mortality improvement table published by the society of actuary in the three month ended december and determined that our current assumption are appropriate to measure our december pension plan obligation significant difference in actual experience or significant change in assumption may materially affect the pension obligation the effect of actual result differing from assumption and the changing of assumption are included in unamortized net actuarial gain and loss that are subject to amortization to pension expense over future period the unamortized pre tax actuarial loss on our pension plan wa billion and billion at december and the year over year change is primarily due to the decrease in discount rate partially offset by assumption change and the increase in actual return on asset at december billion of the unamortized pre tax actuarial loss is outside the corridor of the projected benefit obligation pbo and subject to amortization the weighted average amortization period is approximately fifteen year resulting in amortization expense of billion in the underfunded status of the pension plan decreased by billion in the year ended december to billion due primarily to favorable effect of actual return on plan asset of billion other favorable change including contribution demographic gain and assumption change of billion partially offset by an unfavorable effect due to decrease in the discount rate of billion and service and interest cost of billion the following table illustrates the sensitivity to change in certain assumption for the pension plan holding all other assumption

assumption the change in benefit obligation and related plan asset pension funding requirement and future net benefit payment refer to note to our consolidated financial statement for discussion of the input used to determine fair value for each significant asset class or category valuation of deferred tax asset the ability to realize deferred tax asset depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward period provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction the assessment regarding whether valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted is based on an evaluation of possible source of taxable income and also considers all available positive and negative evidence factor our accounting for the valuation of deferred tax asset represents our best estimate of future event change in our current estimate due to unanticipated market condition governmental legislative action or event could have material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax asset of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesat december total deferred tax asset were billion and valuation allowance against those deferred tax asset were billion refer to note to our consolidated financial statement for additional information on the composition of these valuation allowance and for information on the impact of tax reform legislation valuation of gm financial equipment on operating lease asset and residual gm financial ha investment in leased vehicle recorded operating lease which relate to vehicle lease to retail customer with lease term which typically range from two to five year at the beginning of the lease an estimate is made of the expected residual value at the end of the lease term the expected residual value is based on third party data which considers input including recent auction value the expected future volume of returning leased vehicle used car price manufacturer incentive program and fuel price the customer is obligated to make payment during the term of the lease for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus money factor since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract we are exposed to risk of loss to the extent the customer return the vehicle at the end of the lease term and the value of the vehicle is below the expected residual value estimated at the inception of the lease the following table summarizes vehicle included in gm financial equipment on operating lease net vehicle in thousand december december the estimated residual value of our leased asset at the end of the lease term wa billion we periodically review the adequacy of the depreciation rate if we believe that the expected residual value of the leased asset have changed we revise the depreciation rate to ensure the net investment in the operating lease reflects the revised estimate of expected residual value at the end of the lease term such adjustment to the depreciation rate would result in change in depreciation expense on leased asset which is recorded prospectively on straight line basis the following table illustrates the effect of change in the estimated residual value at december which would increase or decrease depreciation expense over the remaining term of our operating lease portfolio holding all other assumption constant impact to depreciation expensecars also evaluate the carrying value of the operating lease aggregated by vehicle make year and model into leased asset group check for indicator of impairment and test for impairment to the extent necessary in accordance with applicable accounting standard leased asset group is considered impaired if impairment indicator exist and the undiscounted expected future cash flow including the expected residual value are lower than the carrying value of the asset group we believe no impairment indicator existed during or product warranty and recall campaign the estimate related to product warranty are established using historical information on the nature frequency and average cost of claim of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumption about future activity and event when little or no claim experience exists for model year or vehicle line the estimate is based on comparable model in gmna we primarily accrue the cost for recall campaign at the time of vehicle sale in the other region there is not sufficient historical data to support the application of an actuarial based estimation technique and the estimated cost are accrued at the time when they are probable and reasonably estimable which typically occurs once it is determined specific recall campaign is needed and announced of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesthe estimate related to recall campaign accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying frequency time severity approach that considers the number of recall campaign the number of vehicle per recall campaign the assumed number of vehicle that will be brought in by customer for repair take rate and the cost per vehicle for each recall campaign these estimate consider the nature frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaign cost associated with recall campaign not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repair and the estimated vehicle to be repaired depending on part availability and time to complete repair we may from time to time offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customer these estimate are evaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information revision are made when necessary based on change in these factor the estimated amount accrued for recall campaign at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall event the number of vehicle per recall event the take rate and the cost per vehicle for each recall event the estimated cost of recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaign would increase the estimated cost by approximately billion actual experience could differ from the amount estimated requiring adjustment to these liability in future period due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factor contributing to developing estimate change in our assumption could materially affect our result of operation sale incentive the estimated effect of sale incentive offered to dealer and end customer is recorded reduction of automotive net sale and revenue at the later of the time of sale or announcement of an incentive program to dealer there may be numerous type of incentive available at any particular time including choice of incentive for specific model incentive program are generally brand specific model specific or sale region specific and are for specified time period which may be extended significant factor used in estimating the cost of incentive include the volume of vehicle that will be affected by the incentive program offered by product the product mix the rate of customer acceptance of any incentive program and the likelihood that an incentive program will be extended all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumption concerning customer behavior and future market condition when an incentive program is announced the number of vehicle in dealer inventory eligible for the incentive program is determined and reduction of automotive net sale and revenue is recorded in the period in which the program is announced if the actual number of affected vehicle differs from this estimate or if different mix of incentive is actually paid the reduction in automotive net sale and revenue due to incentive could be affected there are multitude of input affecting the calculation of the estimate for sale incentive and an increase or decrease in any of these variable could have significant effect on recorded sale incentive on january the date of our adoption of accounting standard update asu revenue from contract with customer asu sale incentive began to be recorded at the time of sale rather than at the later of sale or announcement this change affected our

to monitor the strategy risk and related hedge position in accordance with the policy and procedure approved by the financial risk council our financial risk management policy is designed to protect against risk arising from extreme adverse market movement on our key exposure automotive the following analysis provide quantitative information regarding exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure the potential loss in the fair value of financial instrument with exposure to market risk the model used assume instantaneous parallel shift in exchange rate and interest rate yield curve for option and other instrument with nonlinear return model appropriate to these type of instrument are utilized to determine the effect of market shift there are certain shortcoming inherent in the sensitivity analysis presented due primarily to the assumption that interest rate change in parallel fashion and that spot exchange rate change instantaneously in addition the analysis are unable to reflect the complex market reaction that normally would arise from the market shift modeled and do not contemplate the effect of correlation between foreign currency pair offsetting long short position in currency pair or other exposure such interest rate which may significantly reduce the potential loss in value foreign currency exchange rate risk we have foreign currency exposure related to buying selling and financing in currency other than the functional currency of our operation at december our most significant foreign currency exposure were the dollar canadian dollar dollar mexican peso euro dollar dollar chinese yuan australian dollar dollar and dollar argentine peso derivative instrument such foreign currency forward swap and option are used primarily to hedge exposure with respect to forecasted revenue cost and commitment denominated in foreign currency such contract had remaining maturity of up to month at december the net fair value liability of financial instrument with exposure to foreign currency risk wa billion at december and these amount are calculated utilizing population of foreign currency exchange derivative and foreign currency denominated debt and exclude the offsetting effect of foreign currency cash cash equivalent and other asset the potential loss in fair value for such financial instrument from adverse change in all quoted foreign currency exchange rate would have been billion and billion at december and of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiarieswe are exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the result of certain international operation into dollar part of the consolidation process we had foreign currency derivative in asset position with notional amount of billion and billion and in liability position with notional amount of billion and billion at december and the fair value of these derivative financial instrument wa insignificant fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate can therefore create volatility in the result of operation and may adversely affect our financial condition the

loss and remeasurement loss recorded in earnings rate risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to change in interest rate related to certain financial instrument primarily debt capital lease obligation and certain marketable security we did not have any interest rate swap position to manage interest rate exposure in our automotive operation at december and the fair value liability of debt and capital lease wa billion and billion at december and the potential increase in fair value resulting from decrease in quoted interest rate would have been billion and billion at december and we had marketable security of billion and billion classified available for sale at december and the potential decrease in fair value from basis point increase in interest rate would have had an insignificant effect at december and automotive financing gm financialinterest rate risk fluctuation in market interest rate can affect gm financial gross interest rate spread which is the difference between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid on debt typically retail finance receivables purchased by gm financial bear fixed interest rate and are funded by variable or fixed rate debt commercial finance receivables originated by gm financial bear variable interest rate and are funded by variable rate debt the variable rate debt is subject to adjustment to reflect prevailing market interest rate to help mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding gm financial may employ hedging strategy to lock in the interest rate spread fixed interest rate receivables purchased by gm financial may be pledged to secure borrowing under it credit facility amount borrowed under these credit facility bear interest at variable rate that are subject to frequent adjustment to reflect prevailing market interest rate to protect the interest rate spread within each credit facility gm financial is contractually required to enter into interest rate cap agreement in connection with borrowing under it credit facility in gm financial securitization transaction it can transfer fixed rate finance receivables to securitization trust that in turn sell either fixed rate or floating rate security to investor derivative financial instrument such interest rate swap and cap are used to manage the gross interest rate spread on the floating rate transaction quantitative disclosure we have historically presented quantitative measure of our interest rate risk in tabular disclosure of our interest sensitive asset and liability with the expansion of our international and north america asset liability committee in to incorporate more asset liability management strategy we now measure the sensitivity of our net interest income to change in interest rate by using interest rate scenario that assume hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift of one hundred basis point in all interest rate across all maturity well base case that assumes that rate perform at the current market forward curve however interest rate change are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rate could move more or le than the one percentage point assumed in our analysis therefore the actual impact to economic value of equity could be higher or lower than the result detailed in the table below these interest rate scenario are purely hypothetical and do not represent our view of future interest rate movement under these interest rate scenario we are asset sensitive meaning that we expect more asset than liability to re price within the next twelve month during period of rising interest rate the interest earned on our asset will increase more than the interest paid on our debt which would initially increase our net interest income during period of falling interest rate we would expect of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesour net interest income to initially decrease the following table present our net interest income sensitivity to interest rate movement year ended december hundred basis point instantaneous increase in interest rate one hundred basis point instantaneous decrease in interest rate net interest income sensitivity given one hundred basis point decrease in interest rate requires an assumption of negative interest rate in market where existing interest rate are below one percent additional model assumption the sensitivity analysis presented is our best estimate of the effect of the hypothetical interest rate scenario however our actual result could differ our estimate are also based on assumption including the amortization and prepayment of the finance receivable portfolio origination of finance receivables and lease refinancing of maturing debt replacement of maturing derivative and exercise of option embedded in debt and derivative our prepayment projection are based on historical experience if interest rate or other factor change our actual prepayment experience could be different than projected foreign currency exchange rate risk gm financial is exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the result of certain international operation into dollar part of the consolidation process fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate can therefore create volatility in the result of operation and may adversely affect gm financial financial condition gm financial primarily finance it receivables and leased asset with debt in the same currency when different currency is used gm financial may use foreign currency swap to convert substantially all of it foreign currency debt obligation to the local currency of the receivables and lease asset to minimize any impact to earnings gm financial had foreign currency swap in asset position with notional amount of billion and an insignificant amount and in liability position with notional amount of an insignificant amount and billion at december and the fair value of these derivative financial instrument wa insignificant the

significant funded benefit plan market related value of plan asset methodology is also utilized that average gain and loss on the plan asset over period of year to determine future pension expense the methodology recognizes of the difference between the fair value of asset and the expected calculated value in the first year and of that difference over each of the next four year the discount rate assumption is established for each of the retirement related benefit plan at their respective measurement date in the we use cash flow matching approach that us projected cash flow matched to spot rate along high quality corporate bond yield curve to determine the present value of cash flow to calculate single equivalent discount rate effective we applied the individual annual yield curve rate instead of the single equivalent discount rate to determine the service cost and interest cost for our pension and opeb plan this refinement more specifically link the cash flow related to service cost and interest cost to bond maturing in their year of payment the benefit obligation for pension plan in canada the and germany represents of the non pension benefit obligation at december the discount rate for plan in canada the and germany are determined using cash flow matching approach similar to the plan asset valuation due to the lack of timely available market information for certain investment in the asset class described below well the inherent uncertainty of valuation reported fair value may differ from fair value that would have been used had timely available market information been available common and preferred stock common and preferred stock for which market price are readily available at the measurement date are valued at the last reported sale price or official closing price on the primary market or exchange on which they are actively traded and are classified in level such equity security for which the market is not considered to be active are valued via the use of observable input which may include among others the use of adjusted market price last available bid or last available sale price and or other observable input and are classified

consider among others aged stale pricing earnings multiple discounted cash flow and or other qualitative and quantitative factor debt security valuation for debt security are based on quotation received from independent pricing service or from dealer who make market in such security debt security priced via pricing service that utilize matrix pricing which considers readily observable input such the yield or price of bond of comparable quality coupon maturity and type well dealer supplied price are classified in level debt security that are typically priced by dealer and pricing service

future activity and event revision are made when necessary and are based on change in these factor the estimated cost related to recall campaign are generally accrued at the time of vehicle sale in gmna by applying frequency time severity approach that considers the number of historical recall campaign the number of vehicle per recall campaign the estimated number of vehicle to be repaired and the cost per vehicle for each recall campaign the estimated cost associated with recall campaign in other geographical region are accrued when probable and estimable using the estimated cost of repair and the estimated number of vehicle to be repaired cost associated with recall campaign are charged to automotive cost of sale revision are made when necessary based on change in these factor income tax the liability method is used in accounting for income tax deferred tax asset and liability are recorded for temporary difference between the tax basis of asset and liability and their reported

change in tax rate is recorded in the result of operation in the period that includes the enactment date under the law deferred income tax asset are evaluated quarterly to determine if valuation allowance are required or should be adjusted we establish valuation allowance for deferred tax asset based on more likely than not standard the ability to realize deferred tax asset depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward period provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction the assessment regarding whether valuation allowance is required or should be adjusted also considers all available positive and negative evidence factor it is difficult to conclude valuation allowance is not required when there is significant objective and verifiable negative evidence such cumulative loss in recent year we utilize rolling three year of actual and current year result the primary measure of cumulative loss in recent year income tax expense benefit for the year is allocated between continuing operation and other category of income such other comprehensive income loss in period in which there is pre tax loss from continuing operation and pre tax income in another income category the tax benefit allocated to continuing operation is determined by taking into account the pre tax income of other category we record uncertain tax position on the basis of two step process whereby we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained based on the technical merit of the position and for those tax position that meet the more likely than not criterion we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related

for retroactive application of this rule would be barred under certain circumstance in on reconsideration the seoul high court held in gm korea favor after which the plaintiff appealed to the supreme

retrospective nature of this matter psa group transaction our wholly owned subsidiary the seller ha agreed to indemnify psa group for certain loss resulting from any inaccuracy of the representation and warranty or breach of our covenant included in the agreement and for certain other liability including emission and product liability the company ha entered into guarantee for the benefit of psa group and pursuant to which the company ha agreed to guarantee the seller obligation to indemnify psa group certain of these indemnification obligation are subject to time limitation threshold and or cap to the amount of required payment we are currently unable to estimate any reasonably possible overall amount or range of loss that may result from claim made under these indemnity if any psa group ha provided number of working capital and other adjustment under the agreement and other ancillary agreement many of which are customary in these type of transaction we currently believe that post

the duramax suit including putative shareholder class action claiming violation of federal security law the security and shareholder demand lawsuit have been voluntarily stayed by the plaintiff at this stage of these proceeding we are unable to provide an evaluation of the likelihood that loss will be incurred or an estimate of the amount or range of possible loss we believe that appropriate accrual have been established for loss that are probable and can be reasonably estimated it is possible that the resolution of one or more of these matter could exceed the amount accrued in an amount that could be material to our result of operation we also from time to time receive subpoena and other inquiry or request for information from agency or other representative of federal state and

involve compensatory punitive or other treble damage claim environmental remediation program or sanction that if granted could require to pay damage or make other expenditure in amount that could not be reasonably estimated at december we believe that appropriate accrual have been established for loss that are probable and can be reasonably estimated for indirect tax related matter we estimate our reasonably possible loss in excess of amount accrued to be up to approximately billion at december of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statement continued takata matter in may nhtsa issued an amended consent order requiring takata to file dirs for previously unrecalled front airbag inflator that contain phased stabilized ammonium nitrate based propellant without moisture absorbing desiccant on multi year risk based schedule through impacting ten of million of vehicle produced by numerous automotive manufacturer nhtsa concluded that the likely root cause of the rupturing of the airbag inflator is function of time temperature cycling and environmental moisture although we do not believe there is safety defect at this time in any unrecalled gm vehicle within scope of the takata dirs in cooperation with nhtsa we filed preliminary dirs on may updated of june covering million of certain of our vehicle which are full size pick up truck and suv on november we filed petition for inconsequentiality and request for deferral of determination regarding those vehicle on november nhtsa granted gm deferral request in connection with this petition the deferral provided gm until august to present evidence and analysis that our vehicle do not pose an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety we filed second set of preliminary dirs for certain vehicle on january these january dirs are consistent with gm may dirs on the same day we also filed second petition for inconsequentiality and deferral of decision with respect to the vehicle subject to our january dirs on january nhtsa consolidated our first and second petition for inconsequentiality and will rule on both at the same time on august we filed supplemental brief in support of our petition that provided nhtsa with the result of our long term study and testing and the basis for our determination that the inflator in these vehicle do not present an unreasonable risk to safety and that no repair should ultimately be required in our brief we requested that nhtsa grant our petition or in the alternative grant an additional deferral period to provide time for further testing we filed third set of preliminary dirs for certain vehicle on january these january dirs are consistent with gm may dirs and january dirs on the same day we also filed third petition for inconsequentiality with respect to the vehicle subject to our january dirs we believe these vehicle are currently performing designed and ongoing testing continues to support the belief that the vehicle unique design and integration mitigates against inflator propellant degradation and rupture risk for example the airbag inflator used in the vehicle are variant engineered specifically for our vehicle and include feature such greater venting unique propellant wafer configuration and machined steel end cap the inflator are packaged in the instrument panel in such way to minimize exposure to moisture from the climate control system also these vehicle have feature that minimize the maximum temperature to which the inflator will be exposed such larger interior volume and standard solar absorbing windshield and side glass accordingly no warranty provision ha been made for any repair associated with our vehicle subject to the preliminary dirs and amended consent order however in the event we are ultimately obligated to repair the vehicle subject to current or future takata dirs under the amended consent order in the we estimate reasonably possible impact to gm of approximately billion gm is engaged in discussion with regulator outside the with respect to takata inflator there are difference in vehicle and inflator design between the relevant vehicle sold internationally and those sold in the we continue to gather and analyze evidence about these inflator and to share our finding with regulator we were required to recall certain vehicle sold outside of the in the three month ended september to replace takata inflator in these vehicle additional recall if any could be material to our result of operation and cash flow we continue to monitor the international situation through january we are aware of one putative class action pending against gm in federal court in the one putative class action in mexico and three putative class action pending in various provincial court in canada arising out of allegation that airbag inflator manufactured by takata are defective at this early stage of these proceeding we are unable to provide an evaluation of the likelihood that loss will be incurred or an estimate of the amount or range of possible loss on august the bankruptcy court hearing the takata bankruptcy entered an order staying all takata related litigation against automotive manufacturer including gm through february product liability with respect to product liability claim other than claim relating to the ignition switch recall discussed above

available information guarantee we enter into indemnification agreement for liability claim involving product manufactured primarily by certain joint venture we also provide vehicle repurchase
