comparable store and club sale or comparable sale metric that indicates the performance of our existing store and club by measuring the change in sale for such store and club including ecommerce sale for particular period from the corresponding period in the previous year walmart definition of comparable sale includes sale from store and club open for the previous month including remodels relocation expansion and conversion well ecommerce sale we measure the ecommerce sale impact by including all sale initiated digitally including omni channel transaction which are fulfilled through our store and club sale at store that ha changed in format are excluded from comparable sale when the conversion of that store is accompanied by relocation or expansion that result in change in the store retail square foot of more than five percent sale related to divested business are excluded from comparable sale and sale related to acquisition are excluded until such acquisition have been owned for month comparable sale are also referred to same store sale by others within the retail industry the method of calculating comparable sale varies across the retail industry result our calculation of comparable sale is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measure reported by other company in discussing our operating result the term currency exchange rate refers to the currency exchange rate we use to convert the operating result for country where the functional currency is not the dollar into dollar we calculate the effect of change in currency exchange rate the difference between current period activity translated using the current period currency exchange rate and the comparable prior year period currency exchange rate additionally no currency exchange rate fluctuation are calculated for non usd acquisition until owned for month throughout our discussion we refer to the result of this calculation the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuation volatility in currency exchange rate may impact the result including net sale and operating income of the company and the walmart international segment in the future we have taken certain strategic action to strengthen our walmart international portfolio for the long term including the following highlight over the last three year in november we completed the sale of walmart argentina and recorded pre tax non cash loss in fiscal of billion primarily due to cumulative foreign currency translation loss refer to note in february we completed the sale of asda for net consideration of billion for which we recognized an estimated pre tax loss in fiscal of billion and an incremental loss of billion in fiscal upon closing of the transaction refer to note and note in march we completed the sale of seiyu for net consideration of billion for which we recognized an estimated pre tax loss in fiscal of billion and an incremental loss of billion in fiscal upon closing of the transaction refer to note we operate in the highly competitive omni channel retail industry in all of the market we serve we face strong sale competition from other discount department drug dollar variety and specialty store warehouse club and supermarket well ecommerce health and wellness financial service advertising and data service business many of these competitor are national regional or international chain or have national or international omni channel or ecommerce presence we compete with number of company for attracting and retaining quality associate we along with other retail company are influenced by number of factor including but not limited to catastrophic event weather and other risk related to climate change global health epidemic including the covid pandemic competitive pressure consumer disposable income consumer debt level and buying pattern consumer credit availability supply chain disruption cost and availability of good currency exchange rate fluctuation customer preference deflation inflation fuel and energy price economic condition insurance cost interest rate labor availability and cost tax rate the imposition of tariff cybersecurity attack and unemployment further information on the factor that can affect our operating result and on certain risk to our company and an investment in it security can be found herein under item risk factor we expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to the duration and intensity of the covid pandemic the duration and extent of economic stimulus measure effectiveness and extent of administration of vaccination and medical treatment supply chain disruption and volatility in employment trend and consumer confidence which may impact our result for detailed discussion

and expanding omni channel initiative that complement our flywheel strategy while slowing the rate of growth of new store and club at time we make strategic investment which are focused on the long term growth of the company comparable sale is metric that indicates the performance of our existing store and club by measuring the change in sale for such store and club including ecommerce sale for particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year the retail industry generally report comparable sale using the retail calendar also known the calendar to be consistent with the retail industry we provide comparable sale using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings release however when we discus our comparable sale below we are referring to our calendar comparable sale calculated using our fiscal calendar which may result in difference when compared to comparable sale using the retail calendar calendar comparable sale including the impact of fuel for fiscal and were follows fiscal year ended january with fuelfuel impactwalmart sam total comparable sale in the including fuel increased and in fiscal and respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year walmart comparable sale increased and in fiscal and respectively for fiscal comparable sale growth wa driven by growth in average ticket and transaction which includes strong consumer spending from government stimulus and some higher inflation impact in certain merchandise category compared to recent year in the first quarter of fiscal average ticket increased while transaction decreased customer consolidated shopping trip and purchased larger basket transaction growth turned positive in april and continued with strong growth through the rest of the year customer pre pandemic behavior largely resumed for fiscal comparable sale growth wa driven by growth in average ticket primarily resulting from meeting the increased demand due to economic condition related to the covid pandemic while transaction decreased customer consolidated shopping trip walmart ecommerce sale positively contributed approximately and to comparable sale for fiscal and respectively we continue to focus on seamless omni channel experience for our customer sam club comparable sale increased and in fiscal and respectively for fiscal sam club comparable sale benefited from growth in transaction and average ticket and wa aided by consumer spending due to government stimulus and also includes some higher inflation impact in certain merchandise category compared to recent year the growth in comparable sale wa partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club location sam club comparable sale for fiscal benefited from growth in transaction and average ticket resulting from the covid pandemic partially offset by both our decision to remove tobacco from certain club location and by lower fuel sale sam club ecommerce sale positively contributed approximately and to comparable sale for fiscal and respectively operating disciplinewe operate with discipline by managing expense optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowest cost to serve we invest in technology and process improvement to increase productivity manage inventory and reduce cost we measure operating discipline through expense leverage which we define net sale growing at faster rate than operating selling general and administrative operating expense fiscal year ended january amount in million except unit count sale percentage change from comparable operating selling general and administrative expense percentage change from comparable operating selling general and administrative expense percentage of net for fiscal operating expense percentage of net sale decreased basis point when compared to the previous fiscal year operating expense percentage of net sale benefited from growth in comparable sale and lower incremental covid related cost of billion compared to the previous year partially offset by increased wage investment primarily in the walmart segment for fiscal operating expense percentage of net sale wa flat when compared to the previous fiscal year operating expense percentage of net sale benefited from strong growth in comparable sale offset by billion of incremental cost related to the covid pandemic strategic capital allocationour strategy includes improving our customer facing initiative in store and club and creating seamless omni channel experience for our customer such we continue to allocate more capital to supply chain omni channel initiative technology and store remodels and le to new store and club opening the following table provides additional detail amount in million fiscal year ended january allocation of capital chain omni channel technology and other new store and club including expansion and total walmart total capital expenditure returnsas we execute our financial framework we believe our return on capital will improve over time we measure return on capital with our return on asset return on investment and free cash flow metric we also provide return in the form of share repurchase and dividend which are discussed in the liquidity and capital resource section return on asset and return on investment we include return on asset roa the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statement presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle in the gaap and return on investment roi metric to ass return on asset while roi is considered non gaap financial measure management belief roi is meaningful metric to share with investor because it help investor ass how effectively walmart is deploying it asset trend in roi can fluctuate over time management balance long term strategic initiative with possible short term impact roa wa for both fiscal and respectively roi wa and for fiscal and respectively which increased primarily due to the increase in operating income we define roi adjusted operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the trailing twelve month divided by average invested capital during that period we consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total asset plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization le average account payable and average accrued liability for that period our calculation of roi is considered non gaap financial measure because we calculate roi using financial measure that exclude and include amount that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable gaap financial measure for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi mentioned above we consider roa to be the financial measure computed in accordance with gaap most directly comparable to our calculation of roi roi differs from roa which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total asset for the period because roi adjusts operating income to exclude certain item and add interest income and adjusts total asset for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization account payable and accrued liability to arrive at total invested capital because of the adjustment mentioned above we believe roi more accurately measure how we are deploying our key asset and is more meaningful to investor than roa although roi is standard financial measure numerous method exist for calculating company roi result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the method used by other company to calculate their roi the calculation of roa and roi along with reconciliation of roi to the calculation of roa the most comparable gaap financial measure is follows fiscal year ended january amount in million of return on assetsnumeratorconsolidated net income denominatoraverage total asset return on asset roa calculation of return on investmentnumeratoroperating income interest depreciation and roi operating income denominatoraverage total asset average accumulated depreciation and amortization average account payable average accrued liability average invested capital return on investment roi the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by of january balance sheet data total asset accumulated depreciation and account accrued free cash flowfree cash flow is considered non gaap financial measure management belief however that free cash flow which measure our ability to generate additional cash from our business operation is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the company financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than substitute for consolidated net income measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activity measure of our liquidity see liquidity and capital resource for discussion of gaap metric including net cash provided by operating activity net cash used in investing activity and net cash used in financing activity we define free cash flow net cash provided by operating activity in period minus payment for property and equipment made in that period we had net cash provided by operating activity of billion billion and billion for fiscal and respectively we generated free cash flow of billion billion and billion for fiscal and respectively net cash provided by operating activity for fiscal decreased when compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in inventory cost and purchase to support strong sale and lapping the impact of accelerated inventory sell through in fiscal well timing and payment of wage free cash flow for fiscal decreased when compared to fiscal due to the same reason the decrease in net cash provided by operating activity well billion in increased capital expenditure net cash provided by operating activity for fiscal increased when compared to fiscal primarily due to the impact of the global health crisis which accelerated inventory sell through well the timing and payment of inventory purchase incremental covid related expense and certain benefit payment free cash flow for increased when compared to fiscal due to the same reason the increase in net cash provided by operating activity well billion in decreased capital expenditure walmart definition of free cash flow is limited in that it doe not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditure due to the fact that the measure doe not deduct the payment required for debt service and other contractual obligation or payment made for business acquisition therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow measure that provides supplemental information to our consolidated statement of cash flow although other company report their free cash flow numerous method may exist for calculating company free cash flow result the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the method used by other company to calculate their free cash flow the following table set forth reconciliation of free cash flow non gaap financial measure to net cash provided by operating activity which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow well information regarding net cash used in investing activity and net cash used in financing activity fiscal year ended january amount in million cash provided by operating activity payment for property and equipment free cash flow net cash used in investing activity net cash used in financing activity net cash used in investing activity includes payment for property and equipment which is also included in our computation of free cash flow

international operation classified held for sale or sold in fiscal our effective income tax rate wa for fiscal for fiscal and for fiscal the decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal compared to fiscal and the increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to the billion loss related to the divestiture of certain international operation classified held for

contingency valuation allowance change in tax law outcome of administrative audit the impact of discrete item and the mix and size of earnings among our operation and international operation which are subject to statutory rate that are generally higher than the statutory rate the reconciliation from the statutory rate to the effective income tax rate for fiscal and is presented in note result of

change in our operating performance the general economic environment condition in the retail industry our financial position including our total debt and capitalization and change in our business strategy any downgrade of our credit rating by credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing cost or impair our ability to access capital and credit market on term commercially acceptable to in addition any downgrade of our current short term credit rating could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically potentially requiring to rely more heavily on more expensive type of debt financing the credit rating agency rating are not recommendation to buy sell or hold our commercial paper or debt security

require to use technical terminology in preparing the company consolidated financial statement we follow accounting principle generally accepted in the these principle require to make certain estimate and apply judgment that affect our financial position and result of operation reflected in our financial statement these judgment and estimate are based on past event and expectation of future outcome actual result may differ from our estimate management continually review our accounting policy how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statement following is summary of our critical accounting estimate and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statement inventorieswe value inventory at the lower of cost or market determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting using the last in first out lifo method for walmart segment inventory the inventory at the sam club segment is valued using the weighted average cost lifo method when necessary we record lifo provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation and these estimate are adjusted to actual result determined at year end our lifo provision is calculated based on inventory level markup rate and internally generated retail price index measure of sensitivity increase to our retail price index would not have resulted in decrease to the carrying value of inventory of january and our inventory valued at lifo approximated those inventory if they were valued at first in first out fifo of assetswe evaluate long lived asset for indicator of impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable management judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicator are based on market condition and financial performance the evaluation of long lived asset is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flow which is generally at the individual store level the variability of these factor depends on number of condition including uncertainty about future event and change in demographic thus our accounting estimate may change from period to period these factor could cause management to conclude that indicator of impairment exist and require impairment test be performed which could result in management determining the value of long lived asset is impaired resulting in write down of the related long lived asset impairment charge on asset held and used were immaterial in fiscal and measure of sensitivity fiscal impairment would not change materially with decrease in the undiscounted cash flow for the store or club with indicator of impairment in fiscal the company operation in argentina the united kingdom and japan met the held for sale criterion result the individual disposal group were measured at fair value le cost to sell which resulted in impairment charge that were included in the total estimated pre tax loss of billion recorded in fiscal well billion in incremental charge associated with the united kingdom and japan divestiture upon closing of the transaction during the first quarter of fiscal refer to note business combination goodwill and acquired intangible assetswe account for business combination using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that once control is obtained all the asset acquired and liability assumed including amount attributable to noncontrolling interest are recorded at their respective fair value at the date of acquisition the determination of fair value of identifiable asset and liability requires estimate and the use of valuation technique when market value is not readily available for intangible asset acquired in business combination we typically use the income method significant estimate in valuing certain intangible asset include but are not limited to the amount and timing of future cash flow growth rate discount rate and useful life the excess of the purchase price over fair value of identifiable asset and liability is recorded goodwill goodwill is typically assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition component within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed single reporting unit if the component have similar economic characteristic of january our reporting unit consisted of walmart walmart international and sam club goodwill and other indefinite lived acquired intangible asset are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the value of certain asset may be impaired generally this evaluation begin with qualitative assessment to determine whether quantitative impairment test is necessary if we determine after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factor that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not le than the carrying amount or that fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount can not be assured then quantitative impairment test would be performed the quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgment relating to future cash flow growth rate and economic and market condition these evaluation are based on determining the fair value of reporting unit or asset using valuation method such discounted cash flow or relative market based approach historically our reporting unit have generated sufficient return to recover the cost of goodwill the fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value our indefinite lived acquired intangible asset have also historically generated sufficient return to recover their cost because of the nature of the factor used in these test if different condition occur in future period future operating result could be materially impacted due to certain strategic restructuring decision we recorded approximately billion in impairment in fiscal related to acquired trade name and acquired developed software contingencieswe are involved in number of legal proceeding we record liability when it is probable that loss ha been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable we also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss contingency where loss is either not probable or it is reasonably possible that loss could be incurred in excess of amount accrued if loss or an additional loss ha at least reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statement would be material we provide disclosure of the loss contingency in the footnote to our financial statement we review all contingency at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss ha changed and to ass whether reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made although we are not able to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate range of possible loss in certain matter described in note to our consolidated financial statement and have not recorded an associated accrual related to these matter an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matter could have material adverse effect on our business reputation financial position result of operation or cash flow taxesincome tax have significant effect on our net earnings we are subject to income tax in the and numerous foreign jurisdiction accordingly the determination of our provision for income tax requires judgment the use of estimate in certain case and the interpretation and application of complex tax law our effective income tax rate is affected by many factor including change in our assessment of certain tax contingency increase and decrease in valuation allowance change in tax law outcome of administrative audit the impact of discrete item and the mix of earnings among our and international operation where the statutory rate are generally higher than the statutory rate and may fluctuate result our tax return are routinely audited and settlement of issue raised in these audit sometimes affect our tax provision the benefit of uncertain tax position are recorded in our financial statement only after determining more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax position will withstand challenge if any from taxing authority when fact and circumstance change we reassess these probability and record any change in the financial statement appropriate we account for uncertain tax position by determining the minimum recognition threshold that tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statement this determination requires the use of judgment in evaluating our tax position and assessing the timing and amount of deductible and taxable item deferred tax asset represent amount available to reduce income tax payable on taxable income in future year such asset arise because of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax base of asset and liability well from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax asset are evaluated for future realization and reduced by valuation allowance to the extent that portion is not more likely than not to be realized many factor are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized including recent cumulative earnings expectation of future taxable income carryforward period and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factor the recoverability of the deferred tax asset is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all source including reversal of taxable temporary difference forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategy this evaluation relies on estimate guidance is issued by the treasury department the irs and other standard setting body any resulting change to our estimate will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskmarket riskin addition to the

below for each of our market risk sensitive instrument is based on hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and doe not represent our view of future market change the effect of change in particular assumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption in reality however change in one factor could cause change in another which may magnify or negate other sensitivity interest rate riskwe are exposed to change in interest rate result of our short term borrowing and long term debt we hedge portion of our interest rate risk by managing the mix of fixed and variable rate debt
