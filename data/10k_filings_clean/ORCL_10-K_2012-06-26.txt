reach by providing our partner with the resource they need to be successful in delivering solution to customer globally the majority of our hardware system product are sold through indirect channel including independent distributor and value added resellers seasonality and cyclicality our quarterly revenue have historically been affected by variety of seasonal factor including the structure of our sale force incentive compensation plan which are common in the technology industry our total revenue and operating margin are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fiscal quarter the operating margin of our business are generally affected by seasonal factor in similar manner our revenue in particular our new software license segment certain expense within our cost structure are relatively fixed in the short term see selected quarterly financial data in item of this annual report for more complete description of the seasonality and cyclicality of our revenue expense and margin competition we face intense competition in all aspect of our business the nature of the it industry creates competitive landscape that is constantly evolving firm emerge expand or are acquired technology evolves and customer demand and competitive pressure otherwise change our customer are demanding le complexity and lower total cost in the implementation sourcing integration and ongoing maintenance of their enterprise software and hardware system our enterprise software and hardware offering compete directly with offering from some of the largest and most competitive company in the world including microsoft corporation microsoft international business machine corporation ibm intel hewlett packard company hp and sap ag and smaller company like salesforce com well many others in addition the low barrier to entry in many of our market segment regularly introduce new technology and new and growing competitor to challenge our offering our competitor range from company offering broad it solution across many of our line of business to vendor providing point solution or offering focused on specific functionality product area or industry in addition we expand into new market segment we will face increased competition we will compete with existing competitor well firm that may be partner in other area of our business and other firm with we have not previously competed moreover we or our competitor may take certain strategic action including acquisition partnership and joint venture or repositioning of product line which invite even greater competition in one or more product category key competitive factor in each of the segment in which we currently compete and may compete in the future include total cost of ownership performance scalability reliability security functionality efficiency ease of management and quality of technical support our product sale and the relative strength of our product versus those of our competitor are also directly and indirectly affected by the following among other thing the adoption of saas hosted or cloud software offering the adoption of commodity server and microprocessor table of content the broader platform competition our industry standard java technology platform and the net programming environment of microsoft operating system competition among primarily our oracle solaris operating system microsoft window server unix including hp ux from hp and aix from ibm and linux the adoption of open source alternative to commercial software by enterprise software customer product feature and functionality developed internally by customer and their it staff product feature or functionality customized and implemented for customer by consultant system integrator or other third party and attractiveness of offering from business processing outsourcers for more information about the competitive risk we face refer to item risk factor manufacturing to produce our hardware system product we rely on both our internal manufacturing operation well third party manufacturing partner our internal manufacturing operation consist primarily of final assembly test and quality control of our enterprise and data center server and storage system for substantially all other manufacturing we rely on third party manufacturing partner we distribute most of our hardware system product either from our facility or partner facility our manufacturing process are based on standardization of component across product type centralization of assembly and distribution center and build to order methodology in which product generally are built only customer have placed firm order production of our hardware product requires that we purchase material supply product subassemblies and full assembly from number of vendor for most of our hardware product we have existing alternate source of supply or such source are readily available however we do rely on sole source for certain of our hardware product result we continue to evaluate potential risk of disruption to our supply chain operation refer to risk factor included in item within this annual report for additional discussion of the challenge we encounter with respect to the source and availability of supply for our product and the related risk to our business research and development we develop the substantial majority of our product internally in addition we have extended our product offering and intellectual property through acquisition of business and technology we also purchase or license intellectual property right in certain circumstance internal development allows to maintain technical control over the design and development of our product we have number of united state and foreign patent and pending application that relate to various aspect of our product and technology while we believe that our patent have value no single patent is essential to or to any of our principal business segment research and development expenditure billion in each of fiscal and and billion in fiscal or and of total revenue in fiscal and respectively rapid technological advance in hardware and software development evolving standard in computer hardware and software technology changing customer need and frequent new product introduction and enhancement characterize the software and hardware market in which we compete we plan to continue to dedicate significant amount of resource to research and development effort to maintain and improve our current product and service offering employee of may we

corporate controller and chief accounting officer from april to february previous experience includes year with arthur andersen llp most recently partner table of content item risk factor we operate in rapidly changing economic and technological environment that present numerous risk many of which are driven by factor that we can not control or predict the following discussion well our critical accounting policy and estimate discussion in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation item highlight some of these risk the risk described below are not exhaustive and you should carefully consider these risk and uncertainty investing in our security economic political and market condition can adversely affect our business result of operation and financial condition including our revenue growth and profitability which in turn could adversely affect our stock price our business is influenced by range of factor that are beyond our control and that we have no comparative advantage in forecasting these include general economic and business condition the overall demand for enterprise software hardware system and service governmental budgetary constraint or shift in government spending priority general political development and currency exchange rate fluctuation macroeconomic development like the debt crisis in certain country in the european union and slowing economy in part of asia and south america could negatively affect our business operating result or financial condition which in turn could adversely affect our stock price general weakening of and related declining corporate confidence in the global economy or the curtailment in government or corporate spending could cause current or potential customer to reduce their information technology it budget or be unable to fund software hardware system or service purchase which could cause customer to delay decrease or cancel purchase of our product and service or cause customer not to pay or to delay paying for previously purchased product and service in addition political unrest in region like the middle east terrorist attack around the globe and the potential for other hostility in various part of the world potential public health crisis and natural disaster continue to contribute to climate of economic and political uncertainty that could adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition including our revenue growth and profitability these factor generally have the strongest effect on our sale of new software license hardware system product hardware system support and related service and to lesser extent also may affect our renewal rate for software license update and product support we may fail to achieve our financial forecast due to inaccurate sale forecast or other factor our revenue and particularly our new software license revenue and hardware system product revenue are difficult to forecast and result our quarterly operating result can fluctuate substantially our limited experience with managing our hardware business and forecasting it future financial result creates additional challenge with our forecasting process we use pipeline system common industry practice to forecast sale and trend in our business our sale personnel monitor the status of all proposal and estimate when customer will make purchase decision and the dollar amount of the sale these estimate are aggregated periodically to generate sale pipeline our pipeline estimate can prove to be unreliable both in particular quarter and over longer period of time in part the conversion rate or closure rate of the pipeline into contract can be difficult to estimate contraction in the conversion rate or in the pipeline could cause to plan or budget incorrectly and adversely affect our business or result of operation in particular slowdown in it spending or economic condition generally can unexpectedly reduce the conversion rate in particular period purchasing decision are delayed reduced in amount or cancelled the conversion rate can also be affected by the tendency of some of our customer to wait until the end of fiscal period in the hope of obtaining more favorable term which can also impede our ability to negotiate execute and deliver upon these contract in timely manner in addition for table of content newly acquired company we have limited ability to predict how their pipeline will convert into sale or revenue for number of quarter following the acquisition conversion rate post acquisition may be quite different from the acquired company historical conversion rate difference in conversion rate can also be affected by change in our business practice that we implement with our newly acquired company that may affect customer behavior substantial portion of our new software license revenue contract and hardware system product contract is completed in the latter part of quarter and significant percentage of these are large order because significant portion of our cost structure is largely fixed in the short term revenue shortfall tend to have disproportionately negative impact on our profitability the number of large new software license transaction and to lesser extent hardware system product transaction also increase the risk of fluctuation in our quarterly result because delay in even small number of these transaction could cause our quarterly revenue and profitability to fall significantly short of our prediction our success depends upon our ability to develop new product and service integrate acquired product and service and enhance our existing product and service rapid technological advance and evolving standard in computer hardware and software development and communication infrastructure changing and increasingly sophisticated customer need and frequent new product introduction and enhancement characterize the enterprise software and hardware system market in which we compete if we are unable to develop new or sufficiently differentiated product and service or enhance and improve our product and support service in timely manner or to position and or price our product and service to meet demand customer may not buy new software license or hardware system product or purchase or renew software license update and product support or hardware system support contract renewal of these support contract are important to the growth of our business in addition it standard from both consortium and formal standard setting forum well de facto marketplace standard are rapidly evolving we can not provide any assurance that the standard on which we choose to develop new product will allow to compete effectively for business opportunity in emerging area we have released oracle fusion application the next generation of our application software offering which are designed to unify the best of business functional capability from all of our application on an open standard based technology foundation accessible by customer through the cloud or on premise we have also recently designed and built our oracle engineered system product offering including oracle exadata database machine fast database warehousing machine that run online transaction processing application oracle exalogic elastic cloud an integrated cloud machine which ha server hardware and middleware software that have been engineered together oracle exalytics in memory machine an engineered system featuring in memory software and hardware and an optimized business intelligence platform and sparc supercluster an engineered system which combine optimized database performance with accelerated middleware processing capability among others if we do not continue to develop and release these or other new or enhanced product and service within the anticipated time frame if there is delay in market acceptance of new enhanced or acquired product line or service if there are change in information technology trend for which we do not adequately anticipate or react our product development effort toward if we do not timely optimize complementary product line and service or if we fail to adequately integrate support or enhance acquired product line or service our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new hardware system or software competitor the result of operation and prospect for our business could be harmed through fewer customer order reduced pricing lower revenue or lower profit our hardware system business will compete with among others system manufacturer and resellers of system based on our own microprocessor and operating system and those of our competitor ii microprocessor chip manufacturer and iii provider of storage product our hardware system business may also cause to compete with company who historically have been our partner these competitor may have more experience than we do in managing hardware business large portion of our hardware product are based on our sparc microprocessor and oracle solaris operating system platform which ha smaller installed base than certain of our competitor platform and which may make it difficult for to win new customer that have already made significant investment in our competitor table of content platform certain of these competitor also compete very aggressively on price loss in our competitive position could result in lower revenue or profitability which could adversely impact our ability to realize the revenue and profitability forecast for our hardware system business many vendor develop and market database middleware product application development tool business application collaboration product and business intelligence product amongst others that compete with our software offering in addition several company offer software service saas or cloud computing and business process outsourcing bpo competitive alternative to buying software and hardware and customer interest in cloud or saas solution is increasing some of these competitor have greater financial or technical resource than we do our competitor that offer business application and middleware product may influence customer purchasing decision for the underlying database in an effort to persuade potential customer not to acquire our product we could lose customer if our competitor introduce new competitive product add new functionality acquire competitive product reduce price or form strategic alliance with other company vendor that offer saas cloud or bpo solution may persuade our customer not to purchase our product we may also face increasing competition from open source software initiative in which competitor may provide software and intellectual property for free existing or new competitor could gain sale opportunity or customer at our expense our hardware system offering are complex product if we can not successfully manage the required process to meet customer requirement and demand on timely basis the result of our hardware system business will suffer designing developing manufacturing and introducing new hardware system product are complicated process the development process is uncertain and requires high level of innovation from both system hardware and software product designer and engineer and the supplier of the component used in these product the development process is also lengthy and costly new hardware system product is developed we face several challenge in the manufacturing process we must be able to forecast customer demand and manufacture new hardware system product in sufficient volume to meet this demand and do in cost effective manner our build to order manufacturing model in which our hardware system product generally are not built until after customer place order may from time to time experience delay in delivering our hardware system product to customer in timely manner these delay could cause our customer to purchase hardware product and service from our competitor we must also manage new hardware product introduction and transition to minimize the impact of customer delayed purchase of existing hardware system product in anticipation of new hardware system product release because the design and manufacturing process for component are also very complicated it is possible that we could experience design or manufacturing flaw these design or manufacturing flaw could delay or prevent the production of the component for which we have previously committed to pay or need to fulfill order from customer these type of component flaw could also prevent the production of our hardware product or cause our hardware product to be returned recalled or rejected resulting in lost revenue increase in warranty cost or cost related to remediation effort damage to our reputation penalty and litigation acquisition present many risk and we may not realize the financial and strategic goal that were contemplated at the time of transaction in recent year we have invested billion of dollar to acquire number of company product service and technology an active acquisition program is an important element of our overall corporate strategy and we expect to continue to make acquisition in the future risk we may face in connection with our acquisition program include our ongoing business may be disrupted and our management attention may be diverted by acquisition transition or integration activity an acquisition may not further our business strategy we expected we may not integrate an acquired company or technology successfully we expected or we may overpay for or otherwise not realize the expected return on our investment which could adversely affect our business or operating result we may have difficulty managing an acquired company technology or line of business or ii entering new market where we have no or limited direct prior experience or where competitor may have stronger market position table of content our operating result or financial condition may be adversely impacted by claim or liability that we assume from an acquired company or technology or that are otherwise related to an acquisition including claim from government agency terminated employee current or former customer former stockholder or other third party pre existing contractual relationship of an acquired company that we would not have otherwise entered into the termination or modification of which may be costly or disruptive to our business unfavorable revenue recognition or other accounting treatment result of an acquired company practice and intellectual property claim or dispute we may fail to identify or ass the magnitude of certain liability shortcoming or other circumstance prior to acquiring company or technology which could result in unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure unfavorable accounting treatment unexpected increase in tax due loss of anticipated tax benefit or other adverse effect on our business operating result or financial condition we may not realize the anticipated increase in our revenue from an acquisition for number of reason including if larger than predicted number of customer decline to renew software license update and product support contract hardware system support contract and cloud software subscription contract if we are unable to sell the acquired product to our customer base or if contract model of an acquired company do not allow to recognize revenue on timely basis we may have difficulty incorporating acquired technology or product with our existing product line and maintaining uniform standard architecture control procedure and policy we may have multiple product line result of our acquisition that are offered priced and supported differently which could cause customer confusion and delay we may have higher than anticipated cost in continuing support and development of acquired product in general and administrative function that support new business model or in compliance with associated regulation that are more complicated than we anticipated we may be unable to obtain timely approval from or may otherwise have certain limitation restriction penalty or other sanction imposed on by worker council or similar body under applicable employment law result of an acquisition which could adversely affect our integration plan in certain jurisdiction we may be unable to obtain required approval from governmental authority under competition and antitrust law on timely basis if at all which could among other thing delay or prevent from completing transaction otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goal of an acquisition or have other adverse effect on our current business and operation our use of cash to pay for acquisition may limit other potential us of our cash including stock repurchase dividend payment and retirement of outstanding indebtedness we may significantly increase our interest expense leverage and debt service requirement if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition and we may have to delay or not proceed with substantial acquisition if we can not obtain the necessary funding to complete the acquisition in timely manner or on favorable term to the extent that we issue significant amount of equity security in connection with future acquisition existing stockholder may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease and we may experience additional or unexpected change in how we are required to account for our acquisition pursuant to generally accepted accounting principle including arrangement that we assume from an acquisition the occurrence of any of these risk could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition or cash flow particularly in the case of larger acquisition or several concurrent acquisition table of content our hardware system revenue and profitability could decline if we do not manage the risk associated with our hardware system business our hardware system business may adversely affect our overall profitability if we do not manage the associated risk we may not achieve our estimated revenue profit or other financial projection with respect to our hardware system business in timely manner or at all due to number of factor including our relative inexperience in managing hardware system business and related process or the unplanned departure of some important employee could adversely impact our ability to successfully run our hardware system business which could adversely impact our ability to realize the forecast for our hardware system business and it result of operation our focus on our more profitable oracle engineered system product like oracle exadata database machine oracle exalogic elastic cloud and oracle exalytics in memory machine which are in the relatively early stage of adoption by our customer and our de emphasis on our lower profit margin commodity hardware system product that historically constituted larger portion of our hardware system revenue we may forgo sale opportunity customer and revenue result of our reducing the resale of third party product and service for which sun microsystems inc sun historically acted reseller we may not be able to increase sale of hardware system support contract or such increase may take longer than we anticipate which could result in lower revenue and profitability or slower than expected growth of such revenue and profitability our hardware system business ha higher expense percentage of revenue and thus ha been le profitable than our software business we have reported lower overall operating margin percentage of revenue in the past and we may report lower operating margin percentage of revenue in the future and we face greater risk of potential write down and impairment of inventory higher warranty expense than we had historically encountered in our existing software and service business and higher amortization from and potential impairment of intangible asset associated with our hardware system business any of these item could result in material charge and adversely affect our operating result our strategy of transitioning to mixed direct and indirect sale model for our hardware system product may not succeed and could result in lower hardware revenue or profit disruption to our software indirect sale channel could affect our future operating result although we will continue to sell our hardware system product through indirect channel including independent distributor and value added resellers we have enhanced our direct sale coverage for our hardware product and intend that our direct sale force will sell larger portion of our hardware product in the future than they do these direct sale effort however may not be successful our relationship with some of our channel partner may deteriorate because we are reducing our reliance on some of these partner for sale of our hardware product are modifying our approach and timing to the manufacturing of our product and have altered certain of sun legacy business practice with these channel partner which could result in reduced demand from the channel partner or certain customer segment serviced by these channel partner some hardware revenue from channel partner may not be replaced by revenue generated from our own sale personnel or may not be replaced quickly we expect in addition we may not be able to hire qualified hardware salesperson sale consultant and other personnel for our direct sale model at the rate or in the number we need to generate the hardware revenue and profit margin we have projected for future period even if we can meet our hiring need these salesperson may not be able to achieve our sale forecast for our hardware business if we experience any of these risk our hardware revenue and or profit may decline our software indirect channel network is comprised primarily of resellers system integrator implementers consultant education provider internet service provider network integrator and independent software vendor our relationship with these channel participant are important element of our software marketing and sale effort our financial result could be adversely affected if our contract with channel participant were terminated if our relationship with channel participant were to deteriorate if any of our competitor enter into table of content strategic relationship with or acquire significant channel participant or if the financial condition of our channel participant were to weaken there can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining expanding or developing our relationship with channel participant if we are not successful we may lose sale opportunity customer and revenue our international sale and operation subject to additional risk that can adversely affect our operating result we derive substantial portion of our revenue from and have significant operation outside of the united state our international operation include software and hardware system development manufacturing assembly sale customer support consulting managed cloud service and shared administrative service center compliance with international and law and regulation that apply to our international operation increase our cost of business in foreign jurisdiction these law and regulation include law and local law which include data privacy requirement labor relation law tax law anti competition regulation prohibition on payment to governmental official import and trade restriction and export requirement violation of these law and regulation could result in fine criminal sanction against our officer or our employee and prohibition on the conduct of our business any such violation could result in prohibition on our ability to offer our product and service in one or more country could delay or prevent potential acquisition and could also materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion effort our ability to attract and retain employee our business and our operating result our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risk and manage these difficulty we monitor our international operation and investigate allegation of impropriety relating to transaction and the way in which such transaction are recorded where circumstance warrant we provide information and report our finding to government authority but no assurance can be given that action will not be taken by such authority we are also subject to variety of other risk and challenge in managing an organization operating in various country including those related to general economic condition in each country or region fluctuation in currency exchange rate and related impact to our operating result natural disaster regulatory change political unrest terrorism and the potential for other hostility longer payment cycle and difficulty in collecting account receivable overlapping tax regime our ability to repatriate fund held by our foreign subsidiary to the united state at favorable tax rate difficulty in transferring fund from or converting currency in certain country public health risk particularly in area in which we have significant operation and reduced protection for intellectual property right in some country result of our hardware system business the volume and complexity of law and regulation that we are subject to have increased the variety of risk and challenge listed could also disrupt or otherwise negatively impact the supply chain operation for our hardware system product segment and the sale of our product and service in affected country or region the majority shareholder of oracle financial service software limited publicly traded indian software company focused on the banking industry we are faced with several additional risk including being subject to local security regulation and being unable to exert full control the future operating result of our hardware system business will depend on our ability to manage our component inventory to meet the demand of our hardware system customer and to avoid component inventory write down we depend on supplier to design develop manufacture and deliver on timely basis table of content the necessary component for our hardware product while many of the component purchased are standard some component standard or otherwise require long lead time to manufacture and deliver furthermore there are some component that can only be purchased from single vendor due to price quality technology or other business constraint result our supply chain operation could be disrupted or negatively impacted by natural disaster political unrest or other factor affecting the country or region where these single source component vendor are located we may be unable to purchase these item from the respective single vendor on acceptable term or may experience significant delay or quality issue in the delivery of necessary part or component from particular vendor if we had to find new supplier for these part and component hardware system product shipment could be delayed which would adversely affect our hardware system revenue we could also experience fluctuation in component price which if unanticipated could negatively impact our hardware system business cost structure these factor may make it difficult for to plan and procure appropriate component inventory level in timely fashion to meet customer demand for our hardware product therefore we may experience component inventory shortage which may result in production delay or customer choosing to purchase fewer hardware product from or system product from our competitor we negotiate supply commitment with vendor early in the manufacturing process to ensure we have sufficient component for our hardware product to meet anticipated customer demand we must also manage our level of older component inventory used in our hardware product to minimize inventory write offs or write down if we have excess inventory it may be necessary to write the inventory which would adversely affect our operating result if one or more of the risk described above occurs our hardware system business and related operating result could be materially and adversely affected we expect to continue to depend on third party manufacturer to build certain hardware system product and third party logistics provider to deliver our product such we are susceptible to manufacturing and logistics delay that could prevent from shipping customer order on time if at all and may result in the loss of sale and customer we outsource the manufacturing assembly and delivery of certain of our hardware product to variety of company many of which are located outside the united state our reliance on these third party reduces our control over the manufacturing and delivery process exposing to risk including reduced control over quality assurance product cost product supply and delivery delay well the political and economic uncertainty and natural disaster of the international location where certain of these third party manufacturer have facility and operation any manufacturing disruption or logistics delay by these third party could impair our ability to fulfill order for these hardware system product for extended period of time if we are unable to manage our relationship with these third party effectively or if these third party experience delay disruption capacity constraint regulatory issue or quality control problem in their operation or fail to meet our future requirement for timely delivery our ability to ship and or deliver certain of our hardware system product to our customer could be impaired and our hardware system business could be harmed we have simplified our supply chain process by reducing the number of third party manufacturing partner and the number of location where these third party manufacturer build our hardware system product we therefore have become more dependent on fewer number of these manufacturing partner and location if these partner experience production problem or delay or can not meet our demand for product we may not be able to find alternate manufacturing source in timely or cost effective manner if at all if we are required to change third party manufacturer our ability to meet our scheduled hardware system product delivery to our customer could be adversely affected which could cause the loss of sale and existing or potential customer delayed revenue recognition or an increase in our hardware system product expense all of which could adversely affect the margin of our hardware business we may experience foreign currency gain and loss we conduct significant number of transaction in currency other than the dollar change in the value of major foreign currency particularly the euro japanese yen and british pound relative to the dollar can significantly affect our revenue and operating result generally our revenue and operating result are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currency and are positively affected when the dollar weakens in addition we incur foreign currency transaction gain and loss primarily related to sublicense fee and other intercompany agreement among and our subsidiary that we expect to cash settle in the near term which are table of content charged against earnings in the period incurred we have program which primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contract to offset the risk associated with these foreign currency exposure that we may suspend from time to time part of this program we enter into foreign currency forward contract so that increase or decrease in our foreign currency exposure are offset by gain or loss on the foreign currency forward contract in order to mitigate the risk and volatility associated with our foreign currency transaction gain or loss large portion of our consolidated operation are international and we expect that we will continue to realize gain or loss with respect to our foreign currency exposure net of gain or loss from our foreign currency forward contract for example we will experience foreign currency gain and loss in certain instance if it is not possible or cost effective to hedge our foreign currency exposure or should we suspend our foreign currency forward contract program our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuation will generally depend on the size and type of cross currency exposure that we enter into the currency exchange rate associated with these exposure and change in those rate whether we have entered into foreign currency forward contract to offset these exposure and other factor all of these factor could materially impact our result of operation financial position and cash flow the timing of which is variable and generally outside of our control we may not be able to protect our intellectual property right we rely on copyright trademark patent and trade secret law confidentiality procedure control and contractual commitment to protect our intellectual property right despite our effort these protection may be limited unauthorized third party may try to copy or reverse engineer portion of our product or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property any patent owned by may be invalidated circumvented or challenged any of our pending or future patent application whether or not being currently challenged may not be issued with the scope of the claim we seek if at all in addition the law of some country do not provide the same level of protection of our intellectual property right do the law and court of the united state if we can not protect our intellectual property right against unauthorized copying or use or other misappropriation we may not remain competitive third party have claimed and in the future may claim infringement or misuse of intellectual property right and or breach of license agreement provision we periodically receive notice from or have lawsuit filed against by others claiming infringement or other misuse of their intellectual property right and or breach of our agreement with them these third party include entity that do not have the capability to design manufacture or distribute product or service or that acquire intellectual property like patent for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claim of infringement and misuse we expect the number of such claim will increase we continue to acquire company and expand into new business the number of product and competitor in our industry segment grows the use and support of third party code including open source code becomes more prevalent in the industry the volume of issued patent continues to increase and the proliferation of non practicing entity asserting intellectual property infringement claim increase responding to any such claim regardless of it validity could be time consuming costly and result in litigation divert management time and attention from developing our business require to pay monetary damage or enter into royalty and licensing agreement that we would not normally find acceptable require to stop selling or to redesign certain of our product require to release source code to third party possibly under open source license term require to satisfy indemnification obligation to our customer or otherwise adversely affect our business result of operation financial condition or cash flow table of content we may lose key employee or may be unable to hire enough qualified employee we rely on the continued service of our senior management including our chief executive officer and founder member of our executive team and other key employee and the hiring of new qualified employee in the technology industry there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business product development technical and other personnel in addition acquisition could cause to lose key personnel of the acquired company or at oracle we may also experience increased compensation cost that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher sale we may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel with rare exception we do not have long term employment or non competition agreement with our employee member of our senior management team have left oracle over the year for variety of reason and we can not assure you that there will not be additional departure which may be disruptive to our operation we continually focus on improving our cost structure by hiring personnel in country where advanced technical expertise is available at lower cost when we make adjustment to our workforce we may incur expense associated with workforce reduction that delay the benefit of more efficient workforce structure we may also experience increased competition for employee in these country the trend toward globalization continues which may affect our employee retention effort and increase our expense in an effort to offer competitive compensation program our compensation program includes stock option which are an important tool in attracting and retaining employee in our industry if our stock price performs poorly it may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract employee in addition because we expense all stock based compensation we may in the future change our stock based and other compensation practice some of the change we consider from time to time include reduction in the number of employee granted option reduction in the number of option granted per employee and change to alternative form of stock based compensation any change in our compensation practice or change made by competitor could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel our sale to government client subject to risk including early termination audit investigation sanction and penalty we derive revenue from contract with the government state and local government and their respective agency which may terminate most of these contract at any time without cause there is increased pressure for government and their agency both domestically and internationally to reduce spending our federal government contract are subject to the approval of appropriation being made by the congress to fund the expenditure under these contract similarly our contract at the state and local level are subject to government funding authorization additionally government contract are generally subject to audit and investigation which could result in various civil and criminal penalty and administrative sanction including termination of contract refund of portion of fee received forfeiture of profit suspension of payment fine and suspension or debarment from future government business we may need to change our pricing model to compete successfully the intense competition we face in the sale of our product and service and general economic and business condition can put pressure on to change our price if our competitor offer deep discount on certain product or service or develop product that the marketplace considers more valuable we may need to lower price or offer other favorable term in order to compete successfully any such change may reduce margin and could adversely affect operating result our software license update and product support fee and hardware system support fee are generally priced percentage of our net new software license fee and net new hardware system product fee respectively our competitor may offer lower pricing on their support offering which could put pressure on to further discount our new license price any broad based change to our price and pricing policy could cause our revenue to decline or be delayed our sale force implement and our customer adjust to the new pricing policy some of our competitor may bundle product for promotional purpose or long term pricing strategy or provide guarantee of price and product implementation these practice could over time significantly constrain the price that we can charge for certain of our product if we do not adapt our pricing model to reflect change in customer use of our product or change in customer demand our revenue could decrease additionally increased distribution of application through cloud and saas provider may reduce the average price for our product or adversely affect other sale of our product reducing our revenue unless we can offset price reduction with volume increase the increase in open source software distribution may also cause to change our pricing model table of content our cloud computing strategy including our oracle cloud and oracle managed cloud service offering may not be successful we offer customer broad portfolio of software and hardware product and service to enable roadmap for customer to adopt cloud computing oracle cloud includes our cloud software subscription offering such oracle fusion human capital management cloud service oracle fusion customer relationship management cloud service oracle rightnow customer experience and oracle taleo talent management cloud service among others all of which provide our customer with certain of our software application functionality within cloud based it environment that we manage and offer via subscription based model in addition oracle cloud also includes software platform within cloud based it environment that we manage and offer to customer via subscription based model including oracle database cloud service and oracle java cloud service oracle managed cloud service include software and hardware management and maintenance service hosted at our data center facility select partner data center or physically on premise at customer facility these business model continue to evolve and we may not be able to compete effectively generate significant revenue or maintain their profitability we incur expense associated with the infrastructure and marketing of our managed cloud service and cloud software subscription offering in advance of our ability to recognize the revenue associated with these offering demand for our cloud software subscription offering may unfavorably impact demand for certain of our other product and service including new software license and software license update and product support service if our data protection or other security measure are compromised and result our data our customer data or our it system are accessed improperly made unavailable or improperly modified our product and service may be perceived vulnerable our brand and reputation could be damaged the it service we provide to our customer could be disrupted and customer may stop using our product and service all of which could reduce our revenue and earnings increase our expense and expose to legal claim and regulatory action we are in the information technology business and our product and service store retrieve manipulate and manage our customer information and data well our own we have reputation for secure and reliable software and hardware product and service and have invested great deal of time and resource in protecting the integrity and security of our product service and internal and external data that we manage nevertheless computer hacker will attempt to penetrate or bypass our data protection and other security measure and gain unauthorized access to our network system and data or compromise the confidential information or data of our customer computer hacker may be able to develop and deploy it related virus worm and other malicious software program that could attack our product and service exploit potential security vulnerability of our product and service create system disruption and cause shutdown or denial of service data may also be accessed or modified improperly result of employee or supplier error or malfeasance and third party may attempt to fraudulently induce employee or customer into disclosing sensitive information such user name password or other information in order to gain access to our data our customer data or our it system although this is an industry wide problem that affect other software and hardware company it affect oracle in particular because computer hacker tend to focus their effort on the most popular or well known it company and they may focus on oracle because of our reputation for and marketing effort associated with having secure product and service these risk for will increase we continue to grow our cloud based offering and service and store and process increasingly large amount of our customer confidential information and data and host or manage part of our customer business in cloud based it environment especially in customer sector involving particularly sensitive data such health science financial service and the government we also have an active acquisition program and have acquired number of company product service and technology over the year while we make significant effort to address any it security issue with respect to our acquisition we may still inherit such risk when we integrate these acquisition within oracle if cyberattack or other security incident described above were to allow unauthorized access to or modification of our customer data or our own data or our it system or if the service we provide to our customer were disrupted or if our product or service are perceived having security vulnerability we could suffer damage to our brand and reputation customer could lose confidence in the security and reliability of our product and table of content service and perceive them to be not secure this in turn could lead to fewer customer using our product and service and result in reduced revenue and earnings the cost we would incur to address and fix these security incident would increase our expense these type of security incident could also lead to lawsuit regulatory investigation and claim and increased legal liability including in some case contractual cost related to customer notification and fraud monitoring further regulatory focus on privacy issue continues to increase and worldwide law and regulation concerning the protection of personal information expand and become more complex these potential risk to our business will intensify change in law or regulation associated with the protection of certain type of data such healthcare data or other personally identifiable information could greatly increase our cost of providing our product and service our periodic workforce restructurings can be disruptive we have in the past restructured or made other adjustment to our workforce including our direct sale force on which we rely heavily in response to management change product change performance issue acquisition and other internal and external consideration in the past sale force and other restructurings have generally resulted in temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity these effect could recur in connection with future acquisition and other restructurings and our revenue could be negatively affected we might experience significant error in our software and hardware product and service despite testing prior to their release software and hardware product sometimes contain error especially when first introduced or when new version are released the detection and correction of any error can be time consuming and costly error in our software or hardware product could affect the ability of our product to work with other software or hardware product could delay the development or release of new product or new version of product and could adversely affect market acceptance of our product if we experience error or delay in releasing our new software or hardware product or new version of our software or hardware product we could lose revenue in addition we run our own business operation cloud software subscription offering oracle managed cloud service and other outsourcing service support and consulting service on our product and network and any flaw if exploited could affect our ability to conduct our business operation end user who rely on our software product and service for application that are critical to their business may have greater sensitivity to product error than customer for software product generally error in our software and hardware product or service could expose to product liability performance and or warranty claim well harm our reputation which could impact our future sale of product and service we may not receive significant revenue from our current research and development effort for several year if at all developing software and hardware product is expensive and the investment in product development often involves long return on investment cycle we have made and expect to continue to make significant investment in research and development and related product opportunity accelerated product introduction and short product life cycle require high level of expenditure for research and development that could adversely affect our operating result if not offset by revenue increase we believe that we must continue to dedicate significant amount of resource to our research and development effort to maintain our competitive position however we do not expect to receive significant revenue from these investment for several year if at all business disruption could affect our operating result significant portion of our research and development activity and certain other critical business operation are concentrated in geographic area we are highly automated business and disruption or failure of our system could cause delay in completing sale and providing service including some of our cloud software subscription and managed cloud service offering major earthquake fire or other catastrophic event that result in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or it system could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operation and result our future operating result could be materially and adversely affected adverse litigation result could affect our business we are subject to various legal proceeding litigation can be lengthy expensive and disruptive to our operation and result can not be predicted with certainty an adverse decision could result in monetary damage or injunctive relief that could affect our business operating result or financial condition additional information regarding certain of the lawsuit we are involved in is discussed under note of note to consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report table of content we may have exposure to additional tax liability multinational corporation we are subject to income tax well non income based tax in both the united state and various foreign jurisdiction significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income tax and other tax liability we are regularly under audit by tax authority and those authority often do not agree with position taken by on our tax return change in tax law or tax ruling may have significantly adverse impact on our effective tax rate for example certain government proposal for fundamental international tax reform if enacted could have significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate further in the ordinary course of global business there are many intercompany transaction and calculation where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our intercompany transfer pricing is currently being reviewed by the internal revenue service irs and by foreign tax jurisdiction and will likely be subject to additional audit in the future we have negotiated certain unilateral advance pricing agreement with the irs and certain selected bilateral advance pricing agreement that cover many of our intercompany transfer pricing issue and preclude the relevant tax authority from making transfer pricing adjustment within the scope of these agreement however these agreement do not cover substantial element of our transfer pricing in addition our provision for income tax could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdiction which we consider to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united state that have lower statutory tax rate and earnings being higher than anticipated in jurisdiction that have higher statutory tax rate we are also subject to non income based tax such payroll sale use value added net worth property and good and service tax in both the united state and various foreign jurisdiction we are regularly under audit by tax authority with respect to these non income based tax and may have exposure to additional non income based tax liability our acquisition activity have increased our non income based tax exposure particularly with our entry into the hardware system business which increased the volume and complexity of law and regulation that we are subject to and with which we must comply although we believe that our income and non income based tax estimate are reasonable there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audit or tax dispute will not be different from is reflected in our historical income tax provision and accrual charge to earnings resulting from acquisition may adversely affect our operating result under business combination accounting standard pursuant to asc business combination we recognize the identifiable asset acquired the liability assumed and any non controlling interest in acquired company generally at their acquisition date fair value and in each case separately from goodwill goodwill of the acquisition date is measured the excess amount of consideration transferred which is also generally measured at fair value and the net of the acquisition date amount of the identifiable asset acquired and the liability assumed our estimate of fair value are based upon assumption believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain after we complete an acquisition the following factor could result in material charge and adversely affect our operating result and may adversely affect our cash flow cost incurred to combine the operation of company we acquire such transitional employee expense and employee retention redeployment or relocation expense impairment of goodwill or intangible asset amortization of intangible asset acquired reduction in the useful life of intangible asset acquired identification of or change to assumed contingent liability both income tax and non income tax related after our final determination of the amount for these contingency or the conclusion of the measurement period generally up to one year from the acquisition date whichever come first charge to our operating result to maintain certain duplicative pre merger activity for an extended period of time or to maintain these activity for period of time that is longer than we had anticipated charge to eliminate certain duplicative pre merger activity and charge to restructure our operation or to reduce our cost structure table of content charge to our operating result resulting from expense incurred to effect the acquisition and charge to our operating result due to the expensing of certain stock award assumed in an acquisition substantially all of these cost will be accounted for expense that will decrease our net income and earnings per share for the period in which those cost are incurred charge to our operating result in any given period could differ substantially from other period based on the timing and size of our future acquisition and the extent of integration activity more detailed discussion of our accounting for business combination and other item is presented in the critical accounting policy and estimate section of management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation item there are risk associated with our outstanding and future indebtedness of may we had an aggregate of billion of outstanding indebtedness that will mature between the remainder of calendar and calendar and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operation generate sufficient cash flow to service such debt and the other factor discussed in this section there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risk successfully we may also need to refinance portion of our outstanding debt it matures there is risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the term of any refinancing may not be favorable the term of our existing debt furthermore if prevailing interest rate or other factor at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rate upon refinancing then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase should we incur future increase in interest expense our ability to utilize certain of our foreign tax credit to reduce our federal income tax could be limited which could unfavorably affect our provision for income tax and effective tax rate in addition change by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value of both our debt and equity security and increase the interest amount we pay on outstanding or future debt these risk could adversely affect our financial condition and result of operation environmental law and regulation subject to number of risk and could result in significant liability and cost some of our hardware system operation are subject to state federal and international law governing protection of the environment proper handling and disposal of material used to manufacture our product human health and safety and regulating the use of certain chemical substance we endeavor to comply with these environmental law yet compliance with such law could increase our product design development procurement and manufacturing cost limit our ability to manage excess and obsolete non compliant inventory change our sale activity or otherwise impact future financial result of our hardware system business any violation of these law can subject to significant liability including fine penalty and possible prohibition of sale of our product into one or more state or country and result in material adverse effect on the financial condition or result of operation of our hardware system business significant portion of our hardware system revenue come from international sale environmental legislation within the european union eu including the eu directive on restriction of hazardous substance rohs and waste electrical and electronic equipment directive weee directive well china regulation on management method for controlling pollution caused by electronic information product may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our hardware system revenue from eu country and china we endeavor to comply with and implement these requirement in addition similar environmental legislation ha been or may be enacted in other jurisdiction the cumulative impact of which could be significant our stock price could become more volatile and investment could lose value all of the factor discussed in this section could affect our stock price the timing of announcement in the public market regarding new product product enhancement or technological advance by our competitor or and any announcement by of acquisition major transaction or management change could also affect our stock price change in the amount and frequency of share repurchase or dividend could adversely affect our stock price our stock price is subject to speculation in the press and the analyst community change in recommendation or earnings estimate by financial analyst change in investor or analyst valuation measure for our stock our credit rating and market trend unrelated to our performance significant drop in our stock price could also expose to the risk of security class action lawsuit which could result in substantial cost and divert management attention and resource which could adversely affect our business table of content

into new and emerging market we believe our ability to offer our customer choice and flexibility in the manner in which they deploy our product and service while maintaining enterprise grade reliability security and interoperability based upon industry standard is important to our corporate strategy oracle fusion application for example offer customer choice of deployment model to run our standard based software application in on premise or cloud computing it environment oracle cloud family of our cloud based software subscription offering provides access to select oracle software application and software platform on subscription basis in secure standard based cloud computing environment oracle cloud includes software application service such oracle fusion human capital management cloud service and oracle fusion customer relationship management cloud service and software platform service such oracle database cloud service and oracle java cloud service among others we believe our internal growth and continued innovation with respect to our software hardware and service business are the foundation of our long term strategic plan in each of fiscal and we invested billion and in fiscal we invested billion in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of product and service and to develop new product and service we continue to focus the engineering of our hardware and software product to make them work together more effectively and deliver improved computing performance reliability and security to our customer for example oracle engineered system which include our oracle exadata database machine oracle exalogic elastic cloud and sparc supercluster product amongst others combine certain of our hardware and software offering to provide engineered system that increase computing performance and reduce storage requirement relative to our competitor product creating time saving efficiency and operational cost advantage for our customer we also believe that an active acquisition program is an important element of our corporate strategy it strengthens our competitive position enhances the product and service that we can offer to customer expands our customer base provides greater scale to accelerate innovation grows our revenue and earnings and increase stockholder value in recent year we have invested billion of dollar to acquire number of company product service and technology that add to are complementary to or have otherwise enhanced our existing offering we expect to continue to acquire company product service and technology to further our corporate strategy table of content we are organized into three business software hardware system and service which are further divided into certain operating segment prior to our acquisition of sun microsystems inc sun in january we did not have hardware system business or related operating segment each of our business and operating segment ha unique characteristic and face different opportunity and challenge although we report our actual result in dollar we conduct significant number of transaction in currency other than dollar therefore we present constant currency information to provide framework for assessing how our underlying business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuation an overview of our three business and related operating segment follows software business our software business which represented and of our total revenue in fiscal and respectively is comprised of two operating segment new software license and software license update and product support on constant currency basis we expect that our software business total revenue generally will continue to increase due to continued demand for our software product and software license update and product support offering including the high percentage of customer that renew their software license update and product support contract and due to our acquisition which should allow to grow our profit and continue to make investment in research and development new software license we license our database and middleware well our application software and provide subscription based access to select oracle software application and software platform through cloud based it environment to business of many size government agency educational institution and resellers the growth in new software license revenue that we report is affected by the strength of general economic and business condition governmental budgetary constraint the competitive position of our software product our acquisition and foreign currency fluctuation the substantial majority of our new software license business is also characterized by long sale cycle the timing of few large software license transaction can substantially affect our quarterly new software license revenue since our new software license revenue in particular quarter can be difficult to predict result of the timing of few large software license transaction we believe that analysis of new software license revenue on trailing quarter period provided in our quarterly report on form provides additional visibility into the underlying performance of our new software license business new software license revenue represented and of our total revenue in fiscal and respectively the proportion of our new software license revenue relative to our total revenue wa affected by our entry into the hardware system business result of our acquisition of sun in the third quarter of fiscal our new software license segment margin have historically trended upward over the course of the four quarter within particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our new software license revenue over those quarterly period and because the majority of our cost for this segment are predominantly fixed in the short term however our new software license segment margin have been and will continue to be affected by fair value adjustment relating to the cloud software subscription obligation that we assumed in business combination described further below and by the amortization of intangible asset associated with company and technology that we have acquired we recorded adjustment to reduce obligation under our assumed cloud software subscription offering in business combination to their estimated fair value at the acquisition date result required by business combination accounting rule we did not recognize cloud software subscription revenue part of our new software license revenue that would have been otherwise recorded revenue by the acquired business independent entity in the amount of million in fiscal to the extent underlying cloud software subscription contract are renewed with following an acquisition we will recognize the revenue for the full value of the cloud software subscription contract over the contract period software license update and product support customer that purchase software license update and product support are granted right to unspecified product upgrade and maintenance release issued during the support period well technical support assistance substantially all of our customer renew their software license update and product support contract annually the growth of software license update and product support revenue is primarily influenced by three factor the percentage of our support contract customer base that renews it support contract the amount of new support contract sold in connection table of content with the sale of new software license and the amount of support contract assumed from company we have acquired software license update and product support revenue which represented and of our total revenue in fiscal and respectively is our highest margin business unit the proportion of our software license update and product support revenue relative to our total revenue wa affected by our entry into the hardware system business result of our acquisition of sun in the third quarter of fiscal margin during fiscal were and accounted for of our total margin over the same period our software license update and product support margin have been affected by fair value adjustment relating to software support obligation assumed in business combination described further below and by amortization of intangible asset however over the longer term we believe that software license update and product support revenue and margin will grow for the following reason substantially all of our customer including customer from acquired company renew their support contract when eligible for renewal substantially all of our customer purchase software license update and product support contract when they buy new software license resulting in further increase in our support contract base even if new software license revenue growth wa flat software license update and product support revenue would continue to grow in comparison to the corresponding prior year period assuming renewal and cancellation rate and foreign currency rate remained relatively constant since substantially all new software license transaction result in the sale of software license update and product support contract which add to our support contract base and our acquisition have increased our support contract base well the portfolio of product available to be licensed and supported we recorded adjustment to reduce support obligation assumed in business combination to their estimated fair value at the acquisition date result required by business combination accounting rule we did not recognize software license update and product support revenue related to software support contract that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired business independent entity in the amount of million million and million in fiscal and respectively to the extent underlying support contract are renewed with following an acquisition we will recognize the revenue for the full value of the support contract over the support period the majority of which are one year hardware system business our hardware system business consists of two operating segment hardware system product and hardware system support our hardware business represented and of our total revenue in fiscal and respectively we expect our hardware business to have lower operating margin percentage of revenue than our software business due to the incremental cost we incur to produce and distribute these product and to provide support service including direct material and labor cost we expect to make investment in research and development to improve existing hardware product and service and to develop new hardware product and service hardware system product we provide complete selection of hardware system and related service including server storage networking virtualization software operating system and management software to support diverse it environment including public and private cloud computing environment we engineer our hardware system with virtualization and management capability to enable the rapid deployment and efficient management of cloud infrastructure our hardware system product consist primarily of computer server storage and hardware related software including our oracle solaris operating system our hardware system component product are designed to be open or to work in customer environment that may include other oracle or non oracle hardware or software component we have also engineered our hardware system product to create performance and operational cost advantage for customer when our hardware and software product are combined oracle engineered system table of content our oracle engineered system include oracle exadata database machine oracle exalogic elastic cloud oracle exalytics in memory machine sparc supercluster oracle database appliance and the oracle big data appliance by combining our server and storage hardware with our software our open integrated product better address customer on premise and cloud computing requirement for performance scalability reliability security ease of management and lower total cost of ownership we offer wide range of server system using our sparc microprocessor our sparc server are differentiated by their reliability security scalability and customer environment that they target general purpose or specialized system our midsize and large server are designed to offer greater performance and lower total cost of ownership than mainframe system for business critical application and for customer having more computationally intensive need our sparc server run the oracle solaris operating system and are designed for the most demanding mission critical enterprise environment at any scale we also offer enterprise server these server are primarily based on microprocessor platform from intel corporation and are also compatible with oracle solaris oracle linux microsoft window and other operating system our netra line of server are aimed at the unique need of original equipment manufacturer oems and network equipment provider rack optimized system and our blade product offering combine high density hardware architecture and system management software that oems find particularly useful in building their own solution architecture our storage product are designed to securely manage protect archive and restore customer mission critical data asset and consist of tape disk hardware related software including file system software back up and archive software and storage management software and networking for mainframe and open system environment the majority of our hardware system product are sold through indirect channel including independent distributor and value added resellers to produce our hardware product we rely on both our internal manufacturing operation well third party manufacturing partner our internal manufacturing operation consist primarily of final assembly test and quality control of enterprise and data center server and storage system for all other manufacturing we rely on third party manufacturing partner we distribute most of our hardware product either from our facility or partner facility we strive to reduce cost by simplifying our manufacturing process through increased standardization of component across product type and build to order manufacturing process in which product generally are built only after customer have placed firm order in addition we seek to enhance hardware system support process that are designed to proactively identify and solve quality issue and to increase the amount of new hardware system support contract sold in connection with the sale of new hardware product our hardware system product revenue cost of hardware system product and operating margin that we report are affected by the strength of general economic and business condition governmental budgetary constraint our strategy for and the competitive position of our hardware system product our acquisition and foreign currency rate fluctuation in addition our operating margin for our hardware system product segment have been and will be affected by the amortization of intangible asset we have limited experience in predicting our quarterly hardware system product revenue the timing of customer order and delay in our ability to timely manufacture or deliver few large transaction could substantially affect the amount of hardware system product revenue expense and operating margin that we report hardware system support our hardware system support offering provide customer with software update for the software component that are essential to the functionality of our server and storage product such oracle solaris and can include product repair maintenance service and technical support service typically our hardware system support contract arrangement are invoiced to the customer at the beginning of the support period and are one year in duration our hardware system support revenue that we report are influenced by table of content number of factor including the volume of purchase of hardware product the mix of hardware product purchased and the percentage of our hardware system support contract customer base that renews it support contract all of these factor are heavily influenced by our customer decision to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware system infrastructure to newly developed technology that are available our hardware system support margin have been and will be affected by our acquisition and related accounting including fair value adjustment relating to hardware system support obligation assumed and by the amortization of intangible asset required by business combination accounting rule we recorded adjustment to reduce our hardware system support revenue for contract assumed from our acquisition to their estimated fair value these amount would have been recorded hardware system support revenue by the acquired business independent entity in the amount of million million and million for fiscal and respectively to the extent underlying hardware system support contract are renewed with following an acquisition we will recognize the revenue for the full value of the hardware system support contract over the support period service business our service business is comprised of the remainder of our operating segment and offer consulting service managed cloud service and education service our service business which represented of our total revenue in each of fiscal and and of our total revenue in fiscal ha lower margin than our software and hardware business the proportion of our service revenue relative to our total revenue wa affected by our entry into the hardware system business result of our acquisition of sun in the third quarter of fiscal our service revenue are impacted by certain of our acquisition general economic condition personnel reduction in our customer it department tighter control over discretionary spending and the growth in our software and hardware system product revenue our consulting line of business primarily provides service to customer in business and it strategy alignment enterprise architecture planning and design initial product implementation and integration and ongoing product enhancement and upgrade the amount of consulting revenue recognized tends to lag the amount of our software and hardware system product revenue by several quarter since consulting service if purchased are typically segmentable from the product with which they relate and are performed after the customer purchase of the product our service revenue they relate to consulting service are dependent upon general economic condition and the level of our product revenue in particular the new software license sale of our application product to the extent we are able to grow our product revenue in particular our software application product revenue we would also generally expect to be able to eventually grow our consulting revenue oracle managed cloud service provide comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance service including deployment management monitoring patching security and upgrade service for customer hosted at our oracle data center facility select partner data center or physically on premise at customer facility additionally we provide support service both on premise and remote to oracle customer to enable increased performance and higher availability of their product and service we believe that our managed cloud service offering provide our customer with greater value and choice through increased business performance reduced risk predictable cost and more flexibility in term of service in order to maximize the performance of their oracle software and hardware product and service education service provide training to customer partner and employee part of our mission to further the adoption and usage of our software and hardware product by our customer and create opportunity to grow our product revenue acquisition an active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy in recent year we have invested billion of dollar to acquire number of complementary company product service and technology including taleo corporation taleo and rightnow technology inc rightnow in fiscal table of content and art technology group inc atg and phase forward incorporated phase forward in fiscal among others we believe our acquisition program strengthens our competitive position enhances the product and service that we can offer to customer expands our customer base provides greater scale to accelerate innovation grows our revenue and earnings and increase stockholder value we expect to continue to acquire company product service and technology in furtherance of our corporate strategy note of note to consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report provides additional information related to our recent acquisition we believe we can fund our future acquisition with our internally available cash cash equivalent and marketable security cash generated from operation additional borrowing or from the issuance of additional security we estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings operating margin cash flow and return on invested capital target before deciding to move forward with an acquisition critical accounting policy and estimate our consolidated financial statement are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle gaap set forth in the financial accounting standard board fasb accounting standard codification codification and consider the various staff accounting bulletin and other applicable guidance issued by the sec gaap set forth within the codification requires to make certain estimate judgment and assumption we believe that the estimate judgment and assumption upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to at the time that these estimate judgment and assumption are made these estimate judgment and assumption can affect the reported amount of asset and liability of the date of the financial statement well the reported amount of revenue and expense during the period presented to the extent there are difference between these estimate judgment or assumption and actual result our financial statement will be affected the accounting policy that reflect our more significant estimate judgment and assumption and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial result include the following revenue recognition business combination goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessment accounting for income tax legal and other contingency stock based compensation allowance for doubtful account in many case the accounting treatment of particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and doe not require management judgment in it application there are also area in which management judgment in selecting among available alternative would not produce materially different result our senior management ha reviewed the below critical accounting policy and related disclosure with the finance and audit committee of the board of director revenue recognition our source of revenue include software which includes new software license revenue earned from granting license to use our software product and fee from cloud software subscription offering and software license update and product support revenue hardware system which includes the sale of hardware system product including computer server and storage product and hardware system support revenue and service which includes software and hardware related service including consulting managed cloud service and education revenue revenue generally is recognized net of any tax collected from customer and subsequently remitted to governmental authority table of content revenue recognition for software product and software related service software element new software license revenue primarily represent fee earned from granting customer license to use our database middleware and application software and exclude revenue derived from software license update which are included in software license update and product support revenue the basis for our new software license revenue recognition is substantially governed by the accounting guidance contained in asc software revenue recognition we exercise judgment and use estimate in connection with the determination of the amount of software and service revenue to be recognized in each accounting period for software license arrangement that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software we recognize new software license revenue when we enter into legally binding arrangement with customer for the license of software we deliver the product the sale price is fixed or determinable and free of contingency or significant uncertainty and collection is probable revenue that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing condition are not met are recognized when those condition are subsequently met substantially all of our software license arrangement do not include acceptance provision however if acceptance provision exist part of public policy for example in agreement with government entity where acceptance period are required by law or within previously executed term and condition that are referenced in the current agreement and are short term in nature we generally recognize revenue upon delivery provided the acceptance term are perfunctory and all other revenue recognition criterion have been met if acceptance provision are not perfunctory for example acceptance provision that are long term in nature or are not included standard term of an arrangement revenue are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period the vast majority of our software license arrangement include software license update and product support contract which are entered into at the customer option and are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement typically one year software license update provide customer with right to unspecified software product upgrade maintenance release and patch released during the term of the support period product support includes internet access to technical content well internet and telephone access to technical support personnel software license update and product support contract are generally priced percentage of the net new software license fee substantially all of our customer renew their software license update and product support contract annually revenue recognition for multiple element arrangement software product and software related service software arrangement we often enter into arrangement with customer that purchase both software related product and software related service from at the same time or within close proximity of one another referred to software related multiple element arrangement such software related multiple element arrangement include the sale of our software product software license update and product support contract and other software related service whereby software license delivery is followed by the subsequent or contemporaneous delivery of the other element for those software related multiple element arrangement we have applied the residual method to determine the amount of software license revenue to be recognized pursuant to asc under the residual method if fair value exists for undelivered element in multiple element arrangement such fair value of the undelivered element is deferred with the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration recognized upon delivery of the software license or service arrangement we allocate the fair value of each element of software related multiple element arrangement based upon it fair value determined by our vendor specific objective evidence vsoe described further below with any remaining amount allocated to the software license revenue recognition for hardware system product hardware system related service and cloud software subscription offering nonsoftware element revenue from the sale of hardware system product represent amount earned primarily from the sale of computer server and storage product our revenue recognition policy for these nonsoftware deliverable and table of content other nonsoftware deliverable including hardware system related service and cloud software subscription offering is based upon the accounting guidance contained in asc revenue recognition and we exercise judgment and use estimate in connection with the determination of the amount of hardware system product hardware system related service revenue and cloud software subscription revenue to be recognized in each accounting period revenue from the sale of our nonsoftware element are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we deliver the product and passage of the title to the buyer occurs the sale price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured revenue that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing condition are not met are recognized when those condition are subsequently met when applicable we reduce revenue for estimated return or certain other incentive program where we have the ability to sufficiently estimate the effect of these item where an arrangement is subject to acceptance criterion and the acceptance provision are not perfunctory for example acceptance provision that are long term in nature or are not included standard term of an arrangement revenue are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period our hardware system support offering generally provide customer with software update for the software component that are essential to the functionality of our server and storage product and can also include product repair maintenance service and technical support service hardware system support contract are generally priced percentage of the net hardware system product fee hardware system support contract are entered into at the customer option and are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangement which are typically one year our cloud software subscription offering generally provide customer access to certain of our software within cloud based it environment that we manage and offer to customer on subscription basis revenue for our cloud software subscription offering are recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date our service is made available to customer and all other revenue recognition criterion have been satisfied revenue recognition for multiple element arrangement hardware system product and hardware system related service nonsoftware arrangement we enter into arrangement with customer that purchase both nonsoftware related product and service from at the same time or within close proximity of one another referred to nonsoftware multiple element arrangement each element within nonsoftware multiple element arrangement is accounted for separate unit of accounting provided the following criterion are met the delivered product or service have value to the customer on standalone basis and for an arrangement that includes general right of return relative to the delivered product or service delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by we consider deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by or another vendor or could be resold by the customer further our revenue arrangement generally do not include general right of return relative to the delivered product where the aforementioned criterion for separate unit of accounting are not met the deliverable is combined with the undelivered element and treated single unit of accounting for the purpose of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition for those unit of accounting that include more than one deliverable but are treated single unit of accounting we generally recognize revenue over the delivery period for the purpose of revenue classification of the element that are accounted for single unit of accounting we allocate revenue to the respective revenue line item within our consolidated statement of operation based on rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of relative selling price of such element for our nonsoftware multiple element arrangement we allocate revenue to each element based on selling price hierarchy at the arrangement inception the selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy vsoe if available third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe are available description to how we determine vsoe tpe and esp is provided below if tangible hardware system product includes software we determine whether the tangible hardware system product and the software work together to deliver the product essential functionality and if table of content so the entire product is treated nonsoftware deliverable the total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the nonsoftware deliverable using the relative selling price of each unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy we limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered element to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional product or service or meeting of any specified performance condition when possible we establish vsoe of selling price for deliverable in nonsoftware multiple element arrangement using the price charged for deliverable when sold separately and for software license update and product support and hardware system support based on the renewal rate offered to customer tpe is established by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor product or service in standalone arrangement with similarly situated customer if we are unable to determine the selling price because vsoe or tpe doe not exist we determine esp for the purpose of allocating the arrangement by reviewing historical transaction including transaction whereby the deliverable wa sold on standalone basis and considering several other external and internal factor including but not limited to pricing practice including discounting margin objective competition the geography in which we offer our product and service the type of customer distributor value added reseller government agency and direct end user among others and the stage of the product lifecycle the determination of esp is made through consultation with and approval by our management taking into consideration our pricing model and go to market strategy our or our competitor pricing and go to market strategy evolve we may modify our pricing practice in the future which could result in change to our determination of vsoe tpe and esp result our future revenue recognition for multiple element arrangement could differ materially from our result in the current period selling price are analyzed on an annual basis or more frequently if we experience significant change in our selling price revenue recognition policy applicable to both software and nonsoftware element revenue recognition for multiple element arrangement arrangement with software and nonsoftware element we also enter into multiple element arrangement that may include combination of our various software related and nonsoftware related product and service offering including hardware system product hardware system support new software license software license update and product support cloud software subscription consulting managed cloud service and education in such arrangement we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of the software group of element whole and to the nonsoftware element we then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective element within that group following the guidance in asc and our policy described above after the arrangement consideration ha been allocated to the element we account for each respective element in the arrangement described above other revenue recognition policy applicable to software and nonsoftware element many of our software arrangement include consulting implementation service sold separately under consulting engagement contract and are included part of our service business consulting revenue from these arrangement are generally accounted for separately from new software license revenue because the arrangement qualify service transaction defined in asc the more significant factor considered in determining whether the revenue should be accounted for separately include the nature of service consideration of whether the service are essential to the functionality of the licensed product degree of risk availability of service from other vendor timing of payment and impact of milestone or acceptance criterion on the realizability of the software license fee revenue for consulting service are generally recognized the service are performed if there is significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting service revenue are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved we estimate the proportional performance on contract with fixed or not to exceed fee on monthly basis utilizing hour incurred to date percentage of total estimated hour to complete the project if we do not have sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion revenue are recognized when we receive final acceptance from the customer that the service have been completed when total cost estimate exceed revenue we accrue for the estimated loss immediately using cost estimate that are based upon an average fully table of content burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the service the complexity of the estimation process and factor relating to the assumption risk and uncertainty inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affect the amount of revenue and related expense reported in our consolidated financial statement number of internal and external factor can affect our estimate including labor rate utilization and efficiency variance and specification and testing requirement change our managed cloud service are offered standalone arrangement or part of arrangement to customer buying new software license or hardware system product and service oracle managed cloud service are designed to provide comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance service for customer hosted at our oracle data center facility select partner data center or physically on premise at customer facility additionally we provide support service both on premise and remote to oracle customer to enable increased performance and higher availability of their product and service depending upon the nature of the arrangement revenue from managed cloud service are recognized service are performed or ratably over the term of the service period which is generally one year or le education revenue are also part of our service business and include instructor led medium based and internet based training in the use of our software and hardware product education revenue are recognized the class or other education offering are delivered if an arrangement contains multiple element and doe not qualify for separate accounting for the product and service transaction then new software license revenue and or hardware system product revenue including the cost of hardware system product are generally recognized together with the service based on contract accounting using either the percentage of completion or completed contract method contract accounting is applied to any bundled software hardware system and service arrangement that include milestone or customer specific acceptance criterion that may affect collection of the software license or hardware system product fee where consulting service include significant modification or customization of the software or hardware system product or are of specialized nature and generally performed only by oracle where significant consulting service are provided for in the software license contract or hardware system product contract without additional charge or are substantially discounted or where the software license or hardware system product payment is tied to the performance of consulting service for the purpose of revenue classification of the element that are accounted for single unit of accounting we allocate revenue to software and nonsoftware element based on rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of the relative selling price of such element we also evaluate arrangement with governmental entity containing fiscal funding or termination for convenience provision when such provision are required by law to determine the probability of possible cancellation we consider multiple factor including the history with the customer in similar transaction the essential use of the software or hardware system product and the planning budgeting and approval process undertaken by the governmental entity if we determine upon execution of these arrangement that the likelihood of cancellation is remote we then recognize revenue once all of the criterion described above have been met if such determination can not be made revenue are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity we ass whether fee are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenue if all other revenue recognition requirement are met our standard payment term are net day however payment term may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed payment that are due within six month are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on our successful collection history on such arrangement and thereby satisfy the required criterion for revenue recognition while most of our arrangement for sale within our business include short term payment term we have standard practice of providing long term financing to creditworthy customer through our financing division since fiscal when our financing division wa formed we have established history of collection without concession on these receivables with payment term that generally extend up to five year from the contract date provided all other revenue recognition criterion have been met we recognize new software license revenue and hardware system product revenue for these arrangement upon delivery net of any payment discount table of content from financing transaction we have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on non recourse basis to third party financing institution within day of the contract date of execution and we classify the proceeds from these sale cash flow from operating activity in our consolidated statement of cash flow we account for the sale of these receivables true sale defined in asc transfer and servicing we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables in addition we enter into arrangement with leasing company for the sale of our hardware system product these leasing company in turn lease our product to end user the leasing company generally have no recourse to in the event of default by the end user and we recognize revenue upon delivery if all the other revenue recognition criterion have been met our customer include several of our supplier and occasionally we have purchased good or service for our operation from these vendor at or about the same time that we have sold our product to these same company concurrent transaction software license agreement or sale of hardware system that occur within three month time period from the date we have purchased good or service from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure when we acquire good or service from customer we negotiate the purchase separately from any sale transaction at term we consider to be at arm length and settle the purchase in cash we recognize new software license revenue or hardware system product revenue from concurrent transaction if all of our revenue recognition criterion are met and the good and service acquired are necessary for our current operation business combination we apply the provision of asc business combination in the accounting for our acquisition it requires to recognize separately from goodwill the asset acquired and the liability assumed at their acquisition date fair value goodwill of the acquisition date is measured the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition date fair value of the asset acquired and the liability assumed while we use our best estimate and assumption to accurately value asset acquired and liability assumed at the acquisition date our estimate are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we record adjustment to the asset acquired and liability assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the value of asset acquired or liability assumed whichever come first any subsequent adjustment are recorded to our consolidated statement of operation accounting for business combination requires our management to make significant estimate and assumption especially at the acquisition date including our estimate for intangible asset contractual obligation assumed restructuring liability pre acquisition contingency and contingent consideration where applicable although we believe the assumption and estimate we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired company and are inherently uncertain example of critical estimate in valuing certain of the intangible asset we have acquired include but are not limited to future expected cash flow from software license sale hardware system product sale support agreement consulting contract other customer contract acquired developed technology and patent expected cost to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable product and estimated cash flow from the project when completed the acquired company brand and competitive position well assumption about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company product portfolio and discount rate unanticipated event and circumstance may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumption estimate or actual result table of content we estimate the fair value of cloud software subscription software license update and product support and hardware system support obligation assumed the estimated fair value of these performance obligation are determined utilizing cost build up approach the cost build up approach determines fair value by estimating the cost related to fulfilling the obligation plus normal profit margin the estimated cost to fulfill the obligation are based on the historical direct cost related to providing the service including the correction of any error in the product acquired the sum of these cost and operating profit approximates in theory the amount that we would be required to pay third party to assume the performance obligation we do not include any cost associated with selling effort or research and development or the related fulfillment margin on these cost profit associated with any selling effort is excluded because the acquired entity would have concluded those selling effort on the performance obligation prior to the acquisition date we also do not include the estimated research and development cost in our fair value determination these cost are not deemed to represent legal obligation at the time of acquisition result we did not recognize new software license revenue related to cloud software subscription contract in the amount of million that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired business independent entity in fiscal we did not recognize software license update and product support revenue related to support contract in the amount of million million and million that would have been otherwise recorded by the acquired business independent entity in fiscal and respectively in addition we did not recognize hardware system support revenue related to hardware system support contract that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired business independent entity in the amount of million million and million for fiscal and respectively historically substantially all of our customer including customer from acquired company renew their software license update and product support contract when the contract are eligible for renewal and we strive to renew cloud software subscription and hardware system support contract to the extent cloud software subscription software support or hardware system support contract are renewed we will recognize the revenue for the full value of the contract over the contract period which are generally one year in duration in connection with business combination we estimate cost associated with restructuring plan committed to by our management restructuring cost are typically comprised of employee severance cost cost of consolidating duplicate facility and contract termination cost restructuring expense are based upon plan that have been committed to by our management but may be refined in subsequent period we account for cost to exit or restructure certain activity of an acquired company separately from the business combination these cost are accounted for one time termination and exit cost pursuant to asc exit or disposal cost obligation liability for cost associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at it fair value in our consolidated statement of operation in the period in which the liability is incurred when estimating the fair value of facility restructuring activity assumption are applied regarding estimated sub lease payment to be received which can differ materially from actual result this may require to revise our initial estimate which may materially affect our result of operation and financial position in the period the revision is made for given acquisition we may identify certain pre acquisition contingency of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre acquisition contingency throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to ass whether we include these contingency part of the fair value estimate of asset acquired and liability assumed and if so to determine their estimated amount if we can not reasonably determine the fair value of pre acquisition contingency non income tax related by the end of the measurement period which is generally the case given the nature of such matter we will recognize an asset or liability for such pre acquisition contingency if it is probable that an asset existed or liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and ii the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated subsequent to the measurement period change in our estimate of such contingency will affect earnings and could have material effect on our result of operation and financial position in addition uncertain tax position and tax related valuation allowance assumed in connection with business combination are initially estimated of the acquisition date we reevaluate these item quarterly based upon fact and circumstance that existed of the acquisition date with any adjustment to our preliminary estimate being recorded to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance or contingency estimated value whichever come first table of content change to these uncertain tax position and tax related valuation allowance will affect our provision for income tax in our consolidated statement of operation and could have material impact on our result of operation and financial position goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessment we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever event or change in circumstance indicate it carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with asc intangible goodwill and other effective fiscal we opted to perform qualitative assessment to test reporting unit goodwill for impairment based on our qualitative assessment if we determine that the fair value of reporting unit is more likely than not likelihood of more than percent to be le than it carrying amount the two step impairment test will be performed in the first step we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to it carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net asset assigned to that unit goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing if the carrying value of the net asset assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill if the carrying value of reporting unit goodwill exceeds it implied fair value then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference our reporting unit are consistent with our operating segment identified in note of note to consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report determining the fair value of reporting unit involves the use of significant estimate and assumption these estimate and assumption include revenue growth rate and operating margin used to calculate projected future cash flow risk adjusted discount rate future economic and market condition and determination of appropriate market comparables we base our fair value estimate on assumption we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future result may differ from those estimate in addition we make certain judgment and assumption in allocating shared asset and liability to determine the carrying value for each of our reporting unit our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis which wa performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal did not result in goodwill impairment charge nor did we record any goodwill impairment in fiscal or we make judgment about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible asset whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that an impairment may exist each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful life of purchased intangible asset and whether event or change in circumstance warrant revision to the remaining period of amortization recoverability of finite lived intangible asset is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flow the asset is expected to generate we review indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment annually and whenever event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable recoverability of indefinite lived intangible asset is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to it fair value if the asset is considered to be impaired the amount of any impairment is measured the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset assumption and estimate about future value and remaining useful life of our intangible and other long lived asset are complex and subjective they can be affected by variety of factor including external factor such industry and economic trend and internal factor such change in our business strategy and our internal forecast although we believe the historical assumption and estimate we have made are reasonable and appropriate different assumption and estimate could materially impact our reported financial result we did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charge in fiscal or accounting for income tax significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision in the ordinary course of global business there are many transaction and calculation where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain some of these uncertainty arise consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangement among related entity the process of identifying item of revenue and expense that qualify for preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expense to avoid double taxation although we table of content believe that our estimate are reasonable the final tax outcome of these matter could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provision and accrual such difference could have material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no tax have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united state remittance of foreign earnings to the united state are planned based on projected cash flow working capital and investment need of our foreign and domestic operation based on these assumption we estimate the amount that will be distributed to the united state and provide federal tax on these amount material change in our estimate to how much of our foreign earnings will be distributed to the united state or tax legislation that limit or restricts the amount of undistributed foreign earnings that we consider indefinitely reinvested outside the united state could materially impact our income tax provision and effective tax rate we record valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized in order for to realize our deferred tax asset we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdiction where the deferred tax asset are located we consider future growth forecasted earnings future taxable income the mix of earnings in the jurisdiction in which we operate historical earnings taxable income in prior year if carryback is permitted under the law and prudent and feasible tax planning strategy in determining the need for valuation allowance in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset would be realized we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance an adjustment to earnings at such time we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimate and assumption that could differ from the actual result reflected in income tax return filed during the subsequent year adjustment based on filed return are generally recorded in the period when the tax return are filed and the global tax implication are known which can materially impact our effective tax rate the amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audit by federal state and foreign tax authority which often result in proposed assessment our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental description of our accounting policy associated with tax related contingency assumed part of business combination is provided under business combination above for those tax related contingency that are not part of business combination we account for these uncertain tax issue pursuant to asc income tax which contains two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in tax return the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit including resolution of any related appeal or litigation process the second step is to measure the tax benefit the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax position no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matter we adjust reserve for our uncertain tax position due to changing fact and circumstance such the closing of tax audit judicial ruling refinement of estimate or realization of earnings or deduction that differ from our estimate to the extent that the final outcome of these matter is different than the amount recorded such difference generally will impact our provision for income tax in the period in which such determination is made our provision for income tax include the impact of reserve provision and change to reserve that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalty in addition part of our accounting for business combination intangible asset are recognized at fair value and goodwill is measured the excess of consideration transferred over the net estimated fair value of asset acquired impairment charge associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the period that any impairment is recorded amortization expense associated with acquired intangible asset are generally not tax deductible pursuant to our existing tax structure however deferred tax have been recorded for non deductible amortization expense part of the accounting for business combination we have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangible among different taxing jurisdiction including those with nominal or zero percent tax rate in establishing the related deferred tax liability table of content legal and other contingency we are currently involved in various claim and legal proceeding quarterly we review the status of each significant matter and ass our potential financial exposure description of our accounting policy associated with contingency assumed part of business combination is provided under business combination above for legal and other contingency that are not part of business combination we accrue liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination to whether the amount of an exposure is reasonably estimable because of uncertainty related to these matter accrual are based only on the best information available at the time the accrual are made additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claim and litigation and may revise our estimate such revision in the estimate of the potential liability could have material impact on our result of operation and financial position stock based compensation we account for share based payment to employee including grant of employee stock option restricted stock based award and purchase under employee stock purchase plan in accordance with asc compensation stock compensation which requires that share based payment to the extent they are compensatory be recognized in our consolidated statement of operation based on their fair value we recognize stock based compensation expense on straight line basis over the service period of the award which is generally four year we are required to estimate the stock award that we ultimately expect to vest and to reduce stock based compensation expense for the effect of estimated forfeiture of award over the expense recognition period although we estimate the rate of future forfeiture based upon historical experience actual forfeiture in the future may differ to the extent our actual forfeiture are different than our estimate we record true up for the difference in the period that the award vest and such true ups could materially affect our operating result additionally we also consider on quarterly basis whether there have been any significant change in fact and circumstance that would affect our expected forfeiture rate we estimate the fair value of employee stock option using black scholes merton valuation model the fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant well other assumption including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the award and the estimated period of time that we expect employee to hold their stock option the risk free interest rate assumption we use is based upon united state treasury interest rate appropriate for the expected life of the award we use the implied volatility of our publicly traded option in order to estimate future stock price trend we believe that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trend than historical volatility in order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employee to hold their stock option we have used historical rate of employee group by seniority of job classification our expected dividend rate is based upon an annualized dividend yield based on the per share dividend declared by our board of director the aforementioned input entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock award are subjective estimate and change to these estimate will cause the fair value of our stock award and related stock based compensation expense that we record to vary we record deferred tax asset for stock based compensation award that result in deduction on our income tax return based on the amount of stock based compensation recognized and the fair value attributable to the vested portion of stock award assumed in connection with business combination at the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive tax deduction because the deferred tax asset we record are based upon the stock based compensation expense in particular jurisdiction the aforementioned input that affect the fair value of our stock award may also indirectly affect our income tax expense in addition difference between the deferred tax asset recognized for financial reporting purpose and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax return are recorded in additional paid in capital if the tax deduction is le than the deferred tax asset the calculated shortfall reduces our pool of excess tax benefit if the pool of excess tax benefit is reduced to zero then subsequent shortfall would increase our income tax expense table of content to the extent we change the term of our employee stock based compensation program experience market volatility in the pricing of our common stock that increase the implied volatility calculation of our publicly traded option refine different assumption in future period such forfeiture rate that differ from our current estimate or assume stock award from acquired company that are different in nature than our stock award arrangement among other potential impact the stock based compensation expense that we record in future period and the tax benefit that we realize may differ significantly from what we have recorded in previous reporting period allowance for doubtful account we make judgment to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowance for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful provision are made based upon specific review of all significant outstanding invoice for those invoice not specifically reviewed provision are provided at differing rate based upon the age of the receivable the collection history associated with the geographic region that the receivable wa recorded and current economic trend if the historical data that we use to calculate the allowance for doubtful account doe not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables additional provision for doubtful account may be needed and our future result of operation could be materially affected result of operation impact of acquisition the comparability of our operating result in fiscal compared to fiscal is impacted by our acquisition primarily the acquisition of taleo in the fourth quarter of fiscal rightnow in the third quarter of fiscal atg in the third quarter of fiscal and phase forward during the first quarter of fiscal the comparability of our operating result in fiscal compared to fiscal is impacted by our acquisition primarily the acquisition of sun in the third quarter of fiscal and to lesser extent our acquisition of atg in the third quarter of fiscal and phase forward during the first quarter of fiscal in our discussion of change in our result of operation from fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal we quantify the contribution of our acquired product to the growth in new software license revenue software license update and product support revenue hardware system product revenue applicable and hardware system support revenue applicable for the one year period subsequent to the acquisition date we also are able to quantify the total incremental expense associated with our hardware system product and hardware system support operating segment for fiscal in comparison to fiscal the incremental contribution of our acquisition to our other business and operating segment revenue and expense are not provided they either were not separately identifiable due to the integration of these operating segment into our existing operation and or were insignificant to our result of operation during the period presented we caution reader that while pre and post acquisition comparison well the quantified amount may provide indication of general trend the acquisition information that we provide ha inherent limitation for the following reason the quantification can not address the substantial effect attributable to change in business strategy including our sale force integration effort we believe that if our acquired company had operated independently and sale force had not been integrated the relative mix of product sold would have been different and although substantially all of our customer including customer from acquired company renew their software license update and product support contract when the contract are eligible for renewal and we strive to renew cloud software subscription contract and hardware system support contract the amount shown software license update and product support deferred revenue new software license deferred revenue and hardware system support deferred revenue in our supplemental disclosure related to certain charge presented below are not necessarily indicative of revenue improvement we will achieve upon contract renewal to the extent customer do not renew table of content constant currency presentation our international operation have provided and will continue to provide significant portion of our total revenue and expense result total revenue and expense will continue to be affected by change in the dollar against major international currency in order to provide framework for assessing how our underlying business performed excluding the effect of

and comparative prior period result for entity reporting in currency other than dollar are converted into dollar at constant exchange rate the rate in effect on may which wa the last day of our prior fiscal year rather than the actual exchange rate in effect during the respective period for example if an entity reporting in euro had revenue of million euro from product sold on may and may our financial statement would reflect reported revenue of million in fiscal using the month end average exchange rate for the period and million in fiscal using the month end average exchange rate for the period the constant currency presentation would translate the fiscal result using the fiscal exchange rate and indicate in this example no change in revenue during the period in each of the table

growth in our software business revenue partially offset by reduction in our hardware system business revenue excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuation the america contributed emea contributed and asia pacific contributed to our total revenue growth table of content excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuation total operating expense decreased slightly in fiscal primarily due to reduction in our hardware system business expense due to efficiency gained through our hardware system support integration effort and lower hardware system product cost associated with lower hardware system product revenue due to decrease in certain variable compensation expense and due to reduction in restructuring cost and acquisition related cost primarily associated with expense incurred in fiscal related to our acquisition of sun these fiscal expense decrease were partially offset by fiscal expense increase in salary and benefit primarily related to additional sale and marketing headcount and an increase in general and administrative expense that wa due to million legal expense recovery in fiscal excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuation the increase in total operating margin and operating margin percentage of revenue in fiscal wa due to our increase in revenue while our expense decreased fiscal compared to fiscal our total revenue increased in fiscal due to billion of incremental revenue contribution from our hardware system business and significant increase in our software and service business revenue our total revenue growth across all of our business in fiscal wa favorably affected by full year of revenue contribution from sun compared to our fiscal operating result for which sun revenue contribution were limited to only portion of the fiscal period in addition our software business revenue increased result of the growth in our new software license revenue and our software license update and product support revenue excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuation the america contributed emea contributed and apac contributed to our total revenue growth excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuation the increase in total operating expense in fiscal wa due to full year of expense contribution from sun to our fiscal operating result including increased expense pertaining to hardware system product sold and related hardware system support offering additional employee related expense and an increase in intangible asset amortization these increase were partially offset by reduction in restructuring expense relating to our sun restructuring plan and certain other oracle based restructuring plan and were also favorably affected by the recovery of certain legal cost in fiscal noted above on constant currency basis our operating margin increased during fiscal due to our total revenue growth our operating margin percentage of revenue remained flat in fiscal our revenue and expense grew at

by gain or loss on the foreign currency forward contract in order to mitigate the risk and volatility associated with our foreign currency transaction we may suspend this program from time to time our foreign currency exposure typically arise from intercompany sublicense fee intercompany loan and other intercompany transaction that are expected to be cash settled in the near term our foreign currency forward contract are generally short term in duration we neither use these foreign currency forward contract for trading purpose nor do we designate these forward contract hedging instrument pursuant to asc accordingly we record the fair value of these contract of the end of our reporting period to our consolidated balance sheet with change in fair value recorded to our consolidated

liability for net unrealized loss position the statement of operation classification for change in fair value of these forward contract is non operating income expense net for both realized and unrealized gain and loss we expect that we will continue to realize gain or loss with respect to our foreign currency exposure net of gain or loss from our foreign currency forward contract our

generally used to manage and automate business process and to provide business intelligence we also offer software license update and product support contract that provide our customer with right to unspecified product upgrade and maintenance release issued during the support period well technical support assistance on january we completed our acquisition of sun microsystems inc sun provider of hardware system software and service by mean of merger of one of our wholly owned subsidiary with and into sun such that sun became wholly owned subsidiary of oracle result of our acquisition of sun we entered into new hardware system business our hardware system business consists of two operating segment hardware system product which consists primarily of computer server and storage product offering and hardware system support which provides customer with unspecified software update for the software component that are essential to the functionality of our hardware system and storage product and can include product repair maintenance service and technical support service in addition we enhanced our existing software and service business with additional offering from sun our acquisition of sun added significant amount of revenue and expense to our result of operation in comparison to our historical operating result basis of financial statement the consolidated financial

consolidated equity from the equity attributable to oracle stockholder for all period presented the noncontrolling interest in our net income were not significant to our consolidated result for the

assumption are made these estimate judgment and assumption can affect the reported amount of asset and liability of the date of the financial statement well the reported amount of revenue and expense during the period presented to the extent there are difference between these estimate judgment or assumption and actual result our consolidated financial statement will be affected in many case the table of content oracle corporation note to consolidated financial statement continued may accounting treatment of particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and doe not require management judgment in it application there are also area in which management judgment in selecting among available alternative would not produce materially different result revenue recognition our source of revenue include software which includes new software license revenue earned from granting license to use our software product and fee from cloud software subscription offering and software license update and product support revenue hardware system which includes the sale of hardware system product including computer server and storage product and hardware system support revenue and service which includes software and hardware related service including consulting managed cloud service and education revenue revenue generally is recognized net of any tax collected from customer and subsequently remitted to governmental authority revenue recognition for software product and software related service software element new software license revenue primarily represent fee earned from granting customer license to use our database middleware and application software and exclude revenue derived from software license update which are included in software license update and product support revenue the basis for our new software license revenue recognition is substantially governed by the accounting guidance contained in asc software revenue recognition we exercise judgment and use estimate in connection with the determination of the amount of software and service revenue to be recognized in each accounting period for software license arrangement that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software we recognize new software license revenue when we enter into legally binding arrangement with customer for the license of software we deliver the product the sale price is fixed or determinable and free of contingency or significant uncertainty and collection is probable revenue that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing condition are not met are recognized when those condition are subsequently met substantially all of our software license arrangement do not include acceptance provision however if acceptance provision exist part of public policy for example in agreement with government entity where acceptance period are required by law or within previously executed term and condition that are referenced in the current agreement and are short term in nature we generally recognize revenue upon delivery provided the acceptance term are perfunctory and all other revenue recognition criterion have been met if acceptance provision are not perfunctory for example acceptance provision that are long term in nature or are not included standard term of an arrangement revenue are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period the vast majority of our software license arrangement include software license update and product support contract which are entered into at the customer option and are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement typically one year software license update provide customer with right to unspecified software product upgrade maintenance release and patch released during the term of the support period product support includes internet access to technical content well internet and telephone access to technical support personnel software license update and product support contract are generally priced percentage of the net new software license fee substantially all of our customer renew their software license update and product support contract annually revenue recognition for multiple element arrangement software product and software related service software arrangement we often enter into arrangement with customer that purchase both software related product and software related service from at the same time or within close proximity of one another referred to software related table of content oracle corporation note to consolidated financial statement continued may multiple element arrangement such software related multiple element arrangement include the sale of our software product software license update and product support contract and other software related service whereby software license delivery is followed by the subsequent or contemporaneous delivery of the other element for those software related multiple element arrangement we have applied the residual method to determine the amount of software license revenue to be recognized pursuant to asc under the residual method if fair value exists for undelivered element in multiple element arrangement such fair value of the undelivered element is deferred with the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration recognized upon delivery of the software license or service arrangement we allocate the fair value of each element of software related multiple element arrangement based upon it fair value determined by our vendor specific objective evidence vsoe described further below with any remaining amount allocated to the software license revenue recognition for hardware system product hardware system related service and cloud software subscription offering nonsoftware element revenue from the sale of hardware system product represent amount earned primarily from the sale of computer server and storage product our revenue recognition policy for these nonsoftware deliverable and other nonsoftware deliverable including hardware system related service and cloud software subscription offering is based upon the accounting guidance contained in asc revenue recognition and we exercise judgment and use estimate in connection with the determination of the amount of hardware system product hardware system related service revenue and cloud software subscription revenue to be recognized in each accounting period revenue from the sale of our nonsoftware element are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we deliver the product and passage of the title to the buyer occurs the sale price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured revenue that are not recognized at the time of sale because the foregoing condition are not met are recognized when those condition are subsequently met when applicable we reduce revenue for estimated return or certain other incentive program where we have the ability to sufficiently estimate the effect of these item where an arrangement is subject to acceptance criterion and the acceptance provision are not perfunctory for example acceptance provision that are long term in nature or are not included standard term of an arrangement revenue are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period our hardware system support offering generally provide customer with software update for the software component that are essential to the functionality of our server and storage product and can also include product repair maintenance service and technical support service hardware system support contract are generally priced percentage of the net hardware system product fee hardware system support contract are entered into at the customer option and are recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangement which are typically one year our cloud software subscription offering generally provide customer access to certain of our software within cloud based it environment that we manage and offer to customer on subscription basis revenue for our cloud software subscription offering are recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date our service is made available to customer and all other revenue recognition criterion have been satisfied revenue recognition for multiple element arrangement hardware system product and hardware system related service nonsoftware arrangement we enter into arrangement with customer that purchase both nonsoftware related product and service from at the same time or within close proximity of one another referred to nonsoftware multiple element arrangement each element within nonsoftware multiple element arrangement is accounted for separate table of content oracle corporation note to consolidated financial statement continued may unit of accounting provided the following criterion are met the delivered product or service have value to the customer on standalone basis and for an arrangement that includes general right of return relative to the delivered product or service delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by we consider deliverable to have standalone value if the product or service is sold separately by or another vendor or could be resold by the customer further our revenue arrangement generally do not include general right of return relative to the delivered product where the aforementioned criterion for separate unit of accounting are not met the deliverable is combined with the undelivered element and treated single unit of accounting for the purpose of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition for those unit of accounting that include more than one deliverable but are treated single unit of accounting we generally recognize revenue over the delivery period for the purpose of revenue classification of the element that are accounted for single unit of accounting we allocate revenue to the respective revenue line item within our consolidated statement of operation based on rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of relative selling price of such element for our nonsoftware multiple element arrangement we allocate revenue to each element based on selling price hierarchy at the arrangement inception the selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy vsoe if available third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe are available description to how we determine vsoe tpe and esp is provided below if tangible hardware system product includes software we determine whether the tangible hardware system product and the software work together to deliver the product essential functionality and if so the entire product is treated nonsoftware deliverable the total arrangement consideration is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the nonsoftware deliverable using the relative selling price of each unit based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy we limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered element to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional product or service or meeting of any specified performance condition when possible we establish vsoe of selling price for deliverable in nonsoftware multiple element arrangement using the price charged for deliverable when sold separately and for software license update and product support and hardware system support based on the renewal rate offered to customer tpe is established by evaluating similar and interchangeable competitor product or service in standalone arrangement with similarly situated customer if we are unable to determine the selling price because vsoe or tpe doe not exist we determine esp for the purpose of allocating the arrangement by reviewing historical transaction including transaction whereby the deliverable wa sold on standalone basis and considering several other external and internal factor including but not limited to pricing practice including discounting margin objective competition the geography in which we offer our product and service the type of customer distributor value added reseller government agency and direct end user among others and the stage of the product lifecycle the determination of esp is made through consultation with and approval by our management taking into consideration our pricing model and go to market strategy our or our competitor pricing and go to market strategy evolve we may modify our pricing practice in the future which could result in change to our determination of vsoe tpe and esp result our future revenue recognition for multiple element arrangement could differ materially from our result in the current period selling price are analyzed on an annual basis or more frequently if we experience significant change in our selling price revenue recognition policy applicable to both software and nonsoftware element revenue recognition for multiple element arrangement arrangement with software and nonsoftware element we also enter into multiple element arrangement that may include combination of our various software related and nonsoftware related product and service offering including hardware system product hardware system table of content oracle corporation note to consolidated financial statement continued may support new software license software license update and product support cloud software subscription consulting managed cloud service and education in such arrangement we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of the software group of element whole and to the nonsoftware element we then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective element within that group following the guidance in asc and our policy described above after the arrangement consideration ha been allocated to the element we account for each respective element in the arrangement described above other revenue recognition policy applicable to software and nonsoftware element many of our software arrangement include consulting implementation service sold separately under consulting engagement contract and are included part of our service business consulting revenue from these arrangement are generally accounted for separately from new software license revenue because the arrangement qualify service transaction defined in asc the more significant factor considered in determining whether the revenue should be accounted for separately include the nature of service consideration of whether the service are essential to the functionality of the licensed product degree of risk availability of service from other vendor timing of payment and impact of milestone or acceptance criterion on the realizability of the software license fee revenue for consulting service are generally recognized the service are performed if there is significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting service revenue are deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved we estimate the proportional performance on contract with fixed or not to exceed fee on monthly basis utilizing hour incurred to date percentage of total estimated hour to complete the project if we do not have sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion revenue are recognized when we receive final acceptance from the customer that the service have been completed when total cost estimate exceed revenue we accrue for the estimated loss immediately using cost estimate that are based upon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the service the complexity of the estimation process and factor relating to the assumption risk and uncertainty inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affect the amount of revenue and related expense reported in our consolidated financial statement number of internal and external factor can affect our estimate including labor rate utilization and efficiency variance and specification and testing requirement change our managed cloud service are offered standalone arrangement or part of arrangement to customer buying new software license or hardware system product and service oracle managed cloud service are designed to provide comprehensive software and hardware management and maintenance service for customer hosted at our oracle data center facility select partner data center or physically on premise at customer facility additionally we provide support service both on premise and remote to oracle customer to enable increased performance and higher availability of their product and service depending upon the nature of the arrangement revenue from managed cloud service are recognized service are performed or ratably over the term of the service period which is generally one year or le education revenue are also part of our service business and include instructor led medium based and internet based training in the use of our software and hardware product education revenue are recognized the class or other education offering are delivered if an arrangement contains multiple element and doe not qualify for separate accounting for the product and service transaction then new software license revenue and or hardware system product revenue including the cost of hardware system product are generally recognized together with the service based on contract accounting using either the percentage of completion or completed contract method contract accounting is applied to any bundled software hardware system and service arrangement that include milestone or customer specific acceptance criterion that may affect collection of the software license or hardware system table of content oracle corporation note to consolidated financial statement continued may product fee where consulting service include significant modification or customization of the software or hardware system product or are of specialized nature and generally performed only by oracle where significant consulting service are provided for in the software license contract or hardware system product contract without additional charge or are substantially discounted or where the software license or hardware system product payment is tied to the performance of consulting service for the purpose of revenue classification of the element that are accounted for single unit of accounting we allocate revenue to software and nonsoftware element based on rational and consistent methodology utilizing our best estimate of the relative selling price of such element we also evaluate arrangement with governmental entity containing fiscal funding or termination for convenience provision when such provision are required by law to determine the probability of possible cancellation we consider multiple factor including the history with the customer in similar transaction the essential use of the software or hardware system product and the planning budgeting and approval process undertaken by the governmental entity if we determine upon execution of these arrangement that the likelihood of cancellation is remote we then recognize revenue once all of the criterion described above have been met if such determination can not be made revenue are recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity we ass whether fee are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenue if all other revenue recognition requirement are met our standard payment term are net day however payment term may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed payment that are due within six month are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on our successful collection history on such arrangement and thereby satisfy the required criterion for revenue recognition while most of our arrangement for sale within our business include short term payment term we have standard practice of providing long term financing to creditworthy customer through our financing division since fiscal when our financing division wa formed we have established history of collection without concession on these receivables with payment term that generally extend up to five year from the contract date provided all other revenue recognition criterion have been met we recognize new software license revenue and hardware system product revenue for these arrangement upon delivery net of any payment discount from financing transaction we have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on non recourse basis to third party financing institution within day of the contract date of execution and we classify the proceeds from these sale cash flow from operating activity in our consolidated statement of cash flow we account

transact business in various foreign currency and have established program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contract to offset the risk associated with the effect of certain foreign currency exposure under this program our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contract so that increase or decrease in our foreign currency exposure are offset by gain or loss on the foreign currency forward contract in order to mitigate the risk and volatility associated with our foreign currency transaction we may suspend this program from time to time our foreign currency exposure typically arise from intercompany sublicense fee intercompany loan and other intercompany transaction that are expected to be cash settled in the near term our foreign currency forward
