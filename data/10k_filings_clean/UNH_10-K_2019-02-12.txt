any other public filing or statement we make may turn out to be wrong our forward looking statement can be affected by inaccurate assumption we might make or by known or unknown risk and uncertainty many factor discussed below will be important in determining our future result by their nature forward looking statement are not guarantee of future performance or result and are subject to risk uncertainty and assumption that are difficult to predict or quantify if we fail to estimate price for and manage our medical cost in an effective manner the profitability of our risk based product and service could decline and could materially and adversely affect our result of operation financial position and cash flow through our risk based benefit product we assume the risk of both medical and administrative cost for our customer in return for monthly premium premium revenue from risk based benefit product comprise nearly of our total consolidated revenue we generally use approximately to of our premium revenue to pay the cost of health care service delivered to these customer the profitability of our product depends in large part on our ability to predict price for and effectively manage medical cost in addition our optumhealth business negotiates capitation arrangement with commercial third party payer under the typical capitation arrangement the health care provider receives fixed percentage of third party payer premium to cover all or defined portion of the medical cost provided to the capitated member if we fail to predict accurately or effectively price for or manage the cost of providing care to our capitated member our result of operation could be materially and adversely affected we manage medical cost through underwriting criterion product design negotiation of favorable provider contract and care management program total medical cost are affected by the number of individual service rendered the cost of each service and the type of service rendered our premium revenue on commercial policy and medicaid contract are typically based on fixed monthly rate per individual served for month period and is generally priced one to six month before the contract commences our revenue on medicare policy is based on bid submitted to cm in june the year before the contract year although we base the commercial and medicaid premium we charge and our medicare bid on our estimate of future medical cost over the fixed contract period many factor may cause actual cost to exceed those estimated and reflected in premium or bid these factor may include medical cost inflation increased use of service increased cost of individual service large scale medical emergency the introduction of new or costly drug treatment and technology new treatment guideline new mandated benefit such the expansion of essential benefit coverage or other regulatory change and insured population characteristic relatively small difference between predicted and actual medical cost or utilization rate percentage of revenue can result in significant change in our financial result for example if our medical cost for commercial insured product been higher than our actual medical cost without proportionally higher revenue from such product our annual net earnings for would have been reduced by approximately million excluding any offsetting impact from risk adjustment or from reduced premium rebate due to minimum mlrs in addition the financial result we report for any particular period include estimate of cost that have been incurred for which claim are still outstanding these estimate involve an extensive degree of judgment if these estimate prove inaccurate our result of operation could be materially and adversely affected our business activity are highly regulated and new law or regulation or change in existing law or regulation or their enforcement or application could materially and adversely affect our business we are regulated by federal state and local government in the united state and other country where we do business our insurance and hmo subsidiary must be licensed by and are subject to regulation in the jurisdiction in which they conduct business for example state require periodic financial report and enforce minimum capital or restricted cash reserve requirement health plan and insurance company are also regulated under state insurance holding company regulation and some of our activity may be subject to other health care related regulation and requirement including those relating to ppos mcos ur and tpa related regulation and licensure requirement under state guaranty association law certain insurance company can be assessed to prescribed limit for certain obligation to the policyholder and claimant of impaired or insolvent insurance company that write the line or similar line of business any such assessment could of contentsexpose our insurance entity and other insurer to the risk that they would be required to pay portion of an impaired or insolvent insurance company claim through state guaranty association certain of our business provide product or service to various government agency for example some of our unitedhealthcare and optum business hold government contract or provide service related to government contract and are subject to federal and state and non self referral anti kickback medical necessity risk adjustment false claim and other law and regulation governing government contractor and the use of government fund our relationship with these government agency are subject to the term of contract that we hold with the agency and to law and regulation regarding government contract among others certain law and regulation restrict or prohibit company from performing work for government agency that might be viewed an actual or potential conflict of interest these law may limit our ability to pursue and perform certain type of work thereby materially and adversely affecting our result of operation financial position and cash flow certain of our optum business are also subject to regulation that are distinct from those faced by our insurance and hmo subsidiary including for example state telemedicine regulation debt collection law banking regulation distributor and producer licensing requirement state corporate practice of medicine doctrine fee splitting rule and health care facility licensure and certificate of need requirement some of which could impact our relationship with physician hospital and customer these risk and uncertainty may materially and adversely affect our ability to market or provide our product and service or to do at targeted operating margin or may increase the regulatory burden under which we operate the law and rule governing our business and interpretation of those law and rule are subject to frequent change for example legislative administrative and public policy change to the aca are being considered and we can not predict if the aca will be further modified or repealed or replaced litigation challenge have been brought seeking to invalidate the aca in whole or in part and federal district court struck the aca in it entirety unconstitutional in that opinion ha been stayed and appealed further the integration into our business of entity that we acquire may affect the way in which existing law and rule apply to including by subjecting to law and rule that not previously apply to the broad latitude given to the agency administering interpreting and enforcing current and future regulation governing our business could force to change how we do business restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our health care and administrative cost and capital requirement or expose to increased liability in court for coverage determination contract interpretation and other action we also must obtain and maintain regulatory approval to market many of our product and service increase price for certain regulated product and service and complete certain acquisition and disposition or integrate certain acquisition for example premium rate for our health insurance and managed care product are subject to regulatory review or approval in many state and by the federal government additionally we must submit data on all proposed rate increase on many of our product to hhs for monitoring purpose geographic and product expansion may be subject to state and federal regulatory approval delay in obtaining necessary approval or our failure to obtain or maintain adequate approval could materially and adversely affect our result of operation financial position and cash flow certain of our business operate internationally and are subject to regulation in the jurisdiction in which they are organized or conduct business these regulatory regime encompass among other matter local and cross border taxation licensing tariff intellectual property investment capital including minimum solvency margin and reserve requirement management control labor anti fraud anti corruption and privacy and data protection regulation including requirement for cross border data transfer that vary by jurisdiction we currently operate outside of the united state and in the future may acquire or commence additional business based outside of the united state increasing our exposure to non regulatory regime for example our unitedhealthcare global business subject to brazilian law and regulation affecting hospital managed care and insurance industry and to regulation by brazilian regulator including the national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plan the agência nacional de saúde suplementar while the banmédica business is subject to chilean colombian and peruvian law regulation and regulator applicable to hospital and private insurance any international regulator may take an approach to the interpretation implementation and enforcement of industry regulation that could differ from the approach taken by regulator in addition our non business and operation are subject to law that regulate the conduct and activity of based business operating abroad such the fcpa which prohibits offering promising providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure business advantage our failure to comply with or non law and regulation governing our conduct outside the united state or to establish constructive relation with non regulator could adversely affect our ability to market our product and service or to do so at targeted operating margin which may have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation the health care industry is regularly subject to negative publicity including result of governmental investigation adverse medium coverage and political debate surrounding industry regulation negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various market of contentsas result of our participation in various government health care program both payer and service provider to payer we are exposed to additional risk associated with program funding enrollment payment adjustment audit and government investigation that could materially and adversely affect our business result of operation financial position and cash flow we participate in various federal state and local government health care benefit program including payer in medicare advantage medicare part various medicaid program and chip and receive substantial revenue from these program certain of our optum business also provide service to payer participating in government health care program reduction or le than expected increase or protracted delay in government funding for these program or change in allocation methodology or termination of the contract at the option of the government may materially and adversely affect our result of operation financial position and cash flow the government health care program in which we participate generally are subject to frequent change including change that may reduce the number of person enrolled or eligible for coverage reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment level reduce our participation in certain service area or market or increase our administrative or medical cost under such program revenue for these program depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state government and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanism funding for these government program depends on many factor outside of our control including general economic condition and budgetary constraint at the federal or applicable state level for example cm ha in the past reduced or frozen medicare advantage benchmark and additional cut to medicare advantage benchmark are possible in addition from time to time cm make change to the way it calculates medicare advantage risk adjustment payment although we have adjusted member benefit and premium on selective basis ceased to offer benefit plan in certain county and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to the benchmark reduction and other funding pressure these or other strategy may not fully address the funding pressure in the medicare advantage program in addition payer in the medicare advantage program may be subject to reduction in payment from cm result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit under the medicaid managed care program state medicaid agency seek bid from eligible health plan to continue their participation in the acute care medicaid health program if we are not successful in obtaining renewal of state medicaid managed care contract we risk losing the member that were enrolled in those medicaid plan under the medicare part program to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income member our bid must result in an enrollee premium below regional benchmark which is calculated by the government after all regional bid are submitted if the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark we risk losing the member who were auto assigned to and will not have additional member auto assigned to in general our bid are based upon certain assumption regarding enrollment utilization medical cost and other factor if any of these assumption is materially incorrect either result of unforeseen change to the program on which we bid or submission by our competitor at lower rate than our bid our result of operation financial position and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected many of the government health care coverage program in which we participate are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain condition or performance standard or benchmark for example part of the aca cm ha system that provides various quality bonus payment to medicare advantage plan that meet certain quality star rating at the individual plan or local contract level the star rating system considers various measure adopted by cm including among others quality of care preventive service chronic illness management and customer satisfaction plan must have rating of four star or higher to qualify for bonus payment if we do not maintain or continue to improve our star rating our plan may not be eligible for quality bonus and we may experience negative impact on our revenue and the benefit that our plan can offer which could materially and adversely affect the marketability of our plan our membership level result of operation financial position and cash flow any change in standard or care delivery model that apply to government health care program including medicare and medicaid or our inability to improve our quality score and star rating to meet government performance requirement or to match the performance of our competitor could result in limitation to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government program which in turn could materially and adversely affect our result of operation financial position and cash flow cm us various payment mechanism to allocate funding for medicare program including adjustment of monthly capitation payment to medicare advantage plan and medicare part plan according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary supported by data from health care provider for medicare advantage plan well for medicare part plan risk sharing provision based on comparison of cost predicted in our annual bid to actual prescription drug cost some state medicaid program utilize similar process for example our unitedhealthcare medicare retirement and unitedhealthcare community state business submit information relating to the health status of enrollee to cm or state agency for purpose of determining the amount of certain payment to cm and the office of inspector general for hhs periodically perform risk adjustment data validation radv audit of selected medicare health plan to validate the coding practice of and supporting documentation maintained by health care provider certain of our local plan have been selected for such audit which have in the past resulted and could in the future result in retrospective adjustment to payment made to our health plan fine corrective action plan or other adverse action by cm of contentswe have been and may in the future become involved in routine regular and special governmental investigation audit review and assessment for example various governmental agency have conducted investigation into certain pbm practice which have resulted in other pbms agreeing to civil penalty including the payment of money and corporate integrity agreement additionally such investigation audit or review sometimes arise out of or prompt claim by private litigant or whistleblower that among other allegation we failed to disclose certain business practice or government contractor submitted false or erroneous claim to the government governmental investigation audit review and assessment could lead to government action which could result in adverse publicity the assessment of damage civil or criminal fine or penalty or other sanction including restriction or change in the way we conduct business loss of licensure or exclusion from participation in government program any of which could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial position and cash flow if we sustain cyber attack or other privacy or data security incident that result in security breach that disrupt our operation or result in the unintended dissemination of protected personal information or proprietary or confidential information we could suffer loss of revenue and increased cost exposure to significant liability reputational harm and other serious negative consequence we routinely process store and transmit large amount of data in our operation including protected personal information well proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third party some of the data we process store and transmit may be outside of the united state due to our information technology system and international business operation we are regularly the target of attempted cyber attack and other security threat and may be subject to breach of the information technology system we use we have program in place that are intended to detect contain and respond to data security incident and that provide employee awareness training regarding phishing malware and other cyber risk to protect cyber risk and security breach however because the technique used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage system change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long period of time we may be unable to anticipate these technique or implement adequate preventive measure experienced computer programmer and hacker may be able to penetrate our security control and access misappropriate or otherwise compromise protected personal information or proprietary or confidential information or that of third party create system disruption or cause system shutdown that could negatively affect our operation they also may be able to develop and deploy virus worm and other malicious software program that attack our system or otherwise exploit any security vulnerability hardware software or application we develop or procure from third party may contain defect in design or manufacture or other problem that could unexpectedly compromise information security our facility and service may also be vulnerable to security incident or security attack act of vandalism or theft coordinated attack by activist entity misplaced or lost data human error malicious social engineering or other event that could negatively affect our system our customer data proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third party or our operation in certain circumstance we may rely on third party vendor to process store and transmit large amount of data for our business whose operation are subject to similar risk the cost to eliminate or address the foregoing security threat and vulnerability before or after cyber incident could be material our remediation effort may not be successful and could result in interruption delay or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customer in addition breach of our security measure and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information proprietary information or confidential information about or our customer or other third party could expose our customer private information and our customer to the risk of financial or medical identity theft or expose or other third party to risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability including regulatory penalty for damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business if we fail to comply with applicable privacy security and data law regulation and standard including with respect to third party service provider that utilize protected personal information on our behalf our business reputation result of operation financial position and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected the collection maintenance protection use transmission disclosure and disposal of protected personal information is regulated at the federal state international and industry level and requirement are imposed on by contract with customer these law rule and requirement are subject to change compliance with new privacy and security law regulation and requirement may result in increased operating cost and may constrain or require to alter our business model or operation for example the hitech amendment to hipaa imposed further restriction on our ability to collect disclose and use protected personal information and imposed additional compliance requirement on our business internationally many of the jurisdiction in which we operate have established their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customer must comply we expect that there will continue to be new proposed law regulation and industry standard concerning privacy data protection and information security in the european union brazil chile india and other jurisdiction and we can not yet determine the impact such future law regulation and standard may have on our business or the business of our customer for example effective may the european union general data protection regulation gdpr overhauled data protection law in the european union the new regulation superseded of contentsprior european union privacy and data protection legislation imposed more stringent european union data protection requirement on or our customer and prescribed greater penalty for noncompliance brazilian privacy legislation similar in certain respect to gdpr go into effect in many of our business are also subject to the payment card industry data security standard which is multifaceted security standard that is designed to protect credit card account data hipaa requires business associate well covered entity to comply with certain privacy and security requirement while we provide for appropriate protection through our contract with our third party service provider and in certain case ass their security control we have limited oversight or control over their action and practice several of our business act business associate to their covered entity customer and result collect use disclose and maintain protected personal information in order to provide service to these customer hhs ha announced that it will continue it audit program to ass hipaa compliance effort by covered entity and expand it to include business associate an audit resulting in finding or allegation of noncompliance could have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial position and cash flow through our optum business including our optum lab business we maintain database of administrative and clinical data that is statistically de identified in accordance with hipaa standard noncompliance or finding of noncompliance with applicable law regulation or requirement or the occurrence of any privacy or security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of protected personal information whether by or by one of our third party service provider could have material adverse effect on our reputation and business and among other consequence could subject to mandatory disclosure to the medium loss of existing or new customer significant increase in the cost of managing and remediating privacy or security incident and material fine penalty and litigation award any of these consequence could have material and adverse effect on our result of operation financial position and cash flow our business providing pharmacy care service face regulatory and operational risk and uncertainty that may differ from the risk of our other business we provide pharmacy care service through our optumrx and unitedhealthcare business each business is subject to federal and state anti kickback beneficiary inducement and other law that govern the relationship of the business with pharmaceutical manufacturer physician pharmacy customer and consumer provider of pharmacy benefit management service optumrx is also subject to an increasing number of licensure registration and other law and accreditation standard that impact the business practice of pharmacy benefit manager optumrx also conduct business through home delivery specialty and compounding pharmacy pharmacy located in community mental health center and home infusion which subject it to extensive federal state and local law and regulation including those of the dea and individual state controlled substance authority the fda and board of pharmacy in addition federal and state legislature regularly consider new regulation for the industry that could materially affect current industry practice including potential new legislation and regulation regarding the receipt or disclosure of rebate and other fee from pharmaceutical company the development and use of formulary and other utilization management tool the use of average wholesale price or other pricing benchmark pricing for specialty pharmaceutical limited access to network and pharmacy network reimbursement methodology we could face potential claim in connection with purported error by our home delivery specialty or compounding or clinic based pharmacy or the provision of home infusion service including result of the risk inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceutical and other health care product disruption from any of our home delivery specialty pharmacy or home infusion service could materially and adversely affect our result of operation financial position and cash flow in addition our pharmacy care service business provide service to sponsor of health benefit plan that are subject to erisa private party or the dol which is the agency that enforces erisa could assert that the fiduciary obligation imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the service provided by our pharmacy care service business even where those business are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligation if court were to determine that fiduciary obligation apply we could be subject to claim for breach of fiduciary obligation or claim that we entered into certain prohibited transaction if we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share including maintaining or increasing enrollment in business providing health benefit our result of operation financial position and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected our business compete throughout the united state south america and other foreign market and face significant competition in all of the geographic market in which we operate in particular market our competitor compared to may have greater capability resource or market share more established reputation superior supplier or health care professional arrangement better existing business relationship lower profit margin or financial return expectation or other factor that give such competitor competitive advantage our competitive position may also be adversely affected by significant merger of contentsand acquisition activity that ha occurred in the industry in which we operate both among our competitor and supplier including hospital physician group and other health care professional consolidation may make it more difficult for to retain or increase our customer base improve the term on which we do business with our supplier or maintain or increase profitability in addition our success in the health care marketplace will depend on our ability to develop and deliver innovative and potentially disruptive product and service to satisfy evolving market demand if we do not continue to innovate and provide product and service that are useful and relevant to consumer we may not remain competitive and we risk losing market share to existing competitor and disruptive new market entrant for example new direct to consumer business model from competing business may make it more difficult for to directly engage consumer in the selection and management of their health care benefit and health care usage and we may face challenge from new technology and market entrant that could affect our existing relationship with health plan enrollee in these area our business result of operation financial position and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected if we do not compete effectively in our market if we set rate high or too low in highly competitive market if we do not design and price our product properly and competitively if we are unable to innovate and deliver product and service that demonstrate value to our customer if we do not provide satisfactory level of service if membership or demand for other service not increase we expect or decline or if we lose account with more profitable product while retaining or increasing membership in account with le profitable product if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationship with physician hospital and other service provider our business could be materially and adversely affected our result of operation and prospect are substantially dependent on our continued ability to contract with physician hospital pharmaceutical benefit service provider pharmaceutical manufacturer and other service provider at competitive price any failure by to develop and maintain satisfactory relationship with health care provider whether in network or out of network could materially and adversely affect our business result of operation financial position and cash flow in addition certain activity related to network design provider participation in network and provider payment could result in dispute that may be costly divert management attention from our operation and result in negative publicity in any particular market physician and health care provider could refuse to contract demand higher payment or take other action that could result in higher medical cost le desirable product for customer or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirement in some market certain health care provider particularly hospital physician and hospital organization or multi specialty physician group may have significant market position or near monopoly that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part in addition acos practice management company which aggregate physician practice for administrative efficiency and other organizational structure adopted by physician hospital and other care provider may change the way in which these provider do business with and may change the competitive landscape such organization or group of physician may compete directly with which could adversely affect our business and our result of operation financial position and cash flow by impacting our relationship with these provider or affecting the way that we price our product and estimate our cost which might require to incur cost to change our operation in addition if these provider refuse to contract with use their market position to negotiate favorable contract or place at competitive disadvantage our ability to market product or to be profitable in those area could be materially and adversely affected our health care benefit business have capitation arrangement with some physician hospital and other health care provider capitation arrangement limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical cost but expose to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resource of the health care provider to the extent that capitated health care provider organization face financial difficulty or otherwise is unable to perform it obligation under the capitation arrangement we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claim that should have been the responsibility of the capitated health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider under the capitation arrangement further payment or other dispute between primary care provider and specialist with the primary care provider contract could result in disruption in the provision of service to our member or reduction in the service available to our member health care provider with which we contract may not properly manage the cost of service maintain financial solvency or avoid dispute with other provider any of these event could have material adverse effect on the provision of service to our member and our operation some provider that render service to our member do not have contract with in those case we do not have pre established understanding about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider for service rendered to our member in some state the amount of compensation due to these out of network provider is defined by law or regulation but in most instance the amount is either not defined or is established by standard that doe not clearly specify dollar term in some instance provider may believe that they are underpaid for their service and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with or try to recover from our member the difference between we have paid them and the amount they charged the success of some of our business including optumhealth and unitedhealthcare global depend on maintaining satisfactory relationship with physician our employee independent contractor or joint venture partner the physician that practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organization could terminate their provider contract or of contentsotherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with there is and will likely be heightened competition in the market where we operate to acquire or manage physician practice or to employ or

classified thereafter pending acquisition in december we entered into an agreement to acquire company in the health care sector for total of approximately billion which is not reflected in the table we do not have other significant contractual obligation or commitment that require cash resource however we continually evaluate opportunity to expand our operation which include internal development of new product program and technology application and may include acquisition balance sheet arrangementsas of december we were not involved in any off balance sheet arrangement which have or are reasonably likely to have material effect on our financial condition result of operation or liquidity recently issued accounting standard see note of note to the consolidated financial statement in part ii item financial statement and supplementary data for discussion of new accounting pronouncement that affect critical accounting estimatescritical accounting estimate are those estimate that require management to make challenging subjective or complex judgment often because they must estimate the effect of matter that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent period critical accounting estimate involve judgment and uncertainty that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different result under different assumption and condition medical cost payablemedical cost and medical cost payable include estimate of our obligation for medical care service that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumer but for which claim have either not yet been received or processed depending on the health care professional and type of service the typical billing lag for service can be up to day from the date of service approximately of claim related to medical care service are known and settled within day from the date of service and substantially all within twelve month of december our day outstanding in medical payable wa day calculated total medical payable divided by total medical cost time the number of day in the period of contentsin each reporting period our operating result include the effect of more completely developed medical cost payable estimate associated with previously reported period if the revised estimate of prior period medical cost is le than the previous estimate we will decrease reported medical cost in the current period favorable development if the revised estimate of prior period medical cost is more than the previous estimate we will increase reported medical cost in the current period unfavorable development medical cost in and included favorable medical cost development related to prior year of million million and million respectively in developing our medical cost payable estimate we apply different estimation method depending on the month for which incurred claim are being estimated for example for the most recent two month we estimate claim cost incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factor to the average per member per month pmpm medical cost incurred in prior month for which more complete claim data is available supplemented by review of near term completion factor completion factor completion factor is an actuarial estimate based upon historical experience and analysis of current trend of the percentage of incurred claim during given period that have been adjudicated by at the date of estimation completion factor are the most significant factor we use in developing our medical cost payable estimate for period prior to the most recent two month completion factor include judgment in relation to claim submission such the time from date of service to claim receipt claim inventory level and claim processing backlog well other factor if actual claim submission rate from provider which can be influenced by number of factor including provider mix and electronic versus manual submission or our claim processing pattern are different than estimated our reserve estimate may be significantly impacted the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factor and the estimated potential impact on our medical cost payable estimate for those period of december completion factor decrease increase in factor increase decrease in medical cost payable in million medical cost per member per month trend factor medical cost pmpm trend factor are significant factor we use in developing our medical cost payable estimate for the most recent two month medical cost trend factor are developed through comprehensive analysis of claim incurred in prior month provider contracting and expected unit cost benefit design and review of broad set of health care utilization indicator including but not limited to pharmacy utilization trend inpatient hospital authorization data and influenza incidence data from the national center for disease control we also consider macroeconomic variable such gdp growth employment and disposable income large number of factor can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimate including our ability and practice to manage medical and pharmaceutical cost change in level and mix of service utilized mix of benefit offered including the impact of co pay and deductible change in medical practice catastrophe and epidemic the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factor and the estimated potential impact on our medical cost payable estimate for the most recent two month of december medical cost pmpm quarterly trendincrease decrease in factor increase decrease in medical cost payable in million of contentsthe completion factor and medical cost pmpm trend factor analysis above include outcome that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liability for incurred but not reported benefit claim management belief the amount of medical cost payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claim of december however actual claim payment may differ from established estimate discussed above assuming hypothetical difference between our december estimate of medical cost payable and actual medical cost payable excluding aarp medicare supplement insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebate net earnings would have increased or decreased by approximately million for more detail related to our medical cost estimate see note of note to the consolidated financial statement included in part ii item financial statement and supplementary data revenue we derive substantial portion of our revenue from health care insurance premium we recognize premium revenue in the period eligible individual are entitled to receive health care service customer are typically billed monthly at contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive service our medicare advantage and medicare part premium revenue are subject to periodic adjustment under the cm risk adjustment payment methodology the cm risk adjustment model provides higher per member payment for enrollee diagnosed with certain condition and lower payment for enrollee who are healthier we estimate risk adjustment revenue based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to cm result of the variability of factor that determine such estimation the actual amount of cm retroactive payment could be materially more or le than our estimate this may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustment to our medicare premium revenue and accordingly our profitability for more detail on premium revenue see note of note to the consolidated financial statement included in part ii item financial statement and supplementary data risk adjustment data for our plan is subject to review by the federal and state government including audit by regulator see note of note to the consolidated financial statement included in part ii item financial statement and supplementary data for additional information regarding these audit our estimate of premium to be recognized are reduced by any expected premium minimum mlr rebate payable by goodwill and intangible asset goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstance change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable when testing goodwill for impairment we may first ass qualitative factor to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying value of reporting unit exceeds it estimated fair value during qualitative analysis we consider the impact of change if any to the following factor macroeconomic industry and market factor cost factor change in overall financial performance and any other relevant event and uncertainty impacting reporting unit if our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not we perform additional quantitative analysis we may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing for reporting unit where quantitative analysis is performed we perform multi step test measuring the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing them to their aggregate carrying value including goodwill if the fair value is le than the carrying value of the reporting unit then the implied value of goodwill would be calculated and compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine whether goodwill is impaired we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit using discounted cash flow which include assumption about wide variety of internal and external factor significant assumption used in the impairment analysis include financial projection of free cash flow including significant assumption about operation capital requirement and income tax long term growth rate for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted period and discount rate for each reporting unit comparative market multiple are used to corroborate the result of our discounted cash flow test forecast and long term growth rate used for our reporting unit are consistent with and use input from our internal long term business plan and strategy key assumption used in these forecast include revenue trend key revenue driver for each reporting unit are determined and assessed significant factor include customer and or membership growth medical trend and the impact and expectation of regulatory environment additional macro economic assumption relating to unemployment gdp growth interest rate and inflation are also evaluated and incorporated appropriate medical cost trend for further discussion of medical cost trend see the medical cost trend section of executive overview business trend and the medical cost payable critical accounting estimate above similar factor including historical and expected medical cost trend level are considered in estimating our long term medical trend at the reporting unit level of content operating productivity we forecast expected operating cost level based on historical level and expectation of future operating cost level capital level the operating and long term capital requirement for each business are considered discount rate are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecast our most significant estimate in the discount rate determination involves our adjustment to the peer company weighted average cost of capital that reflect reporting unit specific factor we have not made any adjustment to decrease discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit company specific adjustment to discount rate are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty the passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding area of uncertainty with respect to the reporting unit operation could cause these assumption to change in the future of october we completed our annual impairment test for goodwill with all of our reporting unit fair value substantially in excess of their carrying value intangible asset our finite lived intangible asset are subject to impairment test when event or circumstance indicate that an asset or asset group carrying value may exceed it estimated fair value consideration is given on quarterly basis to number of potential impairment indicator including change in the use of the asset change in legal or other business factor that could affect value experienced or expected operating cash flow deterioration or loss adverse change in customer population adverse competitive or technological advance that could impact value and other factor our indefinite lived intangible asset are tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicator exist to determine if an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired we compare it estimated fair value to it carrying value if the carrying value exceeds it estimated fair value an impairment would be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds it estimated fair value intangible asset were not impaired in

summarized follows level quoted price unadjusted for identical asset liability in active market level other observable input either directly or indirectly including quoted price for similar asset liability in active market quoted price for identical or similar asset liability in inactive market transaction limited information noncurrent price high variability over time input other than quoted
