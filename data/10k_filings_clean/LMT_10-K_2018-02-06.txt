of product and service competes both domestically and internationally product and service of other large aerospace and defense company well numerous smaller competitor change within the industry we operate in such vertical integration by our peer could negatively impact we often form team with our competitor in effort to provide our customer with the best mix of capability to address specific requirement in area of our business customer requirement are changing to encourage expanded competition and increasingly would have previously been competed single large procurement is being broken into multiple smaller procurement principal factor of competition include the value of our product and service to the customer technical and management capability the ability to develop and implement complex integrated system architecture total cost of ownership our demonstrated ability to execute and perform against contract requirement and our ability to provide timely solution technological advance in such area additive manufacturing cloud computing advanced material autonomy robotics and big data and new business model such commercial access to space are enabling new factor of competition for both traditional and non traditional competitor the competition for international sale is generally subject to government stipulation export restriction market access technology transfer industrial cooperation and contracting practice we may compete against and non company or team for contract award by international government international competition also may be subject to different law or contracting practice of international government that may affect we structure our bid for the procurement in many international procurement the purchasing government relationship with the and it industrial cooperation program are also important factor in determining the outcome of competition is common for international customer to require contractor to comply with industrial cooperation regulation sometimes referred to offset requirement and we have entered into foreign offset agreement part of securing some international business for information concerning offset agreement see contractual commitment and balance sheet arrangement in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation intellectual propertywe routinely apply for and substantial number of and foreign patent related to the product and service we provide in addition to owning large portfolio of patent we own other intellectual property including trademark copyright trade secret and know how unpatented research development and engineering skill also make an important contribution to our business we also license intellectual property to and from third party the federal acquisition regulation far provides that the government ha license in our intellectual property including patent that are developed in performance of government contract or with government funding and it may use or authorize others including competitor to use such intellectual property commonly referred to government use right the government is taking increasingly aggressive position under the far both to what intellectual property believe such right apply and to acquire broad license right to use and have others use such intellectual property if the government is successful in these effort this could affect our ability to compete and to obtain access to and use certain supplier intellectual property foreign government may also have certain right in patent and other intellectual property developed in performance of foreign government contract although our intellectual property right in the aggregate are important to the operation of our business we not believe that any existing patent license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that it loss or termination would have material adverse effect on our business taken whole raw material and seasonalitysome of our product require relatively scarce raw material historically we have been successful in obtaining the raw material and other supply needed in our manufacturing process we seek to manage raw material supply risk through long term contract and by maintaining an acceptable level of the key material in inventory aluminum and titanium are important raw material used in certain of our aeronautics and space program long term agreement have helped enable continued supply of aluminum and titanium carbon fiber is an important ingredient in composite material used in our aeronautics program such the aircraft we have been advised by some supplier that pricing and the timing of availability of material in some commodity market fluctuate widely these fluctuation may negatively affect the price and availability of certain material while we do not anticipate material problem regarding the supply of our raw of contentsmaterials and believe that we have taken appropriate measure to mitigate these variation if key material become unavailable or if pricing fluctuates widely in the future it could result in delay of one or more of our program increased cost or reduced operating profit no material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal various factor can affect the distribution of our sale accounting period including the timing of government award the availability of government funding product delivery and customer acceptance government contract and regulationsour business is heavily regulated we contract with numerous government agency and entity

can not be eliminated or necessarily predicted the outcome of one or more of these risk could have material effect on our operating result financial position or cash flow should carefully consider the following factor in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form deciding to purchase our common stock or debt security we depend heavily on contract with the government for substantial portion of our business we derived of our total net sale from the government in including from the department of defense dod we expect to continue to derive most of our sale from work performed under government contract those contract are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriation congress usually appropriates fund on fiscal year basis even though contract performance may extend over many year consequently contract are often partially funded initially and additional fund are committed only congress make appropriation if we incur cost in excess of fund obligated on contract we may be at risk for reimbursement of those cost unless and additional fund are obligated to the contract the is our largest program and represented of our total net sale in and is expected to represent higher percentage of our sale in future year decision to cut spending or reduce planned order would have an adverse impact on our result of operation given the size and complexity of the program we anticipate that there will be continual review related to aircraft performance program schedule cost and requirement part of the dod congressional and international partner oversight and budgeting process current program challenge include but are not limited to increasing manufacturing capability to meet higher customer demand for new aircraft and sustainment activity supplier and partner performance software development level of cost associated with life cycle operation and sustainment and warranty successfully negotiating and receiving funding for production contract on timely basis executing future flight test and finding resulting from testing and operating the aircraft additionally the government may also enter into unilateral contract action unilateral contract action obligates to perform under term and condition imposed by the government unilateral contract action could negatively affect profit and cash flow and establish precedent for future contract based upon our diverse range of defense homeland security and information technology product and service we believe that this make it le likely that cut in any specific contract or program will have long term effect on our business however termination of multiple or large program or contract could adversely affect our business and future financial performance potential change in funding priority may afford new or additional opportunity for our business in term of existing follow on or replacement program while we would expect to compete and be well positioned the incumbent on existing program we may not be successful or the replacement program may be funded at lower level we are subject to number of procurement law and regulation our business and our reputation could be adversely affected if we fail to comply with these law we must comply with and are affected by law and regulation relating to the award administration and performance of government contract government contract law and regulation affect how we do business with our customer and impose certain risk and cost on our business violation of specific law and regulation by our employee others working on our behalf supplier or venture partner could harm our reputation and result in the imposition of fine and penalty the termination of our contract suspension or debarment from bidding on or being awarded contract loss of our ability to export product or service and civil or criminal investigation or proceeding in some instance these law and regulation impose term or right that are different from those typically found in commercial transaction for example the government may terminate any of our government contract and subcontract either at it convenience or for default based on our performance upon termination for convenience of fixed price type contract we normally of contentsare entitled to receive the purchase price for delivered item reimbursement for allowable cost for work in process and an allowance for profit on the contract or adjustment for loss if completion of performance would have resulted in loss upon termination for convenience of cost reimbursable contract we normally are entitled to reimbursement of allowable cost plus portion of the fee allowable cost would include our cost to terminate agreement with our supplier and subcontractor the amount of the fee recovered if any is related to the portion of the work accomplished prior to termination and is determined by negotiation we attempt to ensure that adequate fund are available by notifying the customer it estimated cost including those associated with possible termination for convenience approach level specified being allotted to it program fund are typically appropriated on fiscal year basis and the cost of termination for convenience may exceed the cost of continuing program in given fiscal year occasionally program do not have sufficient fund appropriated to cover the termination cost were the government to terminate them for convenience under such circumstance the government could assert that it is not required to appropriate additional funding termination arising of our default may expose to liability and have material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contract and order in addition on those contract for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor the government could terminate prime contract under which we are subcontractor notwithstanding the quality of our service subcontractor in the case of termination for default the government could make claim to reduce the contract value or recover it procurement cost and could ass other special penalty however under such circumstance we have right and remedial action under law and the federal acquisition regulation far in addition certain of our government contract span one or more base year and multiple option year the government generally ha the right not to exercise option period and may not exercise an option period for various reason however the government may exercise option period even for contract for which it is expected that our cost may exceed the contract price or ceiling government agency including the defense contract audit agency the defense contract management agency and various agency inspector general routinely audit and investigate government contractor these agency review contractor performance under it contract it cost structure it business system and compliance with applicable law regulation and standard the government ha the ability to decrease or withhold certain payment when it deems system subject to it review to be inadequate additionally any cost found to be misclassified may be subject to repayment we have unaudited and or unsettled incurred cost claim related to past year which place risk on our ability to issue final billing on contract for which authorized and appropriated fund may be expiring if an audit or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activity we may be subject to civil or criminal penalty and administrative sanction including reduction of the value of contract contract modification or termination forfeiture of profit suspension of payment penalty fine and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the government in addition we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegation of impropriety were made against similar government oversight exists in most other country where we conduct business our profitability and cash flow may vary based on the mix of our contract and program our performance our ability to control cost and evolving government procurement policy our profitability and cash flow may vary materially depending on the type of government contract undertaken the nature of product produced or service performed under those contract the cost incurred in performing the work the achievement of other performance objective and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fee is determined particularly under award and incentive fee contract our backlog includes variety of contract type that are intended to address changing risk and reward profile program matures contract type include cost reimbursable fixed price incentive fee fixed price and time and material contract contract for development program with complex design and technical challenge are typically cost reimbursable under cost reimbursable contract we are reimbursed for allowable cost and paid fee which may be fixed or performance based in these case the associated financial risk primarily relate to reduction in fee and the program could be canceled if cost schedule or technical performance issue arise other contract in backlog are for the transition from development to production low rate initial production lrip contract which includes the challenge of starting and stabilizing manufacturing production and test line while the final design is being validated these generally are cost reimbursable or fixed price incentive fee contract under fixed price incentive fee contract the allowable cost incurred are eligible for reimbursement but are subject to cost share arrangement which affect profitability generally if our cost exceed the contract target cost or are not allowable under the applicable regulation we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all cost and may have our fee reduced or eliminated of contentsthere are also contract for production well operation and maintenance of the delivered product that have the challenge of achieving stable production and delivery rate while maintaining operability of the product after delivery these contract are mainly fixed price although some operation and maintenance contract are time and material type under fixed price contract we receive fixed price regardless of the actual cost we incur we have to absorb any cost in excess of the fixed price under time and material contract we are paid for labor at negotiated hourly billing rate and for certain expense the failure to perform to customer expectation and contract requirement may result in reduced fee or loss and affect our financial performance in that period under each type of contract if we are unable to control cost our operating result could be adversely affected particularly if we are unable to justify an increase in contract value to our customer cost overrun or the failure to perform on existing program also may adversely affect our ability to retain existing program and win future contract award the government is currently pursuing and implementing policy that could negatively impact our profitability change in procurement policy favoring more incentive based fee arrangement different award fee criterion or government contract negotiation offer based upon the customer view of what our cost should be compared to our actual cost may affect the predictability of our profit rate our customer are subject to pressure that may result in change in contract type referenced above earlier in program maturity is traditional an example of this is the use of fixed price incentive fee contract for recent lrip contract on the program while the development contract is being performed concurrently our customer also may pursue non traditional contract provision in negotiation of contract for example change resulting from the development contract may need to be implemented on the production contract including the lrip contract concept referred to concurrency which may require to pay for portion of the concurrency cost in some circumstance the government is proposing position that are inconsistent with the far and existing practice for example the government is requiring that bid and proposal cost be included in general and administrative cost rather than charged directly to contract in certain circumstance another example is recent challenge to overhead cost the government pursuit of policy intended to cause to absorb cost may become more aggressive if the government concludes that our profitability justifies cost shifting without regard to the provision of the far other policy could negatively impact our working capital and cash flow for example contrary to far the government ha expressed preference for requiring progress payment rather than performance based payment on new fixed price contract which if implemented delay our ability to recover significant amount of cost incurred on contract and thus affect the timing of our cash flow increased competition and bid protest in budget constrained environment may make it more difficult to maintain our financial performance and customer relationship we are experiencing increased competition while at the time many of our customer are facing budget pressure trying to do more with le by cutting cost identifying more affordable solution performing certain work internally rather than hiring contractor and reducing product development cycle it is critical we maintain strong customer relationship and seek to understand the priority of their requirement in this price competitive environment in international sale we face substantial competition from both manufacturer and international manufacturer whose government sometimes provide research and development assistance marketing subsidy and other assistance for their product additionally our competitor are also focusing on increasing their international sale to partially mitigate the effect of reduced government budget to remain competitive we consistently must maintain strong customer relationship and provide superior performance advanced technology solution and service at an affordable cost and with the agility that our customer require to satisfy their mission objective substantial portion of our business is awarded through competitive bidding the government increasingly ha relied upon competitive contract award type including indefinite delivery indefinite quantity and other multi award contract which have the potential to create pricing pressure and increase our cost by requiring that we submit multiple bid and proposal in addition multi award contract require that we make sustained effort to obtain task order under the contract the competitive bidding process entail substantial cost and managerial time to prepare bid and proposal for contract that may not be awarded to or may be split among competitor additionally the government may fail to award large competitive contract in an effort to maintain broader industrial base following award we may encounter significant expense delay contract modification or bid protest from unsuccessful bidder on new program award unsuccessful bidder are more frequently protesting in the hope of being awarded subcontract for portion of the work in return for withdrawing the protest bid protest could result in

the cost to satisfy our offset obligation are included in the estimate of our total cost to complete the contract and may impact our profitability and cash flow the ability to recover investment that we make is generally dependent upon the successful operation of venture that we do not control and may involve product and service that are dissimilar to our business activity in these and other situation we could be liable for violation of law for action taken by these entity such law related to anti corruption import and export taxation and anti boycott restriction offset agreement generally extend over several year and may provide for penalty in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirement which are typically subjective and can be outside our control our effort to minimize the likelihood and impact of adverse cyber security incident and to protect data and intellectual property may not be successful and our business could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threat or other disruption we routinely experience various cybersecurity threat threat to our information technology infrastructure unauthorized attempt to gain access to our

defending against such attack additionally we conduct regular periodic training of our employee to the protection of sensitive information which includes training intended to prevent the success of phishing attack we experience similar security threat at customer site that we operate and manage the threat we face vary from attack common to most industry to more advanced and persistent highly organized adversary including nation state which target and other defense contractor because we protect national security information if we are unable to protect sensitive information our customer or governmental authority could question the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection process and procedure and depending on the severity of the incident our customer data our employee data our intellectual property and other third party data such teammate venture partner subcontractor supplier and vendor could be compromised consequence of their persistence sophistication and volume we may not be successful in defending against all such attack due to the evolving nature of these security threat and the national security aspect of much of the data we protect the impact of any future incident can not be predicted in addition to cyber threat we experience threat to the security of our facility and employee and threat from terrorist act do our customer supplier subcontractor venture partner and entity we acquire with whom we typically work cooperatively to seek to minimize the impact of cyber threat other security threat or business disruption however we must rely on the safeguard put in place by these entity well other entity which we do not control who have access to our information and may affect the security of our information these entity have varying level of cybersecurity expertise and safeguard and their relationship with government contractor such lockheed martin may increase the likelihood that they are targeted by the same cyber threat we face we have approximately direct supplier and even more indirect supplier with wide variety of system and cyber security capability and we may not be successful in preventing adversary from exploiting possible weak link in our supply chain we also must rely on this supply chain for detecting and reporting cyber incident and so we may not be successful in reporting or responding to cyber security incident in timely manner the cost related to cyber or other security threat or disruption may not be fully insured or indemnified by other mean additionally some cyber technology we develop under contract for our customer particularly those related to homeland security may raise potential liability related to intellectual property and civil liberty including privacy concern which may not be fully insured

in detecting reporting or responding to cyber incident in timely manner if we fail to manage acquisition divestiture equity investment and other transaction successfully or if acquired entity or equity investment fail to perform expected our financial result business and future prospect could be harmed in pursuing our business strategy we routinely conduct discussion evaluate company and enter into agreement regarding possible acquisition divestiture venture and equity investment we seek to identify acquisition or investment opportunity that will expand or complement our existing

repurchase under maryland law could be limited if our net earnings are le than anticipated we also have no assurance to the timing of any increase in our stockholder equity in addition the timing and

plan asset other actuarial assumption including participant longevity also known mortality and employee turnover well the timing of cash funding change in these factor including actual return on plan asset may also affect our plan funding cash flow and stockholder equity in addition the funding of our plan and recovery of cost on our contract described may also be subject to change caused by legislative or regulatory action with regard to cash flow we make substantial cash contribution to our plan required by the employee retirement income security act of erisa amended by the pension protection act of ppa we generally are able to recover these contribution related to our plan allowable cost on our government contract including fm but there is lag between when we contribute cash to

sustainability program to reduce the effect of our operation on the environment we manage and have managed various government owned facility and portion of government owned facility on behalf of the government at such facility environmental compliance and remediation cost historically have been the responsibility of the government we have relied and continue to rely with respect to past practice upon government funding to pay such cost notwithstanding effort by some government representative to limit this responsibility although the government remains responsible for capital and operating cost associated with environmental compliance responsibility for fine and penalty associated with environmental noncompliance typically is borne by either the government or the contractor depending on the contract and the relevant fact some environmental law include criminal provision an environmental law conviction could affect our ability to be awarded future or perform existing government

maintain qualified workforce many of the product and service we provide are highly engineered and involve sophisticated technology with related complex manufacturing and system integration process our customer requirement change and evolve regularly accordingly our future performance depends in part on our ability to adapt to changing customer need rapidly identify emerging technological trend develop and manufacture innovative product and service and bring those offering to market quickly at cost effective price due to the complex nature of the product and service we offer we may experience technical difficulty during the development of new product or technology these technical difficulty could result in delay and higher cost which may negatively impact our financial result until such product or technology are fully developed additionally there can be no assurance that our developmental project will be successful or meet the need of our customer additionally the possibility exists that our competitor may develop new technology or offering that could cause our existing offering to become obsolete if we fail in our development project or if our new product or technology fail to achieve customer acceptance our ability to procure new contract could be unsuccessful and this could negatively impact our financial result due to the specialized nature of our business our future performance is highly dependent upon our ability to maintain workforce with the requisite skill in multiple area including engineering science manufacturing information technology cybersecurity business development and strategy and management our operating performance is also dependent upon personnel who hold security clearance and receive substantial training in order to work on certain program or task additionally we expand our operation internationally it is increasingly important to hire and retain personnel with relevant experience in local law regulation custom tradition and business practice we face number of challenge that may affect personnel retention such our endeavor to increase the efficiency of our operation and improve the affordability of our product and service such workforce reduction and consolidating and relocating certain operation additionally substantial portion of our workforce are retirement eligible or nearing retirement we previously amended certain of our defined benefit pension plan for non union employee to freeze future retirement benefit the freeze which will be completed january may encourage retirement eligible personnel generally age to elect to retire earlier than anticipated to the extent that we lose experienced personnel it is critical that we develop other employee hire new qualified personnel and successfully manage the transfer of critical knowledge competition for personnel is intense and we may not be successful in hiring or retaining personnel with the requisite skill or clearance we increasingly compete with commercial technology company outside of the aerospace and defense industry for qualified technical cyber and scientific position the number of qualified domestic engineer is decreasing and the number of cyber professional is not keeping with demand to the extent that these company grow at faster rate or face fewer cost and product pricing constraint they may be able to offer more attractive compensation and other benefit to candidate or our existing employee to the extent that the demand for skilled personnel exceeds supply we could experience higher labor recruiting or training cost in order to attract and retain such employee we could experience difficulty in performing our contract if we were unable to do so we also must manage leadership development and succession planning throughout our business while we have process in place for management transition and the transfer of knowledge the loss of key personnel coupled with an inability to adequately train other personnel hire new personnel or transfer knowledge could significantly impact our ability to perform under our contract approximately of our employee are covered by collective bargaining agreement with various union historically where employee are covered by collective bargaining agreement with various union we have been successful in negotiating renewal to expiring agreement without any material disruption of operating activity this doe not assure however that we will be successful in our effort to negotiate renewal of our existing collective bargaining agreement in the future if we encounter difficulty with renegotiations or renewal of collective bargaining arrangement or are unsuccessful in those effort we could incur additional cost and experience work stoppage union action at supplier can also affect any delay or work stoppage of contentscould adversely affect our ability to perform under our contract which could negatively impact our result of operation cash flow and financial condition our estimate and projection may prove to be inaccurate the accounting for some of our most significant activity is based on judgment and estimate which are complex and subject to many variable for example accounting for sale using the percentage of completion method requires that we ass risk and make assumption regarding schedule cost technical and performance issue for each of our thousand of contract many of which are long term in nature additionally we initially allocate the purchase price of acquired business based on preliminary assessment of the fair value of identifiable asset acquired and liability assumed for significant acquisition we may use one year measurement period to analyze and ass number of factor used in establishing the asset and liability fair value of the acquisition date and could result in adjustment to asset and liability balance another example is the billion of goodwill asset recorded on our consolidated balance sheet of december from previous acquisition which represents approximately of our total asset these goodwill asset are subject to annual impairment testing and more frequent testing upon the occurrence of certain event or significant change in circumstance that indicate goodwill may be impaired if we experience change or factor arise that negatively affect the expected cash flow of reporting unit we may be required to write off all or portion of the reporting unit related goodwill asset we acquired sikorsky in november and recorded the asset acquired and liability assumed at fair value result the carrying value and fair value of our sikorsky reporting unit continue to be closely aligned therefore any business deterioration contract cancellation or termination or market pressure could cause our sale earnings and cash flow to decline below current projection and could cause goodwill and intangible asset to be impaired additionally sikorsky may not perform expected or demand for it product may be adversely affected by global economic condition including oil and gas trend that are outside of our control future change in or foreign tax law including those with retroactive effect and audit by tax authority could result in unanticipated increase in our tax expense and affect profitability and cash flow the amount of net deferred tax asset will change periodically based on several factor including the measurement of our postretirement benefit plan obligation actual cash contribution to our postretirement benefit plan and future change in tax law actual financial result could differ from our

both and international customer with product and service that have defense civil and commercial application with our principal customer being agency of the government in of our billion in net sale were from the government either prime contractor or subcontractor including from the department of defense dod were from international customer including foreign military sale fm contracted through the government and were from commercial and other customer our main area of focus are in defense space intelligence homeland security and information technology including cybersecurity we operate in four business segment aeronautics missile and fire control mfc rotary and mission system rms and space previously known space system we organize our business segment based on the nature of the product and service offered we operate in an environment characterized by both increasing complexity in global security and continuing economic pressure in the and globally significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on program execution improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our product and service and placing security capability quickly into the hand

significant accounting policy under the caption recent accounting pronouncement included in our note to consolidated financial statement for further discussion we expect net sale will increase in the low single digit range from level the projected growth is driven by increased production and sustainment volume on the program at aeronautics well increased volume in tactical missile program at mfc partially offset by decreased volume at rms and space segment operating profit is expected to increase in the mid single digit range from level primarily driven by improved performance at rms accordingly we expect that segment operating profit margin will slightly increase over our margin of our outlook for assumes the government continues to support and fund our key program consistent with the government fiscal year gfy budget change in circumstance may require to revise our assumption which could materially change our current estimate of net sale and operating profit margin for additional information related to trend in net sale and operating profit at our business segment see the business segment result of operation discussion below we expect the net fa ca pension benefit to be approximately billion assuming discount rate basis point decrease from the end of an approximately return on plan asset in basis point increase from the expected rate of return at the end of and expected long term rate of return on plan asset in future year and the revised longevity assumption released on october by the society of actuary we will make contribution of billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plan in including required and discretionary contribution result of these contribution we do not expect any material qualified defined benefit cash funding will be required until we plan to fund these contribution using mix of cash on hand and commercial paper while we do not anticipate need to do so our capital structure and resource would allow to issue new debt if circumstance change see capital structure resource and other discussion below result of adopting asu no we expect to present reclassification of non service fa net periodic benefit cost for all postretirement benefit plan including the qualified defined benefit pension plan of approximately million for the fiscal year from consolidated operating profit to other non operating income net on our consolidated statement of earnings this reclassification ha no impact on our total business segment operating profit or consolidated net earnings business segment financial trendsaeronauticswe expect aeronautics net sale to increase in the mid single digit percentage range compared to driven by increased production and sustainment volume on the program operating profit is expected to

training and logistics service and integrated warfare system and sensor iw line of business operating profit is expected to increase in the low double digit percentage range driven by performance improvement in the iw and and undersea system and sensor line of business operating profit margin are also expected to improve from level spacewe expect space net sale to decrease in the mid single

comparable to result operating profit margin is expected to increase slightly from level portfolio shaping activity we continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of product and service to meet the current and future need of our customer we accomplish this in part by our independent research and development activity and through acquisition divestiture and internal realignment activity we selectively pursue the acquisition of business and investment at attractive valuation that will expand or complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customer or technology we also may explore the divestiture of business that no longer meet our need or strategy or that could perform better outside of our organization in pursuing our business strategy we routinely conduct discussion evaluate target and enter into agreement regarding possible acquisition divestiture venture and equity investment divestiture of the information system global solution business on august we divested our former information system global solution is business which merged with leidos holding inc leidos in reverse morris trust transaction the transaction the transaction wa completed in multi step process pursuant to which we initially contributed the is business to abacus innovation corporation abacus wholly owned subsidiary of lockheed martin created to facilitate the transaction and the common stock of abacus wa distributed to participating lockheed martin stockholder through an exchange offer under the term of the exchange offer lockheed martin stockholder had the option to exchange share of lockheed martin common stock for share of abacus common stock at the conclusion of the exchange offer all share of abacus common stock were exchanged for share of lockheed martin common stock

our common stock outstanding by approximately following the exchange offer abacus merged with subsidiary of leidos with abacus continuing the surviving corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of leidos part of the merger each share of abacus common stock wa automatically converted into one share of leidos common stock we not receive any share of leidos common stock part of the transaction and do not hold any share of leidos or abacus common stock following the transaction based on an opinion of outside tax counsel subject to customary qualification and based on factual representation the exchange offer and merger will qualify tax free transaction to lockheed martin and it stockholder except to the extent that cash wa paid to lockheed martin stockholder in lieu of fractional share in connection with the transaction abacus borrowed an aggregate principal amount of approximately billion under term loan facility with third party financial institution the proceeds of which were used to make one time special cash payment of billion to lockheed martin and to pay associated borrowing fee and expense the entire special cash payment wa used to repay debt pay dividend and repurchase stock during the third and fourth quarter of the obligation under the abacus term loan facility were guaranteed by leidos part of the transaction result of the transaction we recognized net gain of

exchange offer plus the billion one time special cash payment le the net book value of the is business of about billion at august and other adjustment of about million during the fourth quarter of we recognized an additional gain of million which reflects certain post closing adjustment including certain tax adjustment and the final determination of net working capital we classified the operating result of our former is business discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statement in accordance with gaap the divestiture of this business represented strategic shift that had major effect on our operation and financial result however the cash flow generated by the is business have not been reclassified in our consolidated statement of cash flow we retained this cash part of the

acquisition other on august we increased our ownership interest in the awe management limited awe joint venture which operates the united kingdom nuclear deterrent program from to at which time we began consolidating awe consequently our operating result include of awe sale and of it operating profit prior to increasing our ownership interest we accounted for our investment in awe using the equity method of accounting under the equity method we recognized only of awe earnings or loss and no sale accordingly prior to august the date we obtained control we recorded of awe net earnings in our operating result and subsequent to august we recognized of awe sale and of it operating profit for additional information see note acquisition and divestiture included in our note to consolidated financial statement industry considerationsu government funding the government ha not yet passed an appropriation bill for fiscal year the government fiscal year begin on october and end on september however on december the government passed continuing resolution funding measure to finance all government activity through january congress wa unable to reach an agreement to continue to fund the government prior to midnight on january and the government wa forced to shut for three day on january the government passed continuing resolution funding measure to finance all government activity through february under this continuing resolution partial year funding at amount consistent with appropriated level for fiscal year are available subject to certain restriction but new spending initiative are not authorized our key program continue to be supported and funded despite the continuing resolution financing mechanism however during period covered by continuing resolution or until the regular appropriation bill are passed we may experience delay in procurement of product and service due to lack of funding and those delay may affect our result of operation in may the president submitted budget proposal for gfy to congress which includes base budget for the dod of billion approximately billion above the spending limit established under the budget control act of the budget control act described below and an increase of billion over the fiscal year funding level the president budget request also includes funding of billion for overseas contingency operation oco global war on terror gwot which is not subject to the budget control act spending limit congress must approve or revise the president gfy budget proposal through enactment of appropriation bill and other policy legislation which would then require final presidential approval of contentsin december the president signed the gfy national defense authorization act ndaa into law the ndaa authorizes funding level for the agency responsible for defense and set forth how the fund will be used the ndaa authorizes billion in base defense spending billion for dod and billion in oco fund exceeding the budget control act limit for base defense spending by billion the oco account is exempt from the budget control act it remains uncertain when an appropriation bill for fiscal year will be enacted or at what level currently defense spending through fiscal year remains subject to statutory spending limit established by the budget control act the spending limit were modified for fiscal year through by the american taxpayer relief act of the bipartisan budget act of and the bipartisan budget act of however these act did not provide relief to the spending limit beyond fiscal year if congress approves the president budget proposal or other appropriation legislation with funding level that exceed the spending limit automatic across the board spending reduction known sequestration would be triggered to reduce funding back to the spending limit currently enacted the budget control act limit defense spending to billion approximately billion for dod for fiscal year with modest increase of about per year through the president budget proposal well defense budget estimate for fiscal year and beyond exceed the spending limit established by the budget control act result continued budget uncertainty and the risk of future sequestration cut remain unless the budget control act is repealed or significantly modified the investment and acquisition we have made in recent year have sought to align our business with what we believe are the most critical national priority and mission area however the possibility remains that our program could be materially reduced extended or terminated result of the government continuing assessment of priority change in government priority the implementation of sequestration particularly in those circumstance where sequestration is implemented across the board without regard to national priority or other budget cut in lieu of sequestration on september congress passed legislation suspending the debt ceiling through december on december the debt limit wa increased to the amount of debt the government held outstanding on that date however despite using cash on hand and measure employed by the department of treasury the debt ceiling is expected to be reached in early congress will need to raise the debt limit for the government to continue borrowing money before these measure are exhausted if the debt ceiling is not raised the government may not be able to pay for expenditure or fulfill it funding obligation and there could be significant disruption to all discretionary program we anticipate there will continue to be significant amount of debate and negotiation within the government over defense spending and the debt ceiling in the context of these negotiation it is possible that existing cut to government program could be kept in place replaced with different spending cut and or replaced with package of broader reform to reduce the federal deficit however we continue to believe that our portfolio of product and service will continue to be well supported in strategically focused allocation of budget resource international businessa key component of our strategic plan is to grow our international sale to accomplish this growth we continue to focus on strengthening our relationship internationally through partnership and joint technology effort we conduct business with international customer through each of our

million result of our decision to accelerate contribution to our pension fund in in order to receive tax deduction in while we have substantially completed our provisional analysis of the income tax effect of the tax act and recorded reasonable estimate of such effect the net one time charge related to the tax act may differ possibly materially due to among other thing further refinement of our

unfunded backlog firm order for which funding ha not yet been appropriated backlog doe not include unexercised option or task order to be issued under indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract funded backlog wa approximately billion at december of contentsmanagement evaluates performance on our contract by focusing on net sale and operating profit and not by type or amount of operating expense consequently our discussion of business segment performance focus on net sale and operating profit consistent with our approach for managing the business this approach is consistent throughout the life cycle of our contract management ass the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sale and operating profit and monitor performance on our contract in similar manner through their completion we regularly provide customer with report of our cost the contract progress the cost information in the report is accumulated in manner specified by the requirement of each contract for example cost data provided to customer for product would typically align to the subcomponents of that product such wing box on an aircraft and for service would align to the type of work being performed such aircraft sustainment our contract generally allow for the recovery of cost in the pricing of our product and service most of our contract are bid and negotiated with our customer under circumstance in which we are required to disclose our estimated total cost to provide the product or service this approach for negotiating contract with our government customer generally allows for the recovery of our cost we also may enter into long term supply contract for certain material or component to coincide with the production schedule of certain product and to ensure their availability at known unit price many of our contract span several year and include highly complex technical requirement at the outset of contract we identify and monitor risk to the achievement of the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract and ass the effect of those risk on our estimate of total cost to complete the contract the estimate consider the technical requirement newly developed product versus mature product the schedule and associated task the number and type of milestone event and cost material labor subcontractor overhead and the estimated cost to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreement required under certain contract with international customer the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risk surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirement schedule and cost in the initial estimated total cost to complete the contract profit booking rate may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risk surrounding the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract which decrease the estimated total cost to complete the contract conversely our profit booking rate may decrease if the estimated total cost to complete the contract increase all of the estimate are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate we have number of program that are designated classified by the government which can not be specifically described the operating result of these classified program are included in our consolidated and business segment result and are subjected to the same oversight and internal control our other program our net sale are primarily derived from long term contract for product and service provided to the government well fm contracted through the government we account for these contract well product contract with non government customer using the percentage of completion method of accounting which represent substantially all of our net sale we derive our remaining net sale from contract to provide service to non government customer which we account for under the service method of accounting under the percentage of completion method of accounting we record sale on contract based upon our progress towards completion on particular contract well our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion cost reimbursable contract provide for the payment of allowable cost plus fee for fixed priced contract net sale and cost of sale are recognized product are delivered or cost are incurred due to the nature of the percentage of completion method of accounting change in our cost of sale are typically accompanied by related change in our net sale change in net sale and operating profit generally are expressed in term of volume change in volume refer to increase or decrease in sale or operating profit resulting from varying production activity level delivery or service level on individual contract volume change in segment operating profit are typically based on the current profit booking rate for particular contract in addition comparability of our segment sale operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by change in profit booking rate on our contract accounted for using the percentage of completion method of accounting increase in the profit booking rate typically referred to risk retirement usually relate to revision in the estimated total cost that reflect improved condition on particular contract conversely condition on particular contract may deteriorate resulting in an increase in the estimated total cost to complete and reduction in the profit booking rate increase or decrease in profit booking rate are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception to date effect of such change segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other item favorable item may include the positive resolution of contractual matter cost recovery on restructuring charge insurance recovery and gain on sale of asset unfavorable item may include the adverse resolution of contractual matter restructuring charge except for significant severance action which are excluded from segment operating result reserve for dispute asset impairment and loss on sale of certain asset segment operating profit and item such risk retirement reduction of profit booking rate or other matter are presented net of state income tax of contentsas previously disclosed we have program to design integrate and install an air missile defense system for an international customer that ha experienced performance issue and for which we have periodically accrued reserve in we revised our estimated cost to complete the program eadge consequence of ongoing performance matter and recorded an additional charge of million million or per share after tax at our rms business segment of december cumulative loss including reserve remained at approximately million on this program we are continuing to monitor the viability of the program and the available option and could record additional charge in future period however based on the reserve already accrued and our current estimate of the cost to complete the program at this time we do not anticipate that additional charge if any would be material we have two commercial satellite program at our space business segment for which we have experienced performance issue related to the development and integration of modernized lm satellite platform these commercial program require the development of new satellite technology to enhance the lm power propulsion and electronics among other item the enhanced satellite is expected to benefit other commercial and government satellite program we have periodically revised our estimated cost to complete these developmental commercial program we have recorded cumulative loss of approximately million of december including approximately million million or per share after tax recorded during the year ended december while these loss reflect our estimated total loss on the program we will continue to incur unrecovered cost each period until we complete these program and may have to record additional loss reserve in future period which could be material to our operating result while we do not currently anticipate recording additional loss reserve the program remain developmental and further challenge in the delivery and integration of new satellite technology anomaly discovered during system testing requiring repair or rework further schedule delay and potential penalty could require that we record additional reserve we do not currently expect to be able to meet the delivery schedule under the contract and have informed the customer the customer could seek to exercise termination right under the contract in which case we would have to refund the payment we have received and pay certain penalty however we think the probability that the customer will seek to exercise any termination right is remote the delay beyond the termination date is modest and the customer have an immediate need for the satellite

when they arise consistent with that strategy we have continued to invest in our business including capital expenditure independent research and development and made selective business acquisition while returning cash to stockholder through dividend and share repurchase and managing our debt level maturity and interest rate we have generated strong operating cash flow which have been the primary source of funding for our operation capital expenditure debt service and repayment dividend share repurchase and postretirement benefit plan contribution our strong operating cash flow enabled our board of director to approve two key cash deployment initiative in september first we increased our fourth quarter dividend rate by to per share second the board of director approved billion increase to our share repurchase program inclusive of this increase the total remaining authorization for future common share repurchase under our program wa billion of december during we received one time tax free special cash payment of approximately billion result of the divestiture of the is business in the third quarter of we used the proceeds to repay million of long term note at their scheduled maturity and paid million in dividend with portion of this cash the remainder wa used for share repurchase we have accessed the capital market opportunistically we did in february when we issued billion of long term debt and needed we did in november when we issued billion of long term debt in connection with our acquisition of sikorsky we also used combination of short term debt financing commercial paper and available cash to fund the sikorsky acquisition discussed below in capital structure resource and other and note debt included in our note to consolidated financial statement we expect our cash from operation will continue to be sufficient to support our operation and anticipated capital expenditure for the foreseeable future we also have access to credit market if needed for liquidity or general corporate purpose including but not limited to our revolving credit facility or the ability to issue commercial paper and letter of credit to support customer advance payment and for other trade finance purpose such guaranteeing our performance on particular contract see our capital structure resource and other section below for discussion on financial resource available to we will make contribution of billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plan in including required and discretionary contribution result of these contribution we do not expect any material qualified defined benefit cash funding of contentswill be required until we plan to fund these contribution and manage the timing of cash flow in using mix of cash on hand and commercial paper while we do not anticipate need to do so our capital structure and resource would allow to issue new debt if circumstance change cash received from customer either from the payment of invoice for work performed or for advance in excess of cost incurred is our primary source of cash we generally do not begin work on contract until funding is appropriated by the customer however we may determine to fund customer program ourselves pending government appropriation and are doing so with increased frequency if we incur cost in excess of fund obligated on the contract we may be at risk for reimbursement of the excess cost billing timetable and payment term on our contract vary based on number of factor including the contract type we generally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost reimbursable and time and material contract which together represents approximately of the sale we recorded in we are authorized to bill the cost are incurred or work is performed number of our fixed price contract may provide for performance based payment which allow to bill and collect cash we perform on the contract the amount of performance based payment and the related milestone are encompassed in the negotiation of each contract the timing of such payment may differ from our incurrence of cost related to our contract performance thereby affecting our cash flow the government ha indicated that it would consider progress payment the baseline for negotiating payment term on fixed price contract rather than performance based payment in contrast to negotiated performance based payment term progress payment provision correspond to percentage of the amount of cost incurred during the performance of the contract while the total amount of cash collected on contract is the same performance based payment have had more favorable impact on the timing of our cash flow in addition our cash flow may be affected if the government decides to withhold payment on our billing while the impact of withholding payment delay the receipt of cash the cumulative amount of cash collected during the life of the contract will not vary the majority of our capital expenditure for and those planned for are for equipment facility infrastructure and information technology expenditure for equipment and facility infrastructure are generally incurred to support new and existing program across all of our business segment for example we have project underway in our aeronautics business segment for facility and equipment to support higher production of the combat aircraft and we have project underway to modernize certain of our facility we also incur capital expenditure for information technology to support program and general enterprise information

cash used for provided by financing activity change in cash and cash equivalent cash and cash equivalent at end of year compared to net cash provided by operating activity increased billion in compared to primarily due to decrease in cash used for working capital reduction in cash paid for income tax and reduction in cash paid for severance the change in working capital is defined receivables and inventory le account payable and customer advance and amount in excess of cost incurred the change in working capital wa largely driven by timing of cash receipt for account receivable primarily pac thaad lantirn and sniper and sikorsky helicopter program and lower inventory we made net income tax of contentspayments of billion and billion during the year ended december and our

part of the divestiture we will make contribution of billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plan in for discussion of future postretirement benefit plan funding see critical accounting policy postretirement benefit plan under the caption funding consideration compared to net cash provided by operating activity increased million in compared to primarily due to reduction in cash paid for income tax partially offset by an increase in cash paid for interest expense and an increase in cash used for working capital the million increase in cash flow used for working capital defined receivables and inventory le account payable and customer advance and amount in excess of cost incurred wa attributable to timing of cash receipt for receivables primarily program partially offset by timing of production and billing cycle affecting customer advance and progress payment applied to inventory primarily program we made net income tax payment of billion and billion during the year ended december and respectively we made interest payment of approximately million and million during the year ended december and respectively in addition cash provided by operating activity during the year ended december and included cash generated by is of approximately million and approximately million we retained this cash part of the divestiture investing activitiesnet cash used for investing activity increased million in compared to primarily due to higher capital expenditure and cash proceeds received in the prior year related to property sold net cash used for investing activity decreased billion in compared to primarily due to billion of cash used for acquisition activity in that did not recur in acquisition activity include both the acquisition of business and investment in affiliate we had no significant cash acquisition in and in we paid billion for the sikorsky acquisition net of cash acquired see note acquisition and divestiture included in our note to consolidated financial statement capital expenditure amounted to billion in billion in and million in the majority of our capital expenditure were for equipment and facility infrastructure that generally are incurred to support new and existing program across all of our business segment we also incur capital expenditure for information technology to support program and general enterprise information technology infrastructure inclusive of cost for the development or purchase of internal use software additionally in we received cash proceeds of approximately million related to three property sold in california financing activitiesnet cash used for financing activity increased million in compared to primarily due to the receipt of one time special cash payment in from the divestiture of the is business and higher dividend payment in partially offset by the repayment of long term debt in and reduction in cash used for repurchase of common stock net cash used for financing activity increased billion in compared to primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of long term debt in which did not recur in the repayment of long term debt in and higher dividend payment partially offset by the proceeds from the one time special cash payment of billion from the divestiture of the is business and reduction in cash used for repurchase of common stock in may we repaid million of long term note with fixed interest rate of according to their scheduled maturity in september we repaid million of long term note with fixed interest rate of according to their scheduled maturity in february we

obligation to subcontractor and outsourcing arrangement total purchase obligation for operating activity in the preceding table include approximately billion related to contractual commitment entered into result of contract we have with our government customer the government generally would be required to pay for any cost we incur relative to these commitment if they were to terminate the related contract for convenience under the federal acquisition regulation far subject to available funding this also would be true in case where we perform subcontract work for prime contractor under government contract the termination for convenience language also may be included in contract with foreign state and local government we also have contract with customer that do not include termination for convenience provision including contract with commercial customer purchase obligation in the preceding table for capital expenditure generally include facility infrastructure equipment and information technology we also may enter into industrial cooperation agreement sometimes referred to offset agreement condition to obtaining order for our product and service from certain customer in foreign country these agreement are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country offset agreement may be satisfied through activity that do not require to use cash including transferring technology providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in country project and the purchase by third party our vendor of supply from in country vendor these agreement also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activity purchasing supply from in country vendor providing financial support for in country project establishment of venture with local company and building or leasing facility for in country operation we typically do not commit to offset agreement until order for our product or service are definitive the amount ultimately applied against our offset agreement are based on negotiation with the customer and typically require cash outlay that represent only fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement satisfaction of our offset obligation are included in the estimate of our total cost to complete the contract and may impact our sale profitability and cash flow our ability to recover investment on our consolidated balance sheet that we make to satisfy offset obligation is generally dependent upon the successful operation of venture that we do not control and may involve product and service that are dissimilar to our business activity at december the notional value of remaining obligation under our outstanding offset agreement totaled approximately billion which primarily relate to our aeronautics mfc and rms business segment most of which extend through to the extent we have entered into purchase or other obligation at december that also satisfy offset agreement those amount are included in the preceding table offset program usually extend over several year and may provide for penalty estimated at approximately billion at december in the of contentsevent we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirement while historically we have not been required to pay material penalty resolution of offset requirement are often the result of negotiation and subjective judgment in connection with our ownership interest of ula we and the boeing company boeing are required to provide ula an additional capital contribution if ula is unable to make required payment under it inventory supply agreement with boeing of december ula total remaining obligation to boeing under the inventory supply agreement wa million the party have agreed to defer the remaining payment obligation it is more than offset by other commitment to ula accordingly we do not expect to be required to make capital contribution to ula under this agreement in addition both we and boeing have cross indemnified each other for guarantee by and boeing of the performance and financial obligation of ula under certain launch service contract we believe ula will be able to fully perform it obligation it ha done through december and that it will not be necessary to make payment under the cross indemnity or guarantee we have entered into standby letter of credit and surety bond issued on our behalf by financial institution and other directly issued guarantee to third party primarily relating to advance received from customer and the guarantee of future performance on certain contract letter of credit and surety bond generally are available for draw down in the event we do not perform in some case we may guarantee the contractual performance of third party such venture partner at december we had the following outstanding letter of credit surety bond and third party guarantee in million commitment expiration by period total commitment le year and and after year standby letter of credit bond third party guarantee commitment approximately million of standby letter of credit in the le than year category million in the year and category and million in the year and category are expected to renew for additional period until completion of the contractual obligation at december third party guarantee totaled million of which approximately related to guarantee of contractual performance of venture to which we currently are or previously were party this amount represents our estimate of the maximum amount we would expect to incur upon the contractual non performance of the venture venture partner or divested business generally we also have cross indemnity in place that may enable to recover amount that may be paid on behalf of venture partner in determining our exposure we evaluate the reputation performance on contractual obligation technical capability and credit quality of our current and former venture partner and the transferee under novation agreement all of which include guarantee required by the far there were no material amount recorded in our financial statement related to third party guarantee or novation agreement critical accounting policiescontract accounting sale recognition substantially all of our net sale are accounted for using the percentage of completion method which requires that significant estimate and assumption be made in accounting for the contract our remaining net sale are derived from contract to provide service to non government customer which we account for under service accounting model we evaluate new or significantly modified contract with customer other than the government to the extent the contract include multiple element to determine if the individual deliverable should be accounted for separate unit of accounting when we determine that accounting for the deliverable separate unit is appropriate we allocate the contract value to the deliverable based on their relative estimated selling price the contract or contract modification we evaluate for multiple element typically are long term in nature and include the provision of both product and service based on the nature of our business we generally account for component of such contract using the percentage of completion accounting model or the service accounting model appropriate of contentswe classify net sale product or service on our consolidated statement of earnings based on the predominant attribute of the underlying contract most of our long term contract are denominated in dollar including contract for sale of military product and service to international government contracted through the government contract type our contract generally record sale for both product and service under fixed price cost reimbursable and time and material contract fixed price contractsunder fixed price contract which accounted for about and of our total net sale in and we agree to perform the specified work for pre determined price to the extent our actual cost vary from the estimate upon which the price wa negotiated we will generate more or le profit or could incur loss some fixed price contract have performance based component under which we may earn incentive payment or incur financial penalty based on our performance cost reimbursable contract cost reimbursable contract which accounted for about and of our total net sale in and provide for the payment of allowable cost incurred during performance of the contract plus fee up to ceiling based on the amount that ha been funded we generate revenue under two general type of cost reimbursable contract cost plus award fee incentive fee contract which represent substantial majority of our cost reimbursable contract and cost plus fixed fee contract cost plus award fee contract provide for an award fee that varies within specified limit based on the customer assessment of our performance against predetermined set of criterion such target based on cost quality technical and schedule criterion cost plus incentive fee contract provide for reimbursement of cost plus fee which is adjusted by formula based on the relationship of total allowable cost to total target cost incentive based on cost or reimbursement of cost plus an incentive to exceed stated performance target incentive based on performance the fixed fee in cost plus fixed fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed fee doe not vary with actual cost percentage of completion method we record net sale and estimated profit for substantially all of our contract using the percentage of completion method for fixed price and cost reimbursable contract for product and service with the government the percentage of completion method for product contract depends on the nature of the product provided under the contract for example for contract that require to perform significant level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract and or to deliver minimal quantity sale are recorded using the cost to cost method to measure progress toward completion under the cost to cost method of accounting we recognize sale and an estimated profit cost are incurred based on the proportion that the incurred cost bear to total estimated cost for contract that require to provide substantial number of similar item without significant level of development we record sale and an estimated profit on percentage of completion basis using unit of delivery the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract for contract to provide service to the government sale are generally recorded using the cost to cost method award and incentive fee well penalty related to contract performance are considered in estimating sale and profit rate on contract accounted for under the percentage of completion method estimate of award fee are based on past experience and anticipated performance we record incentive or penalty when there is sufficient information to ass anticipated contract performance incentive provision that increase or decrease earnings based solely on single significant event are not recognized until the event occurs accounting for contract using the percentage of completion method requires judgment relative to assessing risk estimating contract sale and cost including estimating award and incentive fee and penalty related to performance and making assumption for schedule and technical issue due to the number of year it may take to complete many of our contract and the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on those contract the estimation of total sale and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variable and accordingly is subject to change when adjustment in estimated total contract sale or estimated total cost are required any change from prior estimate are recognized in the current period for the inception to date effect of such change our estimate of cost at completion of the contract are based on assumption we make for variable such labor productivity and availability the complexity of the work to be performed the availability of material the length of time to complete the contract to estimate increase in wage and price for material performance by our subcontractor and the availability and of contentstiming of funding from our customer among other variable when estimate of total cost to be incurred on contract exceed estimate of total sale to be earned provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined many of our contract span several year and include highly complex technical requirement at the outset of contract we identify and monitor risk to the achievement of the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract and ass the effect of those risk on our estimate of total cost to complete the contract the estimate consider the technical requirement newly developed product versus mature product the schedule and associated task the number and type of milestone event and cost material labor subcontractor overhead and the estimated cost to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreement sometimes referred to offset agreement required under certain contract with international customer the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risk surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirement schedule and cost in the initial estimated total cost to complete the contract profit booking rate may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risk surrounding the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract which decrease the estimated total cost to complete the contract conversely our profit booking rate may decrease if the estimated total cost to complete the contract increase all of the estimate are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate in addition comparability of our business segment sale operating profit and operating margin may be impacted by change in profit booking rate on our contract accounted for using the percentage of completion method of accounting increase in the profit booking rate typically referred to risk retirement usually relate to revision in the estimated total cost that reflect improved condition on particular contract conversely condition on particular contract may deteriorate resulting in an increase in the estimated total cost to complete and reduction in the profit booking rate increase or decrease in profit booking rate are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception to date effect of such change segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other item favorable item may include the positive resolution of contractual matter cost recovery on restructuring charge insurance recovery and gain on sale of asset unfavorable item may include the adverse resolution of contractual matter restructuring charge except for significant severance action such those mentioned in note restructuring charge included in our note to consolidated financial statement which are excluded from segment operating result reserve for dispute asset impairment and loss on sale of certain asset segment operating profit and item such risk retirement reduction of profit booking rate or other matter are presented net of state income tax service method under fixed price service contract we are paid predetermined fixed amount for specified scope of work and generally have full responsibility for the cost associated with the contract and the resulting profit or loss we record net sale under fixed price service contract with non government customer on straight line basis over the period of contract performance unless evidence suggests that net sale are earned or the obligation are fulfilled in different pattern for cost reimbursable contract for service to non government customer we record net sale service are performed except for award and incentive fee award and incentive fee are recorded when they are fixed or determinable generally at the date the amount is communicated to by the customer this approach result in the recognition of such fee at contractual interval typically every six month throughout the contract and is dependent on the customer process for notification of award and issuance of formal notification cost for all service contract are expensed incurred other contract accounting considerationsthe majority of our sale are driven by pricing based on cost incurred to produce product or perform service under contract with the government cost based pricing is determined under the far the far provides guidance on the type of cost that are allowable in establishing price for good and service under government contract for example cost such those related to charitable contribution interest expense and certain advertising and public relation activity are unallowable and therefore not recoverable through sale in addition we may enter into advance agreement with the government that address the subject of allowability and allocability of cost to contract for specific matter for example most of the environmental cost we incur for environmental remediation related to site operated in prior year are allocated to our current operation general and administrative cost under far provision and supporting advance agreement reached with the government we closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policy related to contract accounting cost incurred and allocated to contract are reviewed for compliance with government regulation by our personnel and are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency of contentsnew accounting pronouncementon january we adopted asu no revenue from contract with customer amended topic commonly referred to asc which will change the way we recognize revenue and significantly expand the disclosure requirement for revenue arrangement we adopted the requirement of the new standard on the effective date of january using the full retrospective transition method whereby asc will be applied to each prior year presented and the cumulative effect of applying asc will be recognized at january the beginning of the earliest year presented for additional information regarding our adoption of asc see note significant accounting policy included in our note to consolidated financial statement under the caption recent accounting pronouncement postretirement benefit plansoverviewmany of our employee participate in qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plan retiree medical and life insurance plan and other postemployment plan collectively postretirement benefit plan see note postretirement benefit plan included in our note to consolidated financial statement the majority of our accrued benefit obligation relate to our qualified defined benefit pension plan and retiree medical and life insurance plan we recognize on plan by plan basis the net funded status of these postretirement benefit plan under gaap either an asset or liability on our consolidated balance sheet the gaap funded status represents the difference between the fair value of each plan asset and the benefit obligation of the plan the gaap benefit obligation represents the present value of the estimated future benefit we currently expect to pay to plan participant based on past service in june we amended certain of our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plan for non union employee comprising the majority of our benefit obligation to freeze future retirement benefit the calculation of retirement benefit under the affected defined benefit pension plan is determined by formula that take into account the participant year of credited service and average compensation the freeze will take effect in two stage on january the pay based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefit wa frozen so that future pay increase annual incentive bonus or other amount earned for or related to period after december are not used to calculate retirement benefit on january the service based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefit will also be frozen so that participant will no longer earn further credited service for any period after december when the freeze is complete the majority of our salaried employee will have transitioned to an enhanced defined contribution retirement saving plan notwithstanding these action the impact of these plan and benefit on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record and the funded status for our postretirement benefit plan may materially change from year to year because those calculation are sensitive to funding level well change in several key economic assumption including interest rate actual rate of return on plan asset and other actuarial assumption including participant longevity and employee turnover well the timing of cash funding actuarial assumptionsthe plan asset and benefit obligation are measured at the end of each year or more frequently upon the occurrence of certain event such significant plan amendment settlement or curtailment the amount we record are measured using actuarial valuation which are dependent upon key assumption such discount rate the expected long term rate of return on plan asset participant longevity employee turnover and the health care cost trend rate for our retiree medical plan the assumption we make affect both the calculation of the benefit obligation of the measurement date and the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in subsequent period when reassessing these assumption we consider past and current market condition and make judgment about future market trend we also consider factor such the timing and amount of expected contribution to the plan and benefit payment to plan participant we continue to use single weighted average discount rate approach when calculating our consolidated benefit obligation related to our defined benefit pension plan resulting in at december compared to at december and at december we utilized single weighted average discount rate of when calculating our benefit obligation related to our retiree medical and life insurance plan at december compared to at december and at december we evaluate several data point in order to arrive at an appropriate single weighted average discount rate including result from cash flow model quoted rate from long term bond index and change in long term bond rate over the past year part of our evaluation we calculate the approximate average yield on corporate bond rated aa or better selected to match our projected postretirement benefit plan cash flow of contentswe utilized an expected long term rate of return on plan asset of at both december and december compared to at december we reduced our expected long term rate of return assumption in due to downward pressure on the equity and fixed income asset class in our trust an increasingly aging population and debt burden place downward pressure on already low interest rate and economic growth suggesting the future return for our fixed income may be lower than historical norm surge in equity since have led to high valuation of the equity market suggesting the forward return may also be lower than historical norm the long term rate of return assumption represents the expected long term rate of return on the fund invested or to be invested to provide for the benefit included in the benefit obligation this assumption is based on several factor including historical market index return the anticipated long term allocation of plan asset the historical return data for the trust fund plan expense and the potential to outperform market index return the difference between the long term rate of return on plan asset assumption we select and the actual return on plan asset in any given year affect both the funded status of our benefit plan and the calculation of fa pension expense in subsequent period although the actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption the average expected return over long term future horizon should be approximately equal to the assumption any variance in given year should not by suggest that the assumption should be changed pattern of variance are reviewed over time and then combined with expectation for the future result change in this assumption are le frequent than change in the discount rate in both october and the society of actuary published revised longevity assumption that refined it prior study we used the revised assumption indicating shortened longevity in our december and december re measurement of benefit obligation the publication were refinement to assumption the society of actuary published in previous year beginning in our stockholder equity ha been reduced cumulatively by billion from the annual year end measurement of the funded status of postretirement benefit plan the cumulative non cash after tax reduction primarily represents net actuarial loss resulting from decline in discount rate investment loss and updated longevity market related value of our plan asset determined using actual asset gain or loss over the prior three year period is used to calculate the amount of deferred asset gain or loss to be amortized these cumulative actuarial loss will be amortized to expense using the corridor method where gain and loss are recognized to the extent they exceed of the greater of plan asset or benefit obligation over the average future service period of employee expected to receive benefit under the plan of approximately nine year of december this amortization period is expected to extend approximately double in when our non union pension plan are completely frozen to use the average remaining life expectancy of the participant instead of average future service during million of these amount wa recognized component of postretirement benefit plan expense and about billion is expected to be recognized expense in the discount rate and long term rate of return on plan asset assumption we select at the end of each year are based on our best estimate and judgment change of plus or minus basis point in the discount rate assumption at december with all other assumption held constant would have decreased or increased the amount of the qualified pension benefit obligation we recorded at the end of by approximately billion which would result in an after tax increase or decrease in stockholder equity at the end of the year of approximately billion if the discount rate at december that wa used to compute the expected fa pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plan had been basis point higher or lower with all other assumption held constant the amount of fa pension expense projected for would be lower or higher by approximately million if the expected long term rate of return on plan asset assumption at december that wa used to compute the expected fa pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plan had been basis point higher or lower with all other assumption held constant the amount of fa pension expense projected for would be lower or higher by approximately million each year difference between the actual plan asset return and the expected long term rate of return on plan asset impact the measurement of the following year fa expense every basis point difference in return during between our actual rate of return of approximately and our expected long term rate of return of impacted expected fa pension expense by approximately million funding considerationsthere were no material contribution to our qualified defined benefit pension plan in and funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plan is determined in manner consistent with ca and in accordance with the employee retirement income security act of erisa amended by the pension protection act of ppa our goal ha been to fund the pension plan to level of at least determined under the ppa the erisa funded status is calculated on different basis than under gaap result of the moving ahead for progress in the century act of map which included provision that changed the methodology for calculating the interest rate assumption used in determining the minimum funding requirement under the ppa there wa an increase in the interest rate assumption which in turn lowered the minimum funding requirement on august the highway and transportation funding act of hatfa wa enacted and on november the bipartisan budget act of which extend the methodology put in place by map to calculate the of contentsinterest rate assumption so that the impact will begin to decrease in and phase out by this ha the effect of lowering our minimum funding requirement during the affected period from what they otherwise would have been the erisa funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plan wa about and of december and the gaap funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plan wa about and at december and contribution to our defined benefit pension plan are recovered over time through the pricing of our product and service on government contract including fm and are recognized in our cost of sale and net sale ca govern the extent to which our pension cost are allocable to and recoverable under contract with the government including fm we recovered billion in billion in and billion in ca pension cost effective february ca rule were revised to better align the recovery of pension cost including prepayment credit on government contract with the minimum funding requirement of the ppa referred to ca harmonization specifically ca harmonization shortened the amortization period for allocating gain and loss to government contract from to year and requires the use of an interest rate to determine ca pension cost consistent with the interest rate used to determine minimum pension funding requirement under the ppa while the change in the amortization period wa applicable beginning in there wa transition period for the impact of the change in the ca liability measurement due to the revised interest rate that wa phased in with the full impact occurring in the incremental impact of ca harmonization increased successively through primarily due to the liability measurement transition period included in the amended rule the enactment of the hatfa and bipartisan budget act of also increased the interest rate assumption used to determine our ca pension cost which ha the effect of lowering the recovery of pension contribution during the affected period it decrease our ca pension cost pension cost recovery under ca occur in different period from when pension contribution are made under the ppa amount contributed in excess of the ca pension cost recovered under government contract are considered to be prepayment credit under the ca rule of december our prepayment credit were approximately billion compared to billion at december the recovery of ca pension cost under government contract in excess of our contribution reduces the prepayment credit balance the prepayment credit balance will also increase or decrease based on our actual investment return on plan asset trendswe will make contribution of billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plan in including required and discretionary contribution result of these contribution we do not expect any material qualified defined benefit cash funding will be required until we plan to fund these contribution using mix of cash on hand and commercial paper while we do not anticipate need to do so our capital structure and resource would allow to issue new debt if circumstance change see our capital structure resource and other discussion above we anticipate recovering approximately billion of ca pension cost in we expect our fa pension expense to be billion comparable to our fa pension expense of billion the impact of the lower fa discount rate of for versus for wa mostly offset by our actual rate of investment return in of approximately versus our expected long term rate of return of shortened longevity assumption and cash contribution of billion versus immaterial cash contribution in we expect fa ca pension adjustment in of about billion compared to million in due to higher ca pension cost compared to environmental matterswe are party to various agreement proceeding and potential proceeding for environmental cleanup issue including matter at various site where we have been designated potentially responsible party prp at december and the total amount of liability recorded on our consolidated balance sheet for environmental matter wa million and billion we have recorded receivables totaling million and million at december and for the portion of environmental cost that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our product and service for agency of the government discussed below the amount that is expected to be allocated to our non government contract or that is determined to not be recoverable under government contract ha been expensed through cost of sale we project cost and recovery of cost over approximately year we enter into agreement administrative consent order consent decree that document the extent and timing of some of our environmental remediation obligation we also are involved in environmental remediation activity at site where formal agreement either do not exist or do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligation environmental cleanup activity usually span many year which make estimating the cost more judgmental due to for example changing remediation technology to determine the cost related to clean up site we have to ass the extent of contamination effect on natural resource the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation and evolving environmental standard of contentswe perform quarterly review of environmental remediation site and record liability and receivables in the period it becomes probable that liability ha been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated see the discussion under environmental matter in note significant accounting policy and note legal proceeding commitment and contingency included in our note to consolidated financial statement we consider the above factor in our quarterly estimate of the timing and amount of any future cost that may be required for remediation activity which result in the calculation of range of estimate for particular environmental site we do not discount the recorded liability the amount and timing of future cash payment are not fixed or can not be reliably determined given the required level of judgment and estimation it is likely that materially different amount could be recorded if different assumption were used or if circumstance were to change change in environmental standard or change in our estimate of the extent of contamination under agreement reached with the government most of the amount we spend for environmental remediation are allocated to our operation general and administrative cost under existing government regulation these and other environmental expenditure relating to our government business after deducting any recovery received from insurance or other prps are allowable in establishing price of our product and service result most of the expenditure we incur are included in our net sale and cost of sale according to government agreement or regulation regardless of the contract form cost reimbursable fixed price we continually evaluate the recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing among other factor government regulation our government business base and contract mix our history of receiving reimbursement of such cost and recent effort by some government representative to limit such reimbursement in addition to the proceeding and potential proceeding discussed above california previously established maximum level of the contaminant hexavalent chromium in drinking water of part per billion ppb recently this standard wa successfully challenged by the california manufacturer and technology association cmta for failure to conduct the required economic feasibility analysis in response to the court ruling the state water resource control board state board branch of the california environmental protection agency withdrew the hexavalent chromium standard from the published regulation leaving only the ppb standard for total chromium the state board ha indicated it will work to re establish hexavalent chromium standard if the standard for hexavalent chromium is re established at ppb or above it will not have material impact on our existing remediation cost in california further the environmental protection agency epa is considering whether to regulate hexavalent chromium california is also reevaluating it existing drinking water standard of ppb for perchlorate and the epa is taking step to regulate perchlorate in drinking water if substantially lower standard are adopted in either california or at the federal level for perchlorate or for hexavalent chromium we expect material increase in our estimate for environmental liability and the related asset for the portion of the increased cost that are probable of future recovery in the pricing of our product and service for the government the amount that would be allocable to our non government contract or that is determined not to be recoverable under government contract would be expensed which may have material effect on our earnings in any particular interim reporting period disclosed above we may record change in the amount of environmental remediation liability result of our quarterly review of the status of our environmental remediation site which would result in change to the corresponding environmental receivable and charge to earnings for example if we were to determine that the liability should be increased by million the corresponding receivables would be increased by approximately million with the remainder recorded charge to earnings this allocation is determined annually based upon our existing and projected business activity with the government we can not reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental site with which we are involved there are number of former operating facility we are monitoring or investigating for potential future remediation in some case although loss may be probable it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activity because of uncertainty assessing the extent of the contamination during any particular quarter such uncertainty may be resolved allowing to estimate and recognize the initial liability to remediate particular former operating site the amount of the liability could be material upon recognition of the liability portion will be recognized receivable with the remainder charged to earnings which may have material effect in any particular interim reporting period if we are ultimately found to have liability at those site where we have been designated prp we expect that the actual cost of remediation will be shared with other liable prps generally prps that are ultimately determined to be responsible party are strictly liable for site cleanup and usually agree among to share on an allocated basis the cost and expense for investigation and remediation under existing environmental law responsible party are jointly and severally liable and therefore we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation in the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation the statutory framework provides that we may pursue right of cost recovery or contribution from the other prps the amount we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental cost we have incurred through insurance or from other prps which we are required to pursue by agreement and government regulation of contentsgoodwillas disclosed in note significant accounting policy in our note to consolidated financial statement under the caption recent accounting pronouncement at the beginning of the quarter ended september we adopted the amendment in asu no intangible goodwill and other topic simplifying the test for goodwill impairment which eliminates the requirement to compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill commonly referred to step from the goodwill impairment test and requires entity to only compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the reporting unit carrying amount to determine goodwill impairment we elected to adopt the new standard at the beginning of the third quarter of because it significantly simplifies the evaluation of goodwill for impairment and we have updated our critical accounting policy for goodwill to reflect the adoption of the new standard the asset and liability of acquired business are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition goodwill represents cost in excess of fair value assigned to the underlying identifiable net asset of acquired business our goodwill balance wa billion at both december and we perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently whenever event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired such event or change in circumstance may include significant deterioration in overall economic condition change in the business climate of our industry decline in our market capitalization operating performance indicator competition reorganization of our business government budget restriction or the disposal of all or portion of reporting unit our goodwill ha been allocated to and is tested for impairment at level referred to the reporting unit which is our business segment level or level below the business segment the level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires to determine whether the operation below the business segment constitute self sustaining business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly review the operating result we may use both qualitative and quantitative approach when testing goodwill for impairment for selected reporting unit where we use the qualitative approach we perform qualitative evaluation of event and circumstance impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment based on that qualitative evaluation if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit exceeds it carrying amount no further evaluation is necessary otherwise we perform quantitative impairment test we perform quantitative test for most reporting unit at least every three year however for certain reporting unit we may perform quantitative impairment test every year to perform the quantitative impairment test we compare the fair value of reporting unit to it carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of reporting unit exceeds it carrying value goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill exceeds it fair value goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess we generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using combination of discounted cash flow dcf analysis and market based valuation methodology such comparable public company trading value and value observed in recent business acquisition determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment including the amount and timing of expected future cash flow long term growth rate discount rate and relevant comparable public company earnings multiple and relevant transaction multiple the cash flow employed in the dcf analysis are based on our best estimate of future sale earnings and cash flow after considering factor such general market condition government budget existing firm order expected future order contract with supplier labor agreement change in working capital long term business plan and recent operating performance the discount rate utilized in the dcf analysis are based on the respective reporting unit weighted average cost of capital which take into account the relative weight of each component of capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flow of the respective reporting unit the carrying value of each reporting unit includes the asset and liability employed in it operation goodwill and allocation of amount held at the business segment and corporate level in the fourth quarter of we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting unit utilizing the statutory tax rate in effect at the time of the test the result of that test indicated that for each of our reporting unit including sikorsky no impairment existed of december the carrying value of our sikorsky reporting unit includes goodwill of billion and exceeds it fair value by margin of approximately after adjusting for the positive impact of lower statutory tax rate due to the passage of the tax act on december we acquired sikorsky in november and recorded the asset acquired and liability assumed at fair value result the carrying value and fair value of our sikorsky reporting unit continue to be closely aligned therefore any business deterioration change in timing of order contract cancellation or termination or negative change in market factor could cause our sale earnings and cash flow to decline below current projection similarly market factor utilized in the impairment analysis including long term growth rate discount rate and relevant comparable public company earnings multiple and transaction multiple could negatively impact the fair value of our reporting unit based on our assessment of these circumstance we have determined that goodwill at our sikorsky reporting unit of contentsis at risk for impairment should there be deterioration of projected cash flow negative change in market factor or significant increase in the carrying value of the reporting unit during the fourth quarter of we realigned certain program within the rms business segment to align with change in management structure we performed goodwill impairment test prior and subsequent to the realignment and there wa no indication of goodwill impairment impairment assessment inherently involve management judgment regarding number of assumption such those described above due to the many variable inherent in the estimation of reporting unit fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill difference in assumption could have material effect on the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting unit and could result in goodwill impairment charge in future period intangible assetsintangible asset from acquired business are recognized at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition and consist of customer program trademark customer relationship technology and other intangible asset customer program include value assigned to major program of acquired business and represent the aggregate value associated with the customer relationship contract technology and trademark underlying the associated program and are amortized on straight line basis over period of expected cash flow used to measure the fair value which range from nine to year acquired intangible deemed to have indefinite life are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment testing this testing compare carrying value to fair value and when appropriate the carrying value of these asset is reduced to fair value finite lived intangible are amortized to expense over the applicable useful life ranging from three to year based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic benefit reflected by future net cash inflow we perform an impairment test of finite lived intangible whenever event or change in circumstance indicate their carrying value may be impaired should event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying value of finite lived intangible may be impaired the sum of the undiscounted future cash flow expected to result from the use of the asset group would be compared to the asset group carrying value should the asset group carrying amount exceed the sum of the undiscounted future cash flow we would determine the fair value of the asset group and record an impairment loss in net earnings the carrying value of our sikorsky business includes an indefinite lived trademark intangible asset of million of december in the fourth quarter of we performed the annual impairment test for the sikorsky indefinite lived trademark intangible asset utilizing the statutory tax rate in effect at the time of the test and the result indicated that no impairment existed at december the sikorsky trademark exceeded it carrying value by margin of approximately after adjusting for the positive impact of lower statutory tax rate due to the passage of the tax act on december additionally our sikorsky business ha finite lived customer program intangible asset with carrying value of billion of december discussed above in the goodwill section the carrying value and fair value of sikorsky intangible asset continue to be closely aligned due to the november acquisition of sikorsky therefore any business deterioration contract cancellation or termination or negative change in market factor could cause our sale to decline below current projection based on our assessment of these circumstance we have determined that our sikorsky intangible asset are at risk for impairment should there be any business deterioration contract cancellation or termination or negative change in market factor recent accounting pronouncementssee note significant accounting policy included in our note to consolidated financial statement under the caption recent accounting pronouncement item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskwe maintain active relationship with broad and diverse group of and international financial institution we believe that they provide with sufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct our business we continue to closely monitor the financial market environment and actively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the potential impact from adverse development with any single credit provider while ensuring availability of and access to sufficient credit resource our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and market price on certain equity security our financial instrument that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed rate long term debt the estimated fair value of our outstanding debt wa billion at december and the outstanding principal amount wa billion excluding unamortized discount and issuance cost of billion change in the level of interest rate would not have material impact on the fair value of our outstanding debt at december of contentswe use derivative instrument principally to reduce our exposure to market risk from change in foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate we do not enter into or hold derivative instrument for speculative trading purpose we transact business globally and are subject to risk associated with changing foreign currency exchange rate we enter into foreign currency hedge such forward and option contract that change in value foreign currency exchange rate change our most significant foreign currency exposure relate to the british pound sterling the euro the canadian dollar and the australian dollar these contract hedge forecasted foreign currency transaction in order to mitigate fluctuation in our earnings and cash flow associated with change in foreign currency exchange rate we designate foreign currency hedge cash flow hedge we also are exposed to the impact of interest rate change primarily through our borrowing activity for fixed rate borrowing we may use variable interest rate swap effectively converting fixed rate borrowing to variable rate borrowing indexed to libor in order to reduce the amount of interest paid these swap are designated fair value hedge for variable rate borrowing we may use fixed interest rate swap effectively converting variable rate borrowing to fixed rate borrowing in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate change on earnings these swap are designated cash flow hedge we also may enter into derivative instrument that are not designated hedge and do not qualify for hedge accounting which are intended to mitigate certain economic exposure the classification of gain and loss resulting from change in the fair value of derivative is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and it resulting designation adjustment to reflect change in fair value of derivative attributable to the effective portion of hedge are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustment to the hedged item or reflected net of income tax in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings change in the fair value of the derivative that are attributable to the ineffective portion of the hedge or of derivative that are not considered to be highly effective hedge if any are immediately recognized in earnings the aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swap at both december and wa billion the aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedge at december and wa billion and billion at december and the net fair value of our derivative instrument wa not material see note fair value measurement included in our note to consolidated financial statement unfavorable exchange rate movement of our foreign currency contract would not have material impact on the aggregate net fair value of such contract or our consolidated financial statement additionally we enter into foreign currency contract to hedge foreign currency exposure on underlying transaction we believe that any movement on our foreign currency contract would be offset by movement on the underlying transaction and therefore when taken together do not create material risk we evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transaction and only enter into agreement with those deemed to have acceptable credit risk at the time the agreement are executed our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across several bank we periodically monitor change to counterparty credit quality well our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties we do not hold or issue derivative financial instrument for trading or speculative purpose we maintain separate trust that includes investment to fund certain of our non qualified deferred compensation plan of december investment in the trust totaled billion and are reflected at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet in other noncurrent asset the trust hold investment in marketable equity security and fixed income security that are exposed to price change and change in interest rate portion of the liability associated with the deferred compensation plan supported by the trust is also impacted by change in the market price of our common stock and certain market index change in the value of the liability have the effect of partially offsetting the impact of change

the is business on august we increased our ownership interest in the awe management limited awe joint venture which operates the united kingdom nuclear deterrent program from to at which time we began consolidating awe consequently our operating result include of awe sale and of it operating profit prior to increasing our ownership interest we accounted for our investment in awe using the equity method of accounting under the equity method we recognized only of awe earnings or loss and no sale accordingly prior to august the date we obtained control we recorded of awe net earnings in our operating result and subsequent to august we recognized of awe sale and of it operating profit see note acquisition and divestiture for additional information about the change in ownership of awe on november we completed the acquisition of sikorsky aircraft corporation and certain affiliated company collectively sikorsky for billion net of cash acquired and aligned sikorsky under our rotary and mission system rms business segment the operating result and cash flow of sikorsky have been included on our consolidated statement of earnings and consolidated statement of cash flow since the november acquisition date additionally the asset and liability of sikorsky are included in our consolidated balance sheet of december and december see note acquisition and divestiture for additional information about the acquisition of sikorsky and related final purchase accounting during the fourth quarter of we realigned certain program among our business segment the amount discussion and presentation of our business segment for all period presented in these consolidated financial statement reflect the program realignment use of estimate we prepare our consolidated financial statement in conformity with generally accepted accounting principle gaap in doing so we are required to make estimate and assumption that affect the amount reported in the consolidated financial statement and accompanying note we base these estimate on historical experience and on various other assumption that we believe are reasonable under the circumstance the result of which form the basis for making judgment about the carrying amount of asset and liability that are not readily apparent from other source our actual result may differ materially from these estimate significant estimate inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statement include but are not limited to accounting for sale and cost recognition postretirement benefit plan environmental receivables and of contentsliabilities evaluation of goodwill and other asset for impairment income tax including deferred tax asset fair value measurement and contingency sale and earnings we record net sale and estimated profit for substantially all of our contract using the percentage of completion method for fixed price and cost reimbursable contract for product and service with the government sale are recorded on all time and material contract the work is performed based on agreed upon hourly rate and allowable cost we account for our service contract with non government customer using the service method of accounting we classify net sale product or service on our consolidated statement of earnings based on the attribute of the underlying contract percentage of completion method the percentage of completion method for product contract depends on the nature of the product provided under the contract for example for contract that require to perform significant level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract and or to deliver minimal quantity sale are recorded using the cost to cost method to measure progress toward completion under the cost to cost method of accounting we recognize sale and an estimated profit cost are incurred based on the proportion that the incurred cost bear to total estimated cost for contract that require to provide substantial number of similar item without significant level of development we record sale and an estimated profit on percentage of completion basis using unit of delivery the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract for contract to provide service to the government sale are generally recorded using the cost to cost method award and incentive fee well penalty related to contract performance are considered in estimating sale and profit rate on contract accounted for under the percentage of completion method estimate of award fee are based on past experience and anticipated performance we record incentive or penalty when there is sufficient information to ass anticipated contract performance incentive provision that increase or decrease earnings based solely on single significant event are not recognized until the event occurs accounting for contract using the percentage of completion method requires judgment relative to assessing risk estimating contract sale and cost including estimating award and incentive fee and penalty related to performance and making assumption for schedule and technical issue due to the number of year it may take to complete many of our contract and the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on those contract the estimation of total sale and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variable and accordingly is subject to change when adjustment in estimated total contract sale or estimated total cost are required any change from prior estimate are recognized in the current period for the inception to date effect of such change when estimate of total cost to be incurred on contract exceed estimate of total sale to be earned provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined many of our contract span several year and include highly complex technical requirement at the outset of contract we identify and monitor risk to the achievement of the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract and ass the effect of those risk on our estimate of total cost to complete the contract the estimate consider the technical requirement newly developed product versus mature product the schedule and associated task the number and type of milestone event and cost material labor subcontractor overhead and the estimated cost to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreement sometimes referred to offset agreement required under certain contract with international customer the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risk surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirement schedule and cost in the initial estimated total cost to complete the contract profit booking rate may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risk surrounding the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract which decrease the estimated total cost to complete the contract conversely our profit booking rate may decrease if the estimated total cost to complete the contract increase all of the estimate are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate in addition comparability of our business segment sale operating profit and operating margin may be impacted by change in profit booking rate on our contract accounted for using the percentage of completion method of accounting increase in the profit booking rate typically referred to risk retirement usually relate to revision in the estimated total cost that reflect improved condition on particular contract conversely condition on particular contract may deteriorate resulting in an increase in the estimated total cost to complete and reduction in the profit booking rate increase or decrease in profit booking rate are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception to date effect of such change segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other item favorable item may include the positive resolution of contractual matter cost recovery on restructuring charge insurance recovery and gain on sale of asset unfavorable item may include the adverse resolution of contractual matter restructuring charge except for significant severance action such those mentioned below in note restructuring charge which are excluded from segment operating result reserve for dispute asset impairment and loss on sale of certain asset segment operating profit and item such risk retirement reduction of profit booking rate or other matter are presented net of state income tax of contentschanges in estimate previously disclosed we have program to design integrate and install an air missile defense system for an international customer that ha experienced performance issue and for which we have periodically accrued reserve in we revised our estimated cost to complete the program eadge consequence of ongoing performance matter and recorded an additional charge of million million or per share after tax at our rms business segment of december cumulative loss including reserve remained at approximately million on this program we are continuing to monitor the viability of the program and the available option and could record additional charge in future period however based on the reserve already accrued and our current estimate of the cost to complete the program at this time we do not anticipate that additional charge if any would be material we have two commercial satellite program at our space business segment for which we have experienced performance issue related to the development and integration of modernized lm satellite platform these commercial program require the development of new satellite technology to enhance the lm power propulsion and electronics among other item the enhanced satellite is expected to benefit other commercial and government satellite program we have periodically revised our estimated cost to complete these developmental commercial program we have recorded cumulative loss of approximately million of december including approximately million million or per share after tax recorded during the year ended december while these loss reflect our estimated total loss on the program we will continue to incur unrecovered cost each period until we complete these program and may have to record additional loss reserve in future period which could be material to our operating result while we do not currently anticipate recording additional loss reserve the program remain developmental and further challenge in the delivery and integration of new satellite technology anomaly discovered during system testing requiring repair or rework further schedule delay and potential penalty could require that we record additional reserve we do not currently expect to be able to meet the delivery schedule under the contract and have informed the customer the customer could seek to exercise termination right under the contract in which case we would have to refund the payment we have received and pay certain penalty however we think the probability that the customer will seek to exercise any termination right is remote the delay beyond the termination date is modest and the customer have an immediate need for the satellite our consolidated net adjustment not related to volume including net profit booking rate adjustment and other matter net of state income tax increased segment operating profit by approximately billion in both and and billion in these adjustment increased net earnings by approximately million per share in million per share in and billion per share in service method under fixed price service contract we are paid predetermined fixed amount for specified scope of work and generally have full responsibility for the cost associated with the contract and the resulting profit or loss we record net sale under fixed price service contract with non government customer on straight line basis over the period of contract performance unless evidence suggests that net sale are earned or the obligation are fulfilled in different pattern for cost reimbursable contract for service to non government customer we record net sale service are performed except for award and incentive fee award and incentive fee are recorded when they are fixed or determinable generally at the date the amount is communicated to by the customer this approach result in the recognition of such fee at contractual interval typically every six month throughout the contract and is dependent on the customer process for notification of award and issuance of formal notification cost for all service contract are expensed incurred research and development and similar cost except for certain arrangement described below we account for independent research and development cost part of the general and administrative cost that are allocated among all of our contract and program in progress under government contractual arrangement and charged to cost of sale under certain arrangement in which customer share in product development cost our portion of unreimbursed cost is expensed incurred in cost of sale independent research and development cost charged to cost of sale totaled billion in million in and million in cost we incur under customer sponsored research and development program pursuant to contract are included in net sale and cost of sale stock based compensation compensation cost related to all share based payment is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award we generally recognize the compensation cost ratably over three year vesting period net of estimated forfeiture at each reporting date the number of share is adjusted to the number ultimately expected to vest income tax we calculate our provision for income tax using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax asset and liability are recognized based on the future tax consequence attributable to temporary difference that exist between the financial statement carrying amount of asset and liability and their respective tax base well from operating loss and tax credit carry forward we measure deferred tax asset and liability using enacted tax rate that will apply in the year in which we expect the temporary difference to be recovered or paid of contentswe periodically ass our tax exposure related to period that are open to examination based on the latest available information we evaluate our tax position to determine whether the position will more likely than not be sustained upon examination by the internal revenue service irs or other taxing authority if we can not reach more likely than not determination no benefit is recorded if we determine that the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained we record the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized when the tax position is settled we record interest and penalty related to income tax component of income tax expense on our consolidated statement of earnings interest and penalty were not material cash and cash equivalent cash equivalent include highly liquid instrument with original maturity of day or le receivables receivables include amount billed and currently due from customer and unbilled cost and accrued profit primarily related to sale on long term contract that have been recognized but not yet billed to customer pursuant to contract provision agency of the government and certain other customer have title to or security interest in asset related to such contract result of advance performance based payment and progress payment we reflect those advance and payment an offset to the related receivables balance for contract that we account for on percentage of completion basis using the cost to cost method to measure progress towards completion on occasion our customer may seek deferred payment term to purchase our product in connection with these transaction we may at our customer request enter into arrangement for the non recourse sale of customer receivables to unrelated third party financial institution for accounting purpose these transaction are not discounted and are treated sale of receivables we have no continuing involvement the sale proceeds from the financial institution are reflected in our operating cash flow on the statement of cash flow during we sold approximately million of customer receivables there were no gain or loss related to sale of these receivables inventory we record inventory at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value cost on long term contract and program in progress represent recoverable cost incurred for production or contract specific facility and equipment allocable operating overhead advance to supplier and in the case of contract with the government and substantially all other government research and development and general and administrative expense pursuant to contract provision agency of the government and certain other customer have title to or security interest in inventory related to such contract result of advance performance based payment and progress payment we reflect those advance and payment an offset against the related inventory balance for contract that we account for on percentage of completion basis using unit of delivery the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract we determine the cost of other product and supply inventory by the first in first out or average cost method property plant and equipment we record property plant and equipment at cost we provide for depreciation and amortization on plant and equipment generally using accelerated method during the first half of the estimated useful life of the asset and the straight line method thereafter the estimated useful life of our plant and equipment generally range from to year for building and five to year for machinery and equipment no depreciation expense is recorded on construction in progress until such asset are placed into operation depreciation expense related to plant and equipment wa million in million in and million in we review the carrying amount of long lived asset for impairment if event or change in the fact and circumstance indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable we ass impairment by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flow of the related asset grouping to it carrying amount if an asset is determined to be impaired we recognize an impairment charge in the current period for the difference between the fair value of the asset and it carrying amount capitalized software we capitalize certain cost associated with the development or purchase of internal use software the amount capitalized are included in other noncurrent asset on our consolidated balance sheet and are amortized on straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the resulting software which range from two to six year of december and capitalized software totaled million and million net of accumulated amortization of billion and billion no amortization expense is recorded until the software is ready for it intended use amortization expense related to capitalized software wa million in million in and million in goodwill the asset and liability of acquired business are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition goodwill represents cost in excess of fair value assigned to the underlying identifiable net asset of acquired business our goodwill balance wa billion at both december and we perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently whenever event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired such event or change in circumstance may include significant deterioration in overall economic condition change in the business climate of our industry decline in our market capitalization operating performance indicator of contentscompetition reorganization of our business government budget restriction or the disposal of all or portion of reporting unit our goodwill ha been allocated to and is tested for impairment at level referred to the reporting unit which is our business segment level or level below the business segment the level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires to determine whether the operation below the business segment constitute self sustaining business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly review the operating result we may use either qualitative or quantitative approach when testing reporting unit goodwill for impairment for selected reporting unit where we use the qualitative approach we perform qualitative evaluation of event and circumstance impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment based on that qualitative evaluation if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit exceeds it carrying amount no further evaluation is necessary otherwise we perform quantitative impairment test we perform quantitative test for most reporting unit at least once every three year however for certain reporting unit we may perform quantitative impairment test every year for the quantitative impairment test we compare the fair value of reporting unit to it carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of reporting unit exceeds it carrying value goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill exceeds it fair value goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess we generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using combination of discounted cash flow dcf analysis and market based valuation methodology such comparable public company trading value and value observed in recent business acquisition determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment including the amount and timing of expected future cash flow long term growth rate discount rate and relevant comparable public company earnings multiple and relevant transaction multiple the cash flow employed in the dcf analysis are based on our best estimate of future sale earnings and cash flow after considering factor such general market condition government budget existing firm order expected future order contract with supplier labor agreement change in working capital long term business plan and recent operating performance the discount rate utilized in the dcf analysis are based on the respective reporting unit weighted average cost of capital which take into account the relative weight of each component of capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flow of the respective reporting unit the carrying value of each reporting unit includes the asset and liability employed in it operation goodwill and allocation of amount held at the business segment and corporate level during the fourth quarter of and we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting unit the result of our annual impairment test of goodwill indicated that no impairment existed during the fourth quarter of we realigned certain program within the rms business segment to align with change in management structure we performed goodwill impairment test prior and subsequent to the realignment and there wa no indication of goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting unit during the fourth quarter of we realigned certain program between our business

deemed to have indefinite life are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment testing this testing compare carrying value to fair value and when appropriate the carrying value of these asset is reduced to fair value finite lived intangible are amortized to expense over the applicable useful life ranging from three to year based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic benefit reflected by future net cash inflow we perform an impairment test of finite lived intangible whenever event or change in circumstance indicate their carrying value may be impaired customer advance and amount in excess of cost incurred we receive advance performance based payment and progress payment from customer that may exceed cost incurred on certain contract including contract with agency of the government we classify such advance other than those reflected reduction of receivables or inventory discussed above current liability postretirement benefit plan many of our employee are covered by defined benefit pension plan and we provide certain health care and life insurance benefit to eligible retiree collectively postretirement benefit plan gaap requires that the of contentsamounts we record related to our postretirement benefit plan be computed based on service to date using actuarial valuation that are based in part on certain key economic assumption we make including the discount rate the expected long term rate of return on plan asset and other actuarial assumption including participant longevity also known mortality health care cost trend rate and employee turnover each appropriate based on the nature of the plan market related value of our plan asset determined using actual asset gain or loss over the prior three year period is used to calculate the amount of deferred asset gain or loss to be amortized these asset gain or loss along with those resulting from adjustment to our benefit obligation will be amortized to expense using the corridor method where gain and loss are recognized to the extent they exceed of the greater of plan asset or benefit obligation over the average future service period of employee expected to receive benefit under the plan of approximately nine year of december this amortization period is expected to extend approximately double in when our non union pension plan is frozen to use the average remaining life expectancy of the participant instead of average future service we recognize on plan by plan basis the funded status of our postretirement benefit plan under gaap either an asset recorded within other noncurrent asset or liability recorded within noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet the gaap funded status is measured the difference between the fair value of the plan asset and the benefit obligation of the plan the funded status under the employee retirement income security act of erisa amended by the pension protection act of ppa is calculated on different basis than under gaap environmental matter we record liability for environmental matter when it is probable that liability ha been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated the amount of liability recorded is based on our estimate of the cost to be incurred for remediation at particular site we do not discount the recorded liability the amount and timing of future cash payment are not fixed or can not be reliably determined our environmental liability are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet within other liability both current and noncurrent we expect to include substantial portion of environmental cost in our net sale and cost of sale in future period pursuant to government agreement or regulation at the time liability is recorded for future environmental cost we record receivable for estimated future recovery considered probable through the pricing of product and service to agency of the government regardless of the contract form cost reimbursable fixed price we continuously evaluate the recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing among other factor government regulation our government business base and contract mix our history of receiving reimbursement of such cost and recent effort by some government representative to limit such reimbursement we include the portion of those environmental cost expected to be allocated to our non government contract or that is determined to not be recoverable under government contract in our cost of sale at the time the liability is established our environmental receivables are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet within other asset both current and noncurrent we project cost and recovery of cost over approximately year investment in marketable security investment in marketable security consist of debt and equity security and are classified trading security of december and the fair value of our trading security totaled billion and billion and wa included in other noncurrent asset on our consolidated balance sheet our trading security are held in separate trust which includes investment to fund our deferred compensation plan liability net gain on trading security in and were million and million net loss on trading security in were million gain and loss on these investment are included in other unallocated net within cost of sale on our consolidated statement of earnings in order to align the classification of change in the market value of investment held for the plan with change in the value of the corresponding plan liability equity method investment investment where we have the ability to exercise significant influence but do not control are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are included in other noncurrent asset on our consolidated balance sheet significant influence typically exists if we have to ownership interest in the investee under this method of accounting our share of the net earnings or loss of the investee is included in operating profit in other income net on our consolidated statement of earnings since the activity of the investee are closely aligned with the operation of the business segment holding the investment we evaluate our equity method investment for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of such investment may be impaired if decline in the value of an equity method investment is determined to be other than temporary loss is recorded in earnings in the current period of both december and our equity method investment totaled billion which primarily are composed of our space business segment investment in united launch alliance ula see note legal proceeding commitment and contingency and our aeronautics and rms business segment investment in the advanced military maintenance repair and overhaul center ammroc venture our share of net earnings related to our equity method investees wa million in million in and million in of which approximately million million and million related to our space business segment of contentsduring the year ended december equity earnings included charge recorded in the first quarter of approximately million million or per share after tax which represented our portion of non cash asset impairment related to certain long lived asset held by our equity method investee ammroc we are continuing to monitor this investment it is possible that we may have to record our portion of additional charge should their business continue to experience performance issue which could adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation derivative financial instrument we use derivative instrument principally to reduce our exposure to market risk from change in foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate we do not enter into or hold derivative instrument for speculative trading purpose we transact business globally and are subject to risk associated with changing foreign currency exchange rate we enter into foreign currency hedge such forward and option contract that change in value foreign currency exchange rate change these contract hedge forecasted foreign currency transaction in order to mitigate fluctuation in our earnings and cash flow associated with change in foreign currency exchange rate we designate foreign currency hedge cash flow hedge we also are exposed to the impact of interest rate change primarily through our borrowing activity for fixed rate borrowing we may use variable interest rate swap effectively converting fixed rate borrowing to variable rate borrowing in order to reduce the amount of interest paid these swap are designated fair value hedge for variable rate borrowing we may use fixed interest rate swap effectively converting variable rate borrowing to fixed rate borrowing in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate change on earnings these swap are designated cash flow hedge we also may enter into derivative instrument that are not designated hedge and do not qualify for hedge accounting which are intended to mitigate certain economic exposure we record derivative at their fair value the classification of gain and loss resulting from change in the fair value of derivative is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and it resulting designation adjustment to reflect change in fair value of derivative attributable to the effective portion of hedge are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustment to the hedged item or reflected net of income tax in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings change in the fair value of the derivative that are attributable to the ineffective portion of the hedge or of derivative that are not considered to be highly effective hedge if any are immediately recognized in earnings the aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swap at both december and wa billion and the fair value wa not significant the aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedge at december and wa billion and billion and the fair value wa not significant derivative instrument did not have material impact on net earnings and comprehensive income during the year ended december and substantially all of our derivative are designated for hedge accounting see note fair value measurement for more information on the fair value measurement related to our derivative instrument recent accounting pronouncement revenue from contract with customersin may the financial accounting standard board fasb issued accounting standard update asu no revenue from contract with customer amended topic commonly referred to asc which will change the way we recognize revenue and significantly expand the disclosure requirement for revenue arrangement the new standard is effective for annual reporting period beginning after december we adopted the requirement of the new standard on january using the full retrospective transition method whereby asc will be applied to each prior year presented and the cumulative effect of applying asc will be recognized at january the beginning of the earliest year presented asc supersedes substantially all existing revenue guidance affecting under current gaap it will impact revenue and cost recognition across all of our business segment well our business process and our information technology system we commenced our evaluation of the impact of asc in late by evaluating it impact on selected contract at each of our business segment with this baseline understanding we developed project plan to evaluate thousand of contract across our business segment develop process and tool to dual report financial result under both current gaap and asc and ass the internal control structure in order to adopt asc on january we have periodically briefed our audit committee on our progress made towards adoption we currently recognize the majority of our revenue using the percentage of completion method of accounting whereby revenue is recognized we progress on the contract for contract with significant amount of development and or requiring the delivery of minimal number of unit revenue and profit are recognized using the percentage of completion cost to cost method to measure progress for example we use this method at our aeronautics business segment for the program at our missile and fire control mfc business segment for the thaad program at our rms business segment for the littoral combat ship and aegis combat system program and at our space business segment for government satellite program for contract that of contentsrequire to produce substantial number of similar item without significant level of development we currently record revenue and profit using the percentage of completion unit of delivery method the basis for measuring progress on the contract for example we use this method in aeronautics for the and program in mfc for tactical missile program hellfire jassm pac program and fire control program lantirn and sniper in rms for black hawk and seahawk helicopter program and in space for commercial satellite program for contract to provide service to the government revenue is generally recorded using the percentage of completion cost to cost method under asc revenue will be recognized the customer obtains control of the good and service promised in the contract performance obligation given the nature of our product and term and condition in our contract in particular those with the government including foreign military sale fm contract the customer obtains control we perform work under the contract therefore we expect to recognize revenue over time for substantially all of our contract using method similar to our current percentage of completion cost to cost method accordingly adoption of asc will primarily impact our contract where revenue is currently recognized using the percentage of completion unit of delivery method result we anticipate recognizing revenue for these contract earlier in the performance period we incur cost opposed to when unit are delivered we may also have more performance obligation in our contract under asc which may impact the timing of recording sale and operating profit including those where sale recognition is deferred pending the incurrence of cost during the third quarter of we completed our preliminary assessment of the cumulative effect of adopting asc on our december balance sheet using the full retrospective transition method the adoption resulted in decrease in inventory an increase in billed receivables contract asset unbilled receivables and contract liability customer advance and amount in excess of cost incurred to primarily reflect the impact of converting contract currently applying the unit of delivery method to the cost to cost method for recognizing revenue and profit we expect the net impact of these reclassification to increase both our current asset and current liability by approximately in addition we have completed our preliminary assessment of adopting asc on our and operating result and have presented selected recast unaudited financial data in the following table in million except per share data the impact of adopting asc on our and operating result may not be indicative of the adoption impact in future period or of our operating performance year ended december unaudited net sale profit earnings per common share basic continuing operation operation earnings per common share continuing operation operation earnings per common share operating profit includes an increase of million in and million in for the expected impact of adopting asu no compensation retirement benefit topic on january discussed below total net cash provided by operating activity and net cash used by investing and financing activity on our consolidated statement of cash flow were not impacted by the adoption of asc compensation retirement benefitsin march the fasb issued asu no compensation retirement benefit topic which change the income statement presentation of certain component of net periodic benefit cost related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan currently we record all component of net periodic benefit cost in operating profit part of cost of sale under asu no we will be required to record only the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost in operating profit and the non service cost component of net periodic benefit cost interest cost expected return on plan asset amortization of contentsof prior service cost or credit and net actuarial gain or loss part of non operating income we adopted the requirement of asu no on january using the retrospective transition method we expect the adoption of asu no to result in an increase to consolidated operating profit of million and million for and respectively and corresponding decrease in non operating income for each year we do not expect any impact to our business segment operating profit our consolidated net earnings or cash flow result of adopting asu no intangible goodwill and otherin january the fasb issued asu no intangible goodwill and other topic which eliminates the requirement to compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill commonly referred to step from the goodwill impairment test the new standard doe not change how goodwill impairment is identified we will continue to perform our quantitative and qualitative goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to it carrying amount but if we are required to recognize goodwill impairment charge under the new standard the amount of the charge will be calculated by subtracting the reporting unit fair value from it carrying amount under the prior standard if we were required to recognize goodwill impairment charge step required to calculate the implied value of goodwill by assigning the fair value of reporting unit to all of it asset and liability if that reporting unit had been acquired in business combination and the amount of the charge wa calculated by subtracting the reporting unit implied fair value of goodwill from it actual goodwill balance the new standard is effective for interim and annual reporting period beginning after december with early adoption permitted and should be applied prospectively from the date of adoption we elected to adopt the new standard for future goodwill impairment test at the beginning of the third quarter of because it significantly simplifies the evaluation of goodwill for impairment the impact of the new standard will depend on the outcome of future goodwill impairment test derivative and hedgingin august the fasb issued asu no derivative and hedging topic which eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness the guidance is effective for fiscal year beginning after december with early adoption permitted we do not expect significant impact to our consolidated asset and liability net earnings or cash flow result of adopting this new standard we plan to adopt the new standard january leasesin february the fasb issued asu no lease topic which requires the recognition of lease asset and lease liability on the balance sheet and disclosure of key information about leasing arrangement for both lessee and lessor the new standard is effective january for public company with early adoption permitted the new standard currently requires the application of modified retrospective approach to the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statement we are continuing to evaluate the expected impact to our consolidated financial statement and related disclosure we plan to adopt the new standard effective january note earnings per sharethe weighted average number of share outstanding used to compute earnings per common share were follows in million average common share outstanding for basic computation average dilutive effect of equity award average common share outstanding for diluted computation compute basic and diluted earnings per common share by dividing net earnings by the respective weighted average number of common share outstanding for the period presented our calculation of diluted earnings per common share also includes the dilutive effect for the assumed vesting of outstanding restricted stock unit rsus performance stock unit psus and exercise of outstanding stock option based on the treasury stock method there were no significant anti dilutive equity award for the year ended december and note acquisition and divestituresacquisition of sikorsky aircraft corporationon november we completed the acquisition of sikorsky from united technology corporation utc and certain of utc subsidiary the purchase price of the acquisition wa billion net of cash acquired result of the acquisition of contentssikorsky became wholly owned subsidiary of ours sikorsky is global company primarily engaged in the research design development manufacture and support of military and commercial helicopter sikorsky product include military helicopter such the black hawk seahawk ch and commercial helicopter such the and the acquisition enables to extend our core business into the military and commercial rotary wing market allowing to strengthen our position in the aerospace and defense industry further this acquisition will expand our presence in commercial and international market sikorsky ha been aligned under our rms business segment to fund the billion acquisition price we utilized billion of proceeds borrowed under temporary day revolving credit facility the day facility billion of cash on hand and billion from the issuance of commercial paper in the fourth quarter of we repaid all outstanding borrowing under the day facility with the proceeds from the issuance of billion of fixed interest rate long term note in public offering the november note in the fourth quarter of we also repaid the billion in commercial paper borrowing allocation of purchase price to asset acquired and liability assumedwe accounted for the acquisition of sikorsky business combination which requires to record the asset acquired and liability assumed at fair value the amount by which the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net asset acquired is recorded goodwill the following table summarizes the fair value of the asset acquired and liability assumed at the acquisition date including the refinement described in the previous paragraph in million cash and cash equivalent current plant and asset customer noncurrent income tax identifiable asset and payable customer advance and amount in excess of cost incurred salary benefit and payroll tax other current liability customer contractual obligation other noncurrent liability total liability assumed total consideration recorded in other noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet intangible asset related to customer program were recognized for each major helicopter and aftermarket program and represent the aggregate value associated with the customer relationship contract technology and tradenames underlying the associated program these intangible asset will be amortized on straight line basis over weighted average useful life of approximately year the useful life is based on period of expected cash flow used to measure the fair value of each of the intangible asset customer contractual obligation represent liability on certain development program where the expected cost exceed the expected sale under contract we measured these liability based on the price to transfer the obligation to market participant at the measurement date assuming that the liability will remain outstanding in the marketplace based on the estimated net cash outflow of the developmental program plus reasonable contracting profit margin required to transfer the contract to market participant we recorded assumed liability of million these liability will be liquidated in accordance with the underlying of contentseconomic pattern of the contractual obligation reflected by the estimated future net cash outflow incurred on the associated contract of december we recognized approximately million in sale related to customer contractual obligation of december the estimated liquidation of the customer contractual obligation is approximated follows million in million in million in million in million in and million thereafter the fair value of the asset acquired and liability assumed were determined using income market and cost valuation methodology the fair value measurement were estimated using significant input that are not observable in the market and thus represent level measurement defined in accounting standard codification asc fair value measurement the income approach wa primarily used to value the customer program and trademark intangible asset the income approach indicates value for an asset or liability based on the present value of cash flow projected to be generated over the remaining economic life of the asset or liability being measured both the amount and the duration of the cash flow are considered from market participant perspective our estimate of market participant net cash flow considered historical and projected pricing remaining developmental effort operational performance including company specific synergy aftermarket retention product life cycle material and labor pricing and other relevant customer contractual and market factor where appropriate the net cash flow are adjusted to reflect the uncertainty associated with the underlying assumption well the risk profile of the net cash flow utilized in the valuation the adjusted future cash flow are then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate projected cash flow is discounted at required rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving the cash flow and the time value of money the market approach is valuation technique that us price and other relevant information generated by market transaction involving identical or comparable asset liability or group of asset and liability valuation technique consistent with the market approach often use market multiple derived from set of comparables the cost approach which estimate value by determining the current cost of replacing an asset with another of equivalent economic utility wa used appropriate for property plant and equipment the cost to replace given asset reflects the estimated reproduction or replacement cost le an allowance for loss in value due to depreciation the purchase price allocation resulted in the recognition of billion of goodwill all of which is expected to be amortizable for tax purpose substantially all of the goodwill wa assigned to our rms business the goodwill recognized is attributable to expected revenue synergy generated by the integration of our product and technology with those of sikorsky cost synergy resulting from the consolidation or elimination of certain function and intangible asset that do not qualify for separate recognition such the assembled workforce of sikorsky determining the fair value of asset acquired and liability assumed requires the exercise of significant judgment including the amount and timing of expected future cash flow long term growth rate and discount rate the cash flow employed in the dcf analysis are based on our best estimate of future sale earnings and cash flow after considering factor such general market condition customer budget existing firm order expected future order contract with supplier labor agreement change in working capital long term business plan and recent operating performance use of different estimate and judgment could yield different result impact to financial resultssikorsky financial result have been included in our consolidated financial result only for the period from the november acquisition date through december result our consolidated financial result for the year ended december do not reflect full year of sikorsky result from the november acquisition date through december sikorsky generated net sale of approximately million and operating loss of approximately million inclusive of intangible amortization and adjustment required to account for the acquisition we incurred approximately million of non recoverable transaction cost associated with the sikorsky acquisition in that were expensed incurred these cost are included in other income net on our consolidated statement of earnings we also incurred approximately million in cost associated with issuing the billion november note used to repay all outstanding borrowing under the day facility used to finance the acquisition the financing cost were recorded reduction of debt and will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt of contentssupplemental pro forma financial information

earnings per common share earnings per common share unaudited supplemental pro forma financial data above ha been calculated after applying our accounting policy and adjusting the historical result of sikorsky with pro forma adjustment net of tax that assume the acquisition occurred on january significant pro forma adjustment include the recognition of additional amortization expense related to acquired intangible asset and additional interest expense related to the short term debt used to finance the acquisition these adjustment assume the application of fair value adjustment to intangible and the debt issuance occurred on january and are approximated follows amortization expense of million and interest expense of million in addition significant nonrecurring adjustment include the elimination of million pension curtailment loss net of tax recognized in and the elimination of million income tax charge related to historic earnings of foreign subsidiary recognized by sikorsky in the unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information also reflects an increase in interest expense net of tax of approximately million in the increase in interest expense is the result of assuming the november note were issued on january proceeds of the november note were used to repay all outstanding borrowing under the day facility used to finance portion of the purchase price of sikorsky contemplated at the date of acquisition the unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information doe not reflect the realization of any expected ongoing cost or revenue synergy relating to the integration of the two company further the pro forma data should not be considered indicative of the result that would have occurred if the acquisition related financing and associated note issuance and repayment of the day facility had been consummated on january nor are they indicative of future result consolidation of awe management limitedon august we increased our ownership interest in the awe joint venture which operates the united kingdom nuclear deterrent program from to at which time we began consolidating awe consequently our operating result include of awe sale and of it operating profit prior to increasing our ownership interest we accounted for our investment in awe using the equity method of accounting under the equity method we recognized only of awe earnings or

of million related to customer relationship million of net liability and noncontrolling interest of million the intangible asset are being amortized over period of eight year in accordance with the underlying pattern of economic benefit reflected by the future net cash flow in we recognized non cash net gain of million associated with obtaining controlling interest in awe which consisted of million pretax gain recognized in the operating result of our space business segment and million of tax related item at our corporate office the gain represents the fair value of our interest in awe le the carrying value of our previously held investment in awe and deferred tax the gain wa recorded in other income net on our consolidated statement of earnings the fair value of awe including the

estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss and only if we are unable to make such an estimate do we conclude and disclose that an estimate can not be made accordingly unless otherwise indicated below in our discussion of legal proceeding reasonably possible loss or range of loss associated with any individual legal proceeding can not be estimated legal proceedingsas result of our acquisition of sikorsky we assumed the defense of and any potential liability for two civil false claim act lawsuit pending in the district court for the eastern district of wisconsin in october the government filed complaint in intervention in the first suit which wa brought by qui tam relator mary patzer former derco aerospace derco employee in may the government filed complaint in intervention in the second suit which wa brought by qui tam of contentsrelator peter cimma former sikorsky support service inc sssi employee in november the court consolidated the case into single action for discovery and trial the government alleges that sikorsky and two of it wholly owned subsidiary derco and sssi violated the civil false claim act the anti kickback act and the truth in negotiation act in connection with contract the navy awarded to sssi in june to support the navy and fixed wing turboprop training aircraft sssi subcontracted with derco primarily to procure and manage spare part for the training aircraft the government alleges that sssi overbilled the navy on the contract the result of derco use of prohibited cost plus percentage of cost pricing to add profit and overhead cost percentage of the price of the spare part that derco procured and then sold to sssi the government alleges that derco claim to sssi sssi claim to the navy and sssi yearly certificate of final indirect cost from through were false in addition to violation of the false claim act the government alleges violation of the anti kickback act based on monthly chargeback through which sssi billed derco for the cost of certain sssi personnel allegedly in exchange for sssi permitting pricing arrangement that wa highly favorable to derco the government also claim that sssi submitted inaccurate cost or pricing data in violation of the truth in negotiation act for sole sourced follow on bridge contract the government complaint assert common law claim for breach of contract and unjust enrichment on january the corporation filed partial motion to dismiss intended to narrow the government claim the corporation also moved to dismiss cimma party under the false claim act first to file rule which permit only the first relator to recover in pending case the government currently seek damage in these lawsuit of approximately million subject to trebling plus statutory penalty we believe that we have legal and factual defense to the government claim although we continue to evaluate our liability and exposure we do not currently believe that it is probable that we will incur material loss if contrary to our expectation the government prevails in this matter and prof damage at or near million and is successful in such damage trebled the outcome could have an adverse effect on our result of operation in the period in which liability is recognized and on our cash flow for the period in which any damage are paid on april we filed declaratory judgment action against the mta asking the district court for the southern district of new york to find that the mta is in material breach of our agreement based on the mta failure to provide access to site where work must be performed and the customer furnished equipment necessary to complete the contract the mta filed an answer and counterclaim alleging that we breached the contract and subsequently terminated the contract for alleged default the primary damage sought by the mta are the cost to complete the contract and potential re procurement cost while we are unable to estimate the cost of another contractor to complete the contract and the cost of re procurement we note that our contract with the mta had total value of million of which million wa paid to and that the mta is seeking damage of approximately million we dispute the mta allegation and are defending against them additionally following an investigation our surety on performance bond related to this matter who were represented by independent counsel concluded that the mta termination of the contract wa improper finally our declaratory judgment action wa later amended to include claim for monetary damage against the mta of approximately million this matter wa taken under submission by the district court in december after five week bench trial and the filing of post trial pleading by the party we continue to await decision from the district court although this matter relates to our former is business we retained the litigation when we divested is environmental matterswe are involved in proceeding and potential proceeding relating to soil sediment surface water and groundwater contamination disposal of hazardous waste and other environmental matter at several of our current or former facility and at third party site where we have been designated potentially responsible party prp substantial portion of environmental cost will be included in our net sale and cost of sale in future period pursuant to government regulation at the time liability is recorded for future environmental cost we record receivable for estimated future recovery considered probable through the pricing of product and service to agency of the government regardless of the contract form cost reimbursable fixed price we continually evaluate the recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing among other factor government regulation our government business base and contract mix our history of receiving reimbursement of such cost and effort by some government representative to limit such reimbursement we include the portion of those environmental cost expected to be allocated to our non government contract or that is determined not to be recoverable under government contract in our cost of sale at the time the liability is established at december and the aggregate amount of liability recorded relative to environmental matter wa million and billion most of which are recorded in other noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet we have recorded receivables totaling million and million at december and most of which are recorded in other noncurrent asset on our consolidated balance sheet for the estimated future recovery of these cost we consider the recovery probable based on the factor previously mentioned we project cost and recovery of cost over approximately year of contentsenvironmental remediation activity usually span many year which make estimating liability matter of judgment because of uncertainty with respect to assessing the extent of the contamination well such factor changing remediation technology and changing regulatory environmental standard there are number of former and present operating facility that we are monitoring or investigating for potential future remediation we perform quarterly review of the status of our environmental remediation site and the related liability and receivables additionally in our quarterly review we consider these and other factor in estimating the timing and amount of any future cost that may be required for remediation activity and record liability when it is probable that loss ha occurred and the loss can be reasonably estimated the amount of liability recorded is based on our estimate of the cost to be incurred for remediation at particular site we do not discount the recorded liability the amount and timing of future cash payment are not fixed or can not be reliably determined we reasonably can not determine the extent of our financial exposure in all case although loss may be probable or reasonably possible in some case it is not possible at this time to estimate the loss or reasonably possible loss or range of loss we also pursue claim for recovery of cost incurred or contribution to site cleanup cost against other prps including the government and are conducting remediation activity under various consent decree order and agreement relating to soil groundwater sediment or surface water contamination at certain site of former or current operation under agreement related to certain site in california and new york the government reimburses an amount equal to percentage specific to each site of expenditure for certain remediation activity in the government capacity prp under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla in addition to the proceeding and potential proceeding discussed above california previously established maximum level of the contaminant hexavalent chromium in drinking water of part per billion ppb recently this standard wa successfully challenged by the california manufacturer and technology association cmta for failure to conduct the required economic feasibility analysis in response to the court ruling the state water resource control board state board branch of the california environmental protection agency withdrew the hexavalent chromium standard from the published regulation leaving only the ppb standard for total chromium the state board ha indicated it will work to re establish hexavalent chromium standard if the standard for hexavalent chromium is re established at ppb or above it will not have material impact on our existing remediation cost in california further the environmental protection agency epa is considering whether to regulate hexavalent chromium california is also reevaluating it existing drinking water standard of ppb for perchlorate and the epa is taking step to regulate perchlorate in drinking water if substantially lower standard are adopted in either california or at the federal level for perchlorate or for hexavalent chromium we expect material increase in our estimate for environmental liability and the related asset for the portion of the increased cost that are probable of future recovery in the pricing of our product and service for the government the amount that would be allocable to our non government contract or that is determined not to be recoverable under government contract would be expensed which may have material effect on our earnings in any particular interim reporting period operating leaseswe rent certain equipment
