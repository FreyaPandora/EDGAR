incentive for renewable energy projectsu federal state and local government have established various incentive to support the development of renewable energy project these incentive include accelerated tax depreciation ptcs itcs cash grant tax abatement and rps program wind and solar project qualify five year property that is eligible to be depreciated under the federal modified accelerated cost recovery system macrs pursuant to macrs wind and solar project are fully depreciated for tax purpose over five year period even though the useful life of such project is generally much longer than five year owner of utility scale wind facility are eligible to claim an income tax credit the ptc or an itc in lieu of the ptc upon initially achieving commercial operation the ptc is determined based on the amount of electricity produced by the wind facility during the first ten year of commercial operation this incentive wa created under the energy policy act of and ha been extended several time alternatively an itc equal to of the cost of wind facility may be claimed in lieu of the ptc in december the ptc and itc in lieu of ptc for wind facility wa extended for five year subject to the phase schedule in the table below in order to qualify for the ptc or itc in lieu of ptc construction of wind facility must begin before specified date the irs previously issued guidance setting forth two alternative pursuant to which taxpayer may begin construction on wind facility and providing that the taxpayer must maintain continuous program of construction or continuous effort to advance the project to completion in may the irs issued additional guidance relating to the december extension and phase down of the ptc and itc for wind facility in general this guidance modifies and extends the safe harbor for the continuous effort and continuous construction requirement to four year compared to two year under the previous guidance the safe harbor will generally be satisfied if the facility is placed in service no more than four calendar year after the calendar year in which construction of the facility began the irs also confirmed that retrofitted wind facility may qualify for ptcs or itcs pursuant to the safe harbor for the begin construction requirement long the cost basis of the new investment is at least of the facility total fair value owner of solar project are eligible to claim itc for new solar project or can elect to receive an equivalent cash payment from the department of treasury for the value of the itc convertible itc for qualifying solar project where construction began before the end of and the project are placed in service before in december the itc for new solar project wa extended subject to the following phase down schedule year construction of project begin wind solar itc _________________________ percentage of the full ptc available for wind project that begin construction during the applicable year itc is limited to for project not placed in service before january other country including canada and spain provide for incentive like feed in tariff for renewable energy project the feed in tariff promote renewable energy investment by offering long term contract to renewable energy producer typically based on the cost of generation of each technology of contentsmarkets and competitionelectricity market in the and canada are regional and diverse in character all are extensively regulated and competition in these market is shaped and constrained by regulation the nature of the product offered varies based on the specific of regulation in each region generally in addition to the natural constraint on pricing freedom presented by competition neer may also face specific constraint in the form of price cap or maximum allowed price for certain product neer ability to sell the output of it generation facility may also be constrained by available transmission capacity which can vary from time to time and can have significant impact on pricing the degree and nature of competition that neer face is different in wholesale market and in retail market during approximately of neer revenue wa derived from wholesale electricity market wholesale power generation is capital intensive commodity driven business with numerous industry participant neer primarily competes on the basis of price but belief the green attribute of neer generation asset it creditworthiness and it ability to offer and manage reliable customized risk solution to wholesale customer are competitive advantage wholesale power generation is regional business that is highly fragmented relative to many other commodity industry and diverse in term of industry structure such there is wide variation in term of the capability resource nature and identity of the company neer competes with depending on the market in wholesale market customer need are met through variety of mean including long term bilateral contract standardized bilateral product such full requirement service and customized supply and risk management service in general electricity market encompass three class of service energy capacity and ancillary service energy service relate to the physical delivery of power capacity service relate to the availability of mw capacity of power generation asset and ancillary service are other service that relate to power generation asset such load regulation and spinning and non spinning reserve the exact nature of these class of service is defined in part by regional tariff not all region have capacity service class and the specific definition of ancillary service vary from region to region rtos and isos exist throughout much of north america to coordinate generation and transmission across wide geographic area and to run market neer operates in all rto and iso jurisdiction of december neer also had operation of approximately mws that fall within reliability region that are not under the jurisdiction of an established rto or iso including mws within the western electricity coordinating council although each rto and iso may have differing objective and structure some benefit of these entity include regional planning managing transmission congestion developing larger wholesale market for energy and capacity maintaining reliability and facilitating competition among wholesale electricity provider neer ha operation that fall within the following rtos and isos of contentsneer competes in different region to different degree but in general it seek to enter into long term bilateral contract for the full output of it generation facility and of december approximately of neer generating capacity wa committed under long term contract where long term contract are not in effect neer sell the output of it facility into daily spot market in such case neer will frequently enter into shorter term bilateral contract typically of le than three year duration to hedge the price risk associated with selling into daily spot market such bilateral contract which may be hedge either for physical delivery or for financial pricing offset may only protect portion of the revenue that neer expects to derive from the associated generation facility and may not qualify for hedge accounting under gaap contract that serve the economic purpose of hedging some portion of the expected revenue of generation facility but are not recorded hedge under gaap are referred to non qualifying hedge for adjusted earnings purpose see management discussion overview adjusted earnings certain facility within the neer wind and solar generation portfolio produce recs and other environmental attribute which are typically sold along with the energy from the plant under long term contract or may be sold separately for the wind and solar generation not sold under long term contract the purchasing party is solely entitled to the reporting right and ownership of the environmental attribute the majority of neer revenue is derived from the output of it generation facility neer is also an active competitor in several region in the wholesale full requirement business and in providing structured and customized power and fuel product and service to variety of customer in the full requirement service typically the supplier agrees to meet the customer need for full range of product for every hour of the day at fixed price for predetermined period of time thereby assuming the risk of fluctuation in the customer volume requirement expanded competition in frequently changing regulatory environment present both opportunity and risk for neer opportunity exist for the selective acquisition of generation asset and for the construction and operation of efficient facility that can sell power in competitive market neer seek to reduce it market risk by diversified portfolio by fuel type and location well by contracting for the future sale of significant amount of the electricity output of it facility neer regulationthe energy market in which neer operates are subject to domestic and foreign regulation the case may be including local state and federal

natural gas although it is currently subject to stay issued by the supreme court the clean power plan is an example of such new regulation at the federal level the potential effect of greenhouse gas emission limit on nee and fpl electric generation unit are subject to significant uncertainty based on among other thing the timing of the implementation of any new requirement the required level of emission reduction the nature of any market based or tax based mechanism adopted to facilitate reduction the relative availability of greenhouse gas emission reduction offset the development of cost effective commercial scale carbon capture and storage technology and supporting regulation and liability mitigation measure and the range of available compliance alternative while nee and fpl electric generation unit emit greenhouse gas at lower rate of emission than most of the electric generation sector the result of operation of nee and fpl could be materially adversely affected to the extent that new federal or state law or regulation impose any new greenhouse gas emission limit any future limit on greenhouse gas emission could create substantial additional cost in the form of tax or emission allowance make some of nee and fpl electric generation unit uneconomical to operate in the long term require significant capital investment in carbon capture and storage technology fuel switching or the replacement of high emitting generation facility with lower emitting generation facility or affect the availability or cost of fossil fuel there can be no assurance that nee or fpl would be able to completely recover any such cost or investment which could have material adverse effect on their business financial condition result of operation and prospect extensive federal

compliance failure nee and fpl operation and business are subject to extensive federal regulation which generally imposes significant and increasing compliance cost on their operation and business additionally any actual or alleged compliance failure could result in significant cost and other potentially adverse effect of regulatory investigation proceeding settlement decision and claim including among other item potentially significant monetary penalty an example under the energy policy act of nee and fpl owner and operator of bulk power transmission system and or electric generation facility are subject to mandatory reliability standard compliance with these mandatory reliability standard may subject nee and fpl to higher operating cost and may result in increased capital expenditure if fpl or nee is found not to be in compliance with these standard it may incur substantial monetary penalty and other sanction both the cost of regulatory compliance and the cost that may be imposed result of any actual or alleged compliance failure could have material adverse effect on nee and fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect change in tax law

business financial condition result of operation and prospect can be materially adversely affected by weather condition including but not limited to the impact of severe weather weather condition directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and other fuel and affect the price of energy and energy related commodity in addition severe weather and natural disaster such hurricane flood tornado icing event and earthquake can be destructive and cause power outage and property damage reduce revenue affect the availability of fuel and water and require nee and fpl to incur additional cost for example to restore service and repair damaged facility to obtain replacement power and to access available financing source furthermore nee and fpl physical plant could be placed at greater risk of damage should change in the global climate produce unusual variation in temperature and weather pattern resulting in more intense frequent and extreme weather event abnormal level

standard update lease in february the fasb issued an accounting standard update which requires among other thing that lessee recognize lease liability and right of use asset for all lease see note lease critical accounting policy and estimatesnee significant accounting policy are described in note to the consolidated financial statement which were prepared under gaap critical accounting policy are those that nee belief are both most important to the portrayal of it financial condition and result of operation and require complex subjective judgment often result of the need to make estimate and assumption about the effect of matter that are inherently uncertain judgment and uncertainty affecting the application of those policy may result in materially different amount being reported under different condition or using different assumption nee considers the following policy to be the most critical in understanding the judgment that are involved in preparing it consolidated financial statement accounting for derivative and hedging activitiesnee us derivative instrument primarily swap option future and forward to manage the commodity price risk inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity well interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated primarily with outstanding and expected future debt issuance and borrowing in addition nee through neer us derivative to optimize the value of it power generation and gas infrastructure asset and engages in power and gas marketing and trading activity to take advantage of expected future favorable price movement nature of accounting estimatesaccounting pronouncement require the use of fair value accounting if certain condition are met which requires significant judgment to measure the fair value of asset and liability this applies not only to traditional financial derivative instrument but to any contract having the accounting characteristic of derivative result significant judgment must be used in applying derivative accounting guidance to contract in the event change in interpretation occur it is possible that contract that currently are excluded from derivative accounting rule would have to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with change in the fair value recorded in the statement of income assumption and accounting approachderivative instrument when required to be marked to market are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value fair value for some of the longer term contract where liquid market are not available are derived through internally developed model which estimate the fair value of contract by calculating the present value of the difference between the contract price and the forward price forward price represent the price at which buyer or seller could contract today to purchase or sell commodity at future date the near term forward market for electricity is generally liquid and therefore the price in the early year of the forward curve reflect observable market quote however in the later year the market is much le liquid and forward price curve must be developed using factor including the forward price for the commodity used fuel to generate electricity the expected system heat rate which measure the efficiency of power plant in converting fuel to electricity in the region where the purchase or sale take place and fundamental forecast of expected spot price based on modeled supply and demand in the region nee estimate the fair value of interest rate and foreign currency derivative using discounted cash flow valuation technique based on the net amount of estimated future cash inflow and outflow related to the derivative agreement the assumption in these model are critical since any change therein could have significant impact on the fair value of the derivative of contentsat fpl substantially all change in the fair value of energy derivative transaction are deferred regulatory asset or liability until the contract are settled and upon settlement any gain or loss are passed through the fuel clause see note in nee non rate regulated operation predominantly neer essentially all change in the derivative fair value for power purchase and sale fuel sale and trading activity are recognized on net basis in operating revenue fuel purchase used in the production of electricity are recognized in fuel purchased power and interchange expense and the equity method investees related activity is recognized in equity in earnings of equity method investees in nee consolidated statement of income in january nee discontinued hedge accounting for it cash flow and fair value hedge related to interest rate and foreign currency derivative instrument and therefore all change in the derivative fair value are recognized in interest expense in nee consolidated statement of income nee estimate the fair value of these derivative based on discounted cash flow valuation technique utilizing observable input certain derivative transaction at neer are entered into economic hedge but the transaction do not meet the requirement for hedge accounting hedge accounting treatment is not elected or hedge accounting ha been discontinued change in the fair value of those transaction are marked to market and reported in the consolidated statement of income resulting in earnings volatility these change in fair value are reflected in the non qualifying hedge category in computing adjusted earnings and could be significant to neer result because the economic offset to the position are not marked to market consequence nee net income reflects only the movement in one part of economically linked transaction for example gain loss in the non qualifying hedge category for certain energy derivative is offset by decrease increase in the fair value of related physical asset position in the portfolio or contract which are not marked to market under gaap for this reason nee management view result expressed excluding the unrealized mark to market impact of the non qualifying hedge meaningful measure of current period performance for additional information regarding derivative instrument see note overview and energy marketing and trading and market risk sensitivity accounting for pension benefitsnee sponsor qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all employee of nee and it subsidiary management belief that based on actuarial assumption and the well funded status of the pension plan nee will not be required to make any cash contribution to the qualified pension plan in the near future the qualified pension plan ha fully funded trust dedicated to providing benefit under the plan nee allocates net periodic income associated with the pension plan to it subsidiary annually using specific criterion nature of accounting estimatesfor the pension plan the benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of the december measurement date of all benefit attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered to that date the amount of benefit to be paid depends on number of future event incorporated into the pension benefit formula including an estimate of the average remaining life of employee survivor well the average year of service rendered the projected benefit obligation is measured based on assumption concerning future interest rate and future employee compensation level nee derives pension income from actuarial calculation based on the plan provision and various management assumption including discount rate rate of increase in compensation level and expected long term rate of return on plan asset assumption and accounting approachaccounting guidance requires recognition of the funded status of the pension plan in the balance sheet with change in the funded status recognized in other comprehensive income within shareholder equity in the year in which the change occur since nee is the plan sponsor and it subsidiary do not have separate right to the plan asset or direct obligation to their employee this accounting guidance is reflected at nee and not allocated to the subsidiary the portion of previously unrecognized actuarial gain and loss and prior service cost or credit that are estimated to be allocable to fpl net periodic income cost in future period and that otherwise would be recorded in aoci are classified regulatory asset and liability at nee in accordance with regulatory treatment net periodic pension income is included in expense and is calculated using number of actuarial assumption those assumption for the year ended december and include salary expected long term rate of return ___________________ in and an expected long term rate of return of is presented net of investment management fee of contentsin developing these assumption nee evaluated input including other qualitative and quantitative factor from it actuary and consultant well information available in the marketplace in addition for the expected long term rate of return on pension plan asset nee considered different model capital market return assumption and historical return for portfolio with an equity bond asset mix similar to it pension fund well it pension fund historical compounded return nee belief that is reasonable long term rate of return net of investment management fee on it pension plan asset nee will continue to evaluate all of it actuarial assumption including it expected rate of return at least annually and will adjust them appropriate nee utilizes in it determination of pension income market related valuation of plan asset this market related valuation reduces year to year volatility and recognizes investment gain or loss over five year period following the year in which they occur investment gain or loss for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of plan asset and the actual return realized on those plan asset since the market related value of plan asset recognizes gain or loss over five year period the future value of plan asset will be affected previously deferred gain or loss are recognized such gain and loss together with other difference between actual result and the estimate used in the actuarial valuation are deferred and recognized in determining pension income only to the extent they exceed of the greater of projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan asset the following table illustrates the effect on net periodic income of changing the critical actuarial assumption discussed above while holding all other assumption constant decrease in periodic income change inassumption nee fpl million expected long term rate of return discount salary nee also utilizes actuarial assumption about mortality to help estimate obligation of the pension plan nee ha adopted the latest revised mortality table and mortality improvement scale released by the society of actuary which adoption did not have material impact on the pension plan obligation see note carrying value of long lived assetsnee evaluates long lived asset for impairment when event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable nature of accounting estimatesthe amount of future net cash flow the timing of the cash flow and the determination of an appropriate interest rate all involve estimate and judgment about future event in particular the aggregate amount of cash flow determines whether an impairment exists and the timing of the cash flow is critical in determining fair value because each assessment is based on the fact and circumstance associated with each long lived asset the effect of change in assumption can not be generalized assumption and accounting approachan impairment loss is required to be recognized if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flow associated with that asset the impairment loss to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds the asset fair value in most instance the fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flow using an appropriate interest rate see management discussion neer result of operation gas infrastructure decommissioning and dismantlementnee account for aros under accounting guidance that requires liability for the fair value of an aro to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if it can be reasonably estimated with the offsetting associated asset retirement cost capitalized part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset of contentsnature of accounting estimatesthe calculation of the future cost of retiring long lived asset including nuclear decommissioning and plant dismantlement cost involves estimating the amount and timing of future expenditure and making judgment concerning whether or not such cost are considered legal obligation estimating the amount and timing of future expenditure includes among other thing making projection of when asset will be retired and ultimately decommissioned and cost will escalate with inflation in addition nee also make interest rate and rate of return projection on it investment in determining recommended funding requirement for nuclear decommissioning cost periodically nee is required to update these estimate and projection which can affect the annual expense amount recognized the liability recorded and the annual funding requirement for nuclear
