principal competitive factor in this market are performance breadth of product offering access to customer and partner and distribution channel software support conformity to industry standard apis manufacturing capability processor pricing and total system cost we believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the feature and function that customer and partner will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volume of our product at acceptable level of quality and at competitive price we expect competition to increase from both existing competitor and new market entrant with product that may be lower priced than or may provide better performance or additional feature not provided by our product in addition it is possible that new competitor or alliance among competitor could emerge and acquire significant market share significant source of competition come from company that provide or intend to provide gpus embedded socs and other accelerated and ai computing processor product some of our competitor may have greater marketing financial distribution and manufacturing resource than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological change our current competitor include supplier and licensors designing discrete and integrated gpus and other accelerated computing solution including chipsets that

addition to the other information in this annual report on form before you buy our common stock you should know that making such an investment involves risk including not limited to the risk described any one of the following risk could harm our business financial condition result of operation or reputation which could cause our stock price to decline and you may lose all or part of investment additional risk trend and uncertainty not presently known to or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business financial condition result of operation or reputation risk related to our business industry and partnersif we fail to meet the evolving need of our market or identify new product service or technology our revenue and financial result may be adversely impacted we created gpu based visual and accelerated computing platform that address four large market gaming professional visualization data center and automotive these market often experience rapid technological change change in customer requirement new product introduction and enhancement and evolving industry standard our success depends on our ability to identify emerging industry change and to develop new or enhance our existing product service and technology that meet the evolving need of these market such activity may require considerable technical financial compliance sale and marketing investment we devote significant resource to the development of technology and business offering in market where we have limited operating history such the automotive and data center market which present additional risk to our business we must also continue to develop the infrastructure needed to scale our business in these area including customer service and support we also must meet customer safety and compliance standard which are subject to change additionally we continue to make considerable investment in research and development which may not produce significant revenue for several year if at all if our investment are unsuccessful and we fail to develop new product service and technology or if we focus on technology that do not become widely adopted our business revenue financial condition and result of operation could be adversely affected we can not assure you that our strategic direction will result in innovative product and technology that provide value to our customer partner and ultimately our shareholder if we fail to anticipate the changing need of our target market and emerging technology trend or if we do not appropriately adapt that strategy market condition evolve in timely manner to exploit potential market opportunity our business will be harmed competition in our current and target market could prevent from growing our revenue our target market remain extremely competitive and we expect competition to intensify current competitor expand their product and or service offering industry standard continue to evolve customer need change and new competitor enter these market our competitor product service and technology may be le costly or may offer superior functionality or better feature than ours which may result among other thing in lower than expected selling price for our product in addition some of our competitor operate and maintain their own fabrication facility have longer operating history larger customer base more comprehensive intellectual property or ip portfolio and patent protection and greater financial sale marketing and distribution resource than we do these competitor may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunity in new market and end user customer trend quickly transition their product including semiconductor product to increasingly smaller line width geometry and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging material which could harm our business if we are unable to successfully compete in our target market respond to change in our target market or introduce new offering to meet the need of this competitive environment including in significant international market such china demand for our product service and technology could decrease which would cause our revenue to decline and cause our result of operation to suffer in addition the competitive landscape in our target market ha changed and may continue to evolve due to trend toward consolidation which could lead to fewer customer partner or supplier any of which could negatively affect our financial result system security and data protection breach well cyber attack could disrupt our operation reduce our expected revenue and increase our expense which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation security breach computer malware phishing and cyber attack have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent year these threat are constantly evolving making it increasingly difficult to successfully defend them or of contentsimplement adequate preventative measure these attack have occurred on our system in the past and are expected to occur in the future experienced computer programmer hacker and employee may penetrate our security control and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of our employee or third party these attack may create system disruption or cause shutdown these hacker may also develop and deploy virus worm and other malicious software program that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerability in our product including consumer and automotive product where we utilize over the air update to improve functionality over time for portion of our it infrastructure including business management and communication software product we rely on product and service provided by third party these provider may also experience breach and attack to their product which may impact our system data security breach may also result from non technical mean such action by an employee with access to our system to defend against security threat both to our internal system and those of our customer we must continuously engineer more secure product and enhance security and reliability feature which may result in increased expense actual or perceived breach of our security measure or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about our partner our customer or third party could expose and the party affected to risk of loss or misuse of this information resulting in litigation and potential liability paying damage regulatory inquiry or action damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business our effort to prevent and overcome these challenge could increase our expense and may not be successful we may experience interruption delay cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customer such disruption could adversely impact our ability to fulfill order and interrupt other critical function delayed sale lower margin or lost customer result of these disruption could adversely affect our financial result stock price and reputation we depend on third party and their technology to manufacture assemble test and or package our product which reduces our control over product quantity and quality manufacturing yield development enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business we do not manufacture the silicon wafer used for our gpus and tegra processor and do not own or operate wafer fabrication facility instead we are dependent on industry leading foundry such taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited and samsung electronics co ltd to manufacture our semiconductor wafer using their fabrication equipment and technique similarly we do not directly assemble test or package our product but instead rely on independent subcontractor we do not have long term commitment contract with these foundry or subcontractor result we face several significant risk which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand and or negatively impact our business operation gross margin revenue and or financial result including lack of guaranteed supply of wafer and other component and potential higher wafer and component price due to supply constraint failure by our foundry to procure raw material or to provide or allocate adequate or any manufacturing or test capacity for our product failure to develop obtain or successfully implement high quality leading edge process technology including transition to smaller geometry process technology such advanced process node technology and memory design needed to manufacture our product profitably or on timely basis limited number of supplier including foundry assembly and test provider and memory manufacturer loss of supplier and additional expense and or production delay result of qualifying new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of loss of or decision to add or change supplier lack of direct control over delivery schedule or product quantity and quality and delay in product shipment shortage decrease in product quality and or higher expense in the event our subcontractor or foundry prioritize our competitor order over our order or otherwise in addition low manufacturing yield could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand increase manufacturing cost harm customer or partner relationship and or negatively impact our business operation gross margin revenue and or financial result manufacturing yield for our product are function of product design which is developed largely by and process technology which typically is proprietary to the foundry low yield may result from either product design or process technology failure we do not know whether yield problem will exist our design is actually manufactured by the foundry result yield problem may not be identified until well into the manufacturing process and require and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem we also rely on third party software development tool to assist in the design simulation and verification of new product or product enhancement and to bring such new product and enhancement to market in timely manner in the past we have experienced delay in the introduction of product and enhancement result of the inability of then available of contentssoftware development tool to fully simulate the complex feature and functionality of our product the design requirement necessary to meet consumer demand for more feature and greater functionality from our product may exceed the capability of available software development tool if we miss design cycle or lose design win due to the unavailability of such software development tool we could lose market share and our revenue could decline if we fail to achieve design win for our product our business will be harmed for our product that we do not sell directly to consumer achieving design win is an important success factor achieving design win may involve lengthy process in pursuit of customer opportunity and depend on our ability to anticipate feature and functionality that customer and consumer will demand failure to obtain particular design win may prevent from obtaining design win in subsequent generation of particular product this could result in lost revenue and could weaken our position in future competitive bid selection process unanticipated change in industry standard could render our product incompatible with product developed by major hardware manufacturer and software developer further if our product are not in compliance with prevailing industry standard including safety standard our customer may not incorporate our product into their design strategy winning product design doe not guarantee sale to customer or that we will realize much revenue anticipated if any if our product contain significant defect we could incur significant expense to remediate such defect our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market share our product are complex and may contain defect or security vulnerability or experience failure or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issue in design fabrication packaging material and or use within system these risk may increase our product are introduced into new device market technology and application including into the automotive market or new version are released some error in our product or service may only be discovered after product or service ha been shipped or used by customer or the end user of such product undiscovered vulnerability in our product or service could expose our customer or end user to hacker or other unscrupulous third party who develop and deploy virus worm and other malicious software program that could attack our product or service failure of our product to perform to specification or other product defect could lead to substantial damage to the product we sell directly to customer the end product in which our device ha been integrated by oems odms aibs and tier automotive supplier and to the user of such end product any such defect may cause to incur significant warranty support and repair or replacement cost write the value of related inventory cause to lose market share and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development effort to find and correct the issue in addition an error or defect in new product or release or related software driver after commencement of commercial shipment could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design win harm our relationship with customer and partner and harm consumer perception of our brand also we may be required to reimburse our customer partner or consumer including cost to repair or replace product in the field product recall including automotive recall or recall due to bug in our product or significant number of product return could be expensive damage our reputation harm our ability to attract new customer result in the shifting of business to our competitor and result in litigation against such product liability suit if product liability claim is brought against the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the effort of our technical and management personnel and harm our business further our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable term which could adversely impact our financial result business disruption could harm our business lead to decline in revenue and increase our cost our worldwide operation could be disrupted by earthquake telecommunication failure power or water shortage outage at cloud service provider tsunami flood hurricane typhoon fire extreme weather condition cyber attack terrorist attack medical epidemic or pandemic and other natural or man made disaster catastrophic event or climate change the occurrence of any of these disruption could harm our business and result in significant loss decline in revenue and an increase in our cost and expense any of these business disruption could require substantial expenditure and recovery time in order to fully resume operation our corporate headquarters and portion of our research and development activity are located in california and other critical business operation finished good inventory and some of our supplier are located in asia near major earthquake fault known for seismic activity in addition large portion of our current data center capacity is located in california making our operation vulnerable to natural disaster or other business disruption occurring in these geographical area the manufacture of product component the final assembly of our product and other critical operation are concentrated in certain geographic location including taiwan china hong kong and korea additionally significant portion of our finished good product distribution occurs through hong kong geopolitical change or change in government regulation and policy in the united state or abroad may result in changing regulatory requirement trade policy import duty and economic disruption that could impact our operating strategy product demand access to global market hiring and profitability in particular revision to law or regulation or their of contentsinterpretation and enforcement could result in increased taxation trade sanction the imposition of import duty or tariff restriction and control on import or export or other retaliatory action which could have an adverse effect on our business plan for example regulation to implement the export control reform act of could have an adverse effect on our business plan catastrophic event can also have an impact on third party vendor who provide critical infrastructure service for it and research and development system and personnel our operation could be harmed if manufacturing logistics or other operation in these location are disrupted for any reason including natural disaster high heat event or water shortage information technology system failure military action or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issue the ultimate impact on our third party foundry and other supplier and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake fault and being consolidated in certain geographical area is unknown in the event major earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event affect or the third party system on which we rely our business could be harmed result of decline in revenue increase in expense substantial expenditure and time spent to fully resume operation in january novel strain of coronavirus wa identified in china resulting in shutdown of manufacturing and commerce well global travel restriction to contain the virus the impact ha extended to other region we have operation and employee in china and the region represents an important end market for our product our customer and supplier within china and neighboring country are also affected by the coronavirus related restriction and closure the coronavirus is expected to have negative effect on our financial result though the full extent and duration is uncertain and could have material negative impact on our business if we fail to estimate customer demand properly our financial result could be harmed we manufacture our gpus and tegra processor based on estimate of customer demand and requirement we sell many of our product through channel model and our channel customer sell to retailer distributor and or end customer result the decision made by our channel partner retailer and distributor in response to changing market condition and the changing demand for our product could impact our financial result in order to have shorter shipment lead time and quicker delivery schedule for our customer we may build inventory for anticipated period of growth which do not occur may build inventory anticipating demand that doe not materialize or may build inventory to serve what we believe is pent up demand such decision may and have resulted in prolonged channel sell through we experienced with our mid range gaming gpus in fiscal year in estimating demand we make multiple assumption any of which may prove to be incorrect situation that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include change in business and economic condition including downturn in our target market and or overall economy change in consumer confidence caused by change in market condition including change in the credit market sudden and significant decrease in demand for our product higher incidence of inventory obsolescence of rapidly changing technology or customer requirement our introduction of new product resulting in lower demand for older product le demand than expected for newly introduced product or increased competition including competitive pricing action the cancellation or deferral of customer purchase order could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our gross margin in addition because we often sell substantial portion of our product in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitment in timely manner in response to customer cancellation or deferral we could be required to write our inventory to the lower of cost or market or write off excess inventory and we could experience reduction in average selling price if we incorrectly forecast product demand any of which could harm our financial result conversely if we underestimate our customer demand for our product our foundry partner may not have adequate lead time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customer order on timely basis we may also face supply constraint caused by natural disaster or other event in such case even if we are able to increase production level to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in cost effective or timely manner if we fail to fulfill our customer order on timely basis or at all our customer relationship could be damaged we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged we receive significant amount of our revenue from limited number of customer within our partner network and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customer we receive significant amount of our revenue from limited number of customer within our distribution and partner network with several of these distributor and partner we are selling multiple target market platform through their channel for fiscal year of our total revenue wa from one customer dell our operating result in the foreseeable of contentsfuture will continue to depend on sale within our partner network well the ability of these partner to sell product that incorporate our gpus and tegra processor in the future these partner may decide to purchase fewer product than they in the past not to incorporate our product into their ecosystem or to alter their purchasing pattern in some other way particularly because most of our sale are made on purchase order basis which permit our customer to cancel change or delay product purchase commitment with little or no notice to and without penalty our partner may develop their own solution our customer may purchase product from our competitor or our partner may discontinue sale or lose market share in the market for which they purchase our product we could also be restricted from selling our product or providing our technology and service due to trade restriction the loss of any of our large customer significant reduction in purchase by them or our inability to sell to customer due to trade restriction would likely harm our financial condition and result of operation and any difficulty in collecting account receivable could harm our operating result and financial condition we maintain an allowance for doubtful account for estimated loss resulting from the inability of certain of our customer to make required payment and obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customer in the future we may have to record additional provision or write offs and or defer revenue on certain sale transaction which could negatively impact our financial result and we may not be able to acquire credit insurance on the credit we extend to these customer or in amount that we deem sufficient we are subject to risk and uncertainty associated with international operation which may harm our business we conduct our business worldwide and we have office in various country outside of the united state our semiconductor wafer are manufactured assembled tested and packaged by third party located outside of the united state we also generate significant portion of our revenue from sale outside the united state we allocate revenue to individual country based on the location to which the product are initially billed even if our customer revenue is attributable to end customer that are located in different location revenue from sale outside of the united state accounted for of total revenue for fiscal year and for each of fiscal year and revenue from billing to china including hong kong wa of our revenue for fiscal year even if our customer revenue is attributable to end customer that are located in different location additionally of january approximately of our employee were located outside of the united state the global nature of our business subject to number of risk and uncertainty which could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation including international economic and political condition including result of the united kingdom vote to withdraw from the european union and other political tension country in which we do business unexpected change in or imposition of legislative or regulatory requirement including change in tax law differing legal standard with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practice local business and cultural factor that differ from our normal standard and practice including business practice that we are prohibited from engaging in by the foreign corrupt practice act and other anticorruption law and regulation exporting or importing issue related to export or import restriction including deemed export restriction tariff quota and other trade barrier and restriction disruption of capital and trading market and currency fluctuation and increased cost due to imposition of climate change regulation such carbon tax fuel or energy tax and pollution limit if our sale outside of the united state are delayed or cancelled because of any of the factor our revenue may be negatively impacted if we are unable to attract retain and motivate our executive and key employee we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively to be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully we must attract retain and motivate our executive and key employee the market for highly skilled worker and leader in our industry is extremely competitive in particular hiring qualified executive scientist engineer technical staff and research and development personnel is critical to our business additionally change in immigration and work permit law and regulation or the administration or interpretation of such law or regulation could impair our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employee if we are le successful of contentsin our recruiting effort or if we can not retain key employee our ability to develop and deliver successful product and service may be adversely affected additionally competition for personnel result in increased cost in the form of cash and stock based compensation the interpretation and application of employment related law to our workforce practice may result in increased operating cost and le flexibility in how we meet our workforce need effective succession planning is also important to our long term success failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transition involving key employee could hinder our strategic planning and execution we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefit of business acquisition or strategic investment including the mellanox acquisition and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition target which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new product or sell our product we have in the past acquired and invested in and may continue to acquire and invest in other business that offer product service and technology that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing product strategic objective and business in march we announced our agreement to acquire mellanox for approximately billion the mellanox acquisition and other past or future acquisition or investment involve significant challenge and risk and could impair our ability to grow our business develop new product or sell our product and ultimately could have negative impact on our growth or our financial result given that our resource are limited our decision to pursue transaction ha opportunity cost accordingly if we pursue particular transaction we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transaction that could help achieve our strategic objective additional risk related to the mellanox acquisition and other acquisition or strategic investment include but are not limited to difficulty in combining the technology product operation or workforce of the acquired business with our business diversion of capital and other resource including management attention assumption of liability and incurring amortization expense impairment charge to goodwill or write down of acquired asset integrating financial forecasting and control procedure and reporting cycle coordinating and integrating operation in country in which we have not previously operated difficulty in realizing satisfactory return if at all difficulty in obtaining regulatory other approval or financing failure and cost associated with the failure to consummate proposed acquisition or other strategic investment legal proceeding initiated result of an acquisition or investment uncertainty and time needed to realize the benefit of an acquisition or strategic investment if at all negative change in general economic condition in the region or the industry in which we or our target operate the need to later divest acquired asset if an acquisition doe not meet our expectation potential failure of our due diligence process to identify significant issue with the acquired asset or company and impairment of relationship with or loss of our or our target employee vendor and customer result of our acquisition or investment risk related to regulatory legal our common stock and other mattersactions to adequately protect our ip right could result in substantial cost to and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful in so or if we are prohibited from making or selling our product we have in the past currently are and may in the future become involved in lawsuit or other legal proceeding alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property right violation by our employee or party that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claim of infringement an unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damage invalidation of patent or family of patent indemnification of customer payment of lost profit or when it ha been sought injunctive relief claim that our product or process infringe the ip right of others regardless of their merit could cause to incur significant cost to respond to defend and resolve such claim and they may also divert the effort and attention of management and technical personnel we may commence litigation or other legal proceeding in order to protect our intellectual property right such proceeding may increase our operating expense which could negatively impact our operating result further we could be subject to countersuit result of our initiation of litigation if infringement claim are made against or our product are found to infringe third party patent or intellectual property we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek license to the third party patent or other intellectual property right however we may not be able to obtain license at all or on term acceptable to particularly from our competitor if we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain license from of contentsa third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our product we could be subject to substantial liability or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our product we may also have to make royalty or other payment or cross license our technology if these arrangement are not concluded on commercially reasonable term our business could be negatively impacted furthermore the indemnification of customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expense which could negatively impact our operating result our success depends in part on protecting our intellectual property to accomplish this we rely primarily on combination of patent trademark trade secret employee and third party nondisclosure agreement licensing arrangement and the law of the country in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the united state and internationally we may be required to spend significant resource to monitor and protect our intellectual property right and even with significant expenditure we may not be able to protect our intellectual property right that are valuable to our business the law of certain foreign country may not protect our product or intellectual property right to the same extent the law of the united state this make the possibility of piracy of our technology and product more likely in addition the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secret and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our product result the value of our investment in research and development product development and marketing could be reduced we continuously ass whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovation and technology but can not be certain whether our application for such protection will be approved and if approved whether we will be able to enforce such protection our operating result have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate and if our operating result are below the expectation of security analyst or investor our stock price could decline our operating result have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factor therefore investor should not rely on quarterly comparison of our result of operation an indication of our future performance factor other than those described elsewhere in these risk factor that could affect our result of operation in the future include but are not limited to our ability to achieve volume production of our next generation product our inability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfall due to the multi year development cycle for some of our product and service fluctuation in the demand for our product related to cryptocurrencies change in the timing of product order due to unexpected delay in the introduction of our partner product our ability to cover the manufacturing and design cost of our product through competitive pricing our ability to comply and continue to comply with our customer contractual obligation product rate of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issue our ability to secure appropriate safety certification and meet industry safety standard supply constraint for and change in the cost of the other component incorporated into our product inventory write down our ability to continue generating revenue from our partner network including by generating sale within our partner network and ensuring our product are incorporated into our partner product ecosystem and our partner network ability to sell product that incorporate our gpus and tegra processor the inability of certain of our customer to make required payment to and our ability to obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customer customer bad debt write offs any unanticipated cost associated with environmental liability unexpected cost related to our ownership of real property change in financial accounting standard or interpretation of existing standard and general macroeconomic or industry event and factor affecting the overall market and our target market any one or more of the factor discussed above could prevent from achieving our expected future financial result any such failure to meet our expectation or the expectation of our investor or security analyst could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility of contentsprivacy concern relating to our product and service could damage our reputation deter current and potential user from using our product and service result in liability or result in legal or regulatory proceeding our product and service may provide with access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security law and regulation concern about our practice with regard to the collection use retention security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy related matter even if unfounded could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating result the theft loss or misuse of personal data collected used stored or transferred by to run our business or by one of our partner could result in significantly increased security cost damage to our reputation regulatory proceeding disruption of our business activity or increased cost related to defending legal claim worldwide regulatory authority are considering and have approved various legislative proposal concerning data protection which continue to evolve and apply to our business for example the european union adopted the general data protection regulation or gdpr which requires company to meet new requirement effective of may regarding the handling of personal data including it use protection and the ability of person whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about failure to meet gdpr requirement could result in penalty of up to of worldwide revenue in addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection law in the united state europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and fluid and may be interpreted and applied in manner that is inconsistent with our data practice if so we may be ordered to change our data practice and or be fined complying with these changing law ha caused and could continue to cause to incur substantial cost which could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation further failure to comply with existing or new rule may result in significant penalty or order to stop the alleged noncompliant activity we may have exposure to additional tax liability and our operating result may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rate multinational corporation we are subject to income tax well non income based tax such payroll sale use value added net worth property and good and service tax in both the united state and various foreign jurisdiction our domestic and international tax liability are subject to the

excess quantity of product or component based on our inventory level and future product purchase commitment compared to assumption about future demand and market condition situation that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include change in business and economic condition change in market condition sudden and significant decrease in demand for our product inventory obsolescence because of

reclassificationscertain prior fiscal year balance have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation principle of consolidationour consolidated financial statement include the account of nvidia corporation and our wholly owned subsidiary all intercompany balance and transaction have been eliminated in consolidation use of estimatesthe preparation of financial statement in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset and liability and disclosure of contingent asset and liability at the date of the financial statement and the reported amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period actual result could differ materially from our estimate on an on going basis we evaluate our estimate including those related to revenue recognition cash equivalent and marketable security account receivable inventory income tax goodwill stock based compensation litigation investigation and settlement cost restructuring and other charge and other contingency these estimate are based on historical fact and various other assumption that we believe are reasonable revenue recognitionwe derive our revenue from product sale including hardware and system license and development arrangement and software licensing we determine revenue recognition through the following step identification of the contract with customer identification of the performance obligation in the contract determination of the transaction price allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligation in the contract and recognition of revenue when or we satisfy performance obligation product sale revenuerevenue from product sale is recognized upon transfer of control of promised product to customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those product revenue is recognized net of allowance for return customer program and any tax collected from customer for product sold with right of return we record reduction to revenue by establishing sale return allowance for estimated product return at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rate however if product return for fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rate we may determine that additional sale return allowance are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product return our customer program involve rebate which are designed to serve sale incentive to resellers of our product in various target market and marketing development fund or mdfs which represent monies paid to our partner that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partner activity while also promoting nvidia product we account for customer program reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebate and mdfs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customer of contentsnvidia corporation and subsidiariesnotes to the consolidated financial statement continued license and development arrangementsour license and development arrangement with customer typically require significant customization of our intellectual property component result we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development service single performance obligation over the period in which the development service are performed we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project if loss on an arrangement becomes probable during period we record provision for such loss in that period software licensingour software license provide our customer with right to use the software when it is made available to the customer customer may purchase either perpetual license or subscription to license which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefit from the software software license are frequently sold along with post contract customer support or pc for such arrangement we allocate revenue to the software license and pc on relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable input to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation revenue from software license is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer pc revenue is recognized ratably over the service period or service are performed advertising expenseswe expense advertising cost in the period in which they are incurred advertising expense for fiscal year and were million million and million respectively product warrantieswe generally offer limited warranty to end user that range from one to three year for product in order to repair or replace product for any manufacturing defect or hardware component failure cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranty that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition under limited circumstance we may offer an extended limited warranty to customer for certain product we also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issue if loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated stock based compensationwe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant minus dividend yield discount the fair value of award of restricted stock unit or rsus and performance stock unit that are based on our corporate financial performance target or psus we use monte carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock unit that are based on market condition or market based psus the compensation expense for rsus and market based psus is recognized using straight line attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for psus is recognized using an accelerated amortization model we estimate the fair value of share to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan or espp using the black scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in march and september of each year stock based compensation for our espp is expensed using an accelerated amortization model additionally we estimate forfeiture annually based on historical experience and revise the estimate of forfeiture in subsequent period if actual forfeiture differ from those estimate litigation investigation and settlement costsfrom time to time we are involved in legal action and or investigation by regulatory body there are many uncertainty associated with any litigation or investigation and we can not be certain that these action or other third party claim against will be resolved without litigation fine and or substantial settlement payment if information becomes available that cause to determine that loss in any of our pending litigation investigation or settlement is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such event we will record the loss in accordance with gaap however the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimate which could require to record additional cost foreign currency remeasurementwe use the united state dollar our functional currency for all of our subsidiary foreign currency monetary asset and liability are remeasured into united state dollar at end of period exchange rate non monetary asset and liability such property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rate revenue and expense are remeasured at average exchange rate in effect during each period

subsidiariesnotes to the consolidated financial statement continued remeasurement are included in other income or expense in our consolidated statement of income and to date have not been significant income taxeswe recognize federal state and foreign current tax liability or asset based on our estimate of tax payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax asset or liability appropriate for our estimate of future tax effect attributable to temporary difference and carryforwards and we record valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax asset by the amount of any tax benefit that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized our calculation of deferred tax asset and liability is based on certain estimate and judgment and involves dealing with uncertainty in the application of complex tax law our estimate of deferred tax asset and liability may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome change in accounting standard or tax law in the united state or foreign jurisdiction where we operate or change in other fact or circumstance in addition we recognize liability for potential united state and foreign income tax contingency based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax may be due if we determine that payment of these amount is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is le than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statement accordingly of january we had valuation allowance of million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax asset that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projection of future taxable income and potential utilization limitation of tax attribute acquired result of stock ownership change to the extent realization of the deferred tax asset becomes more likely than not we would recognize such deferred tax asset an income tax benefit during the period we recognize the benefit from tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merit of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalty related to unrecognized tax benefit component of income tax expense net income per sharebasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common share outstanding during the period diluted net income per share is computed using the

than temporary or have other indicator of impairment if the fair value of an available for sale debt instrument is le than it amortized cost basis an other than temporary impairment is triggered in circumstance where we intend to sell the instrument it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of it amortized cost basis or credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument in these situation we recognize an of contentsnvidia corporation and subsidiariesnotes to the consolidated financial statement continued other than temporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instrument amortized cost basis and it fair value for available for sale debt instrument
