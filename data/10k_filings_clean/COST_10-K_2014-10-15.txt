relocation and the closure in september of the acapulco mexico location due to storm damage of contentsitem management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation amount in million except per share share membership fee and warehouse count data overviewwe believe that the most important driver of increasing our profitability is sale growth particularly comparable sale growth we define comparable warehouse sale sale from warehouse open for more than one year including remodels relocation and expansion well online sale related to website operating for more than one year comparable sale growth is achieved through increasing the shopping frequency from new and existing member and the amount they spend on each visit sale comparison can also be particularly influenced by two factor that are beyond our control including fluctuation in currency exchange rate with respect to the consolidation of the result of our international operation and change in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive condition primarily impacting domestic operation the higher our comparable sale exclusive of these item the more we can leverage certain of our selling general and administrative expense reducing them percentage of sale and enhancing profitability generating comparable sale growth is foremost question of making available to our member the right merchandise at the right price skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term another substantial factor in sale growth is the health of the economy in which we do business especially the united state sale growth and gross margin are also impacted by our competition which is vigorous and widespread including wide range of global national and regional wholesaler and retailer including supermarket supercenters department and specialty store gasoline station and internet based retailer while we can not control or reliably predict general economic health or change in competition we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these change such through adjustment to our pricing and to our merchandise mix including increasing the penetration of our private label item our philosophy is to provide our member with quality good and service at the most competitive price we do not focus in the short term on maximizing price that our member can be charged but instead seek to maintain we believe is perception among our member of our pricing authority consistently providing the most competitive value our investment in merchandise pricing can from time to time include reducing price on merchandise to drive sale or meet competition and holding price steady despite cost increase instead of passing the increase on to our member all negatively impacting near term gross margin percentage of sale we believe our gasoline business draw member to our warehouse but it ha lower gross margin percentage of net sale relative to our non gasoline business higher penetration of gasoline sale will generally lower our gross margin percentage of net sale we also achieve sale growth by opening new warehouse our warehouse base grows however available and desirable potential site become more difficult and potentially more expensive to secure and square footage growth may become comparatively le substantial component of sale growth the negative aspect of such growth including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouse and cannibalization of sale at existing warehouse when opening occur in existing market are increasingly le significant relative to the result of our total operation our rate of square footage growth is higher in foreign market due to the smaller base in those market and we expect that to continue our membership format is an integral part of our business model and ha significant effect on our profitability this format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue the extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base increase the penetration of our executive member and sustain high renewal rate materially influence our profitability our financial performance also depends heavily on our ability to control cost while we believe that we have achieved success in this area historically some significant cost are partially outside our control most particularly health care and utility expense with respect to expense relating to the compensation of our employee our philosophy is not to seek to minimize the wage and benefit that they earn rather we believe that achieving our longer term objective of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation level that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce this may cause for example to absorb cost that other employer might seek to pas through to their workforce because our business is operated on very low margin modest change in various item in the income statement particularly gross margin and selling general and administrative expense can have substantial impact on net income our operating model is generally the across our canada and other international operating segment see note to the consolidated financial statement included in item of this report certain country in the other international
