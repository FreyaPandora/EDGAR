of business confidence lower corporate earnings high real interest rate lower credit activity or tighter credit condition perceived or actual industry overcapacity higher unemployment and lower consumer spending prolonged period of economic weakness may also result in increased expense due to higher allowance for doubtful account and potential goodwill and asset impairment charge economic

impact on our business result of operation and financial condition we operate in highly competitive environment which could adversely affect our sale and pricing we operate in highly competitive environment we compete on the basis of variety of factor including product performance customer service quality and price there can be no assurance that our product will be able to compete

difficulty our failure to price our product competitively our failure to produce our product at competitive cost or an unexpected buildup in competitor new machine or dealer owned rental fleet which could lead to downward pressure on machine rental rate and or used equipment price lack of customer acceptance of price increase we announce from time to time change in customer requirement for price discount change in our customer behavior or weak pricing environment could have an adverse impact on our business result of operation and financial condition in addition our result and ability to

information corruption of data diminution in the value of our investment in research development and engineering and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation cost which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness result of operation and financial condition due to the evolving nature of such security threat the potential impact of any future incident can not be predicted further the amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover claim or liability relating to cybersecurity attack in addition data we collect store and process is subject to variety of and international law and regulation such the european union general data protection regulation that became effective in may which may carry significant potential penalty for noncompliance our business is subject to the inventory management decision and sourcing practice of our dealer and our oem customer we sell finished product primarily through an independent dealer network and directly to oems and are subject to risk relating to their inventory management decision and operational and sourcing practice both carry inventory of finished product part of ongoing operation and adjust those inventory based on their assessment of future need and market condition including level of used equipment inventory and machine rental usage rate such adjustment may impact our result positively or negatively if the inventory level of our dealer and oem customer are higher than they desire they may postpone product purchase from which could cause our sale to be lower than the end user demand for our product and negatively impact our result similarly our result could be negatively impacted through the loss of time sensitive sale if our dealer and oem customer do not maintain inventory level sufficient to meet customer demand we may not realize all of the anticipated benefit of our acquisition joint venture or divestiture or these benefit may take longer to realize than expected in pursuing our business strategy we routinely evaluate target and enter into agreement regarding possible acquisition divestiture and joint venture we often compete with others for the opportunity to be successful we conduct due diligence to identify valuation issue and potential loss contingency negotiate transaction term complete complex transaction and manage post closing matter such the

reduction may not occur expected unforeseen expense delay or condition may be imposed upon the acquisition including due to required regulatory approval or consent we may acquire or assume unexpected liability or be subject to unexpected penalty or other enforcement action faulty assumption may be made regarding the macroeconomic environment or the integration process unforeseen difficulty may arise in integrating operation process and system higher than expected investment may be required to implement necessary compliance process and related system including information technology system accounting system and internal control over financial reporting we may fail to retain motivate and integrate key management and other employee of the acquired business higher than expected cost may arise due to unforeseen change in tax trade environmental labor safety payroll or pension policy in any jurisdiction in which the acquired business conduct it operation of content we may experience problem in retaining customer and integrating customer base many of these factor will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased cost decrease in the amount of expected revenue and diversion of management time and attention they may also delay the realization of the benefit we anticipate when we enter into transaction in order to conserve cash for operation we may undertake acquisition financed in part through public offering or private placement of debt or equity security or other arrangement such acquisition financing could result in decrease in our earnings and adversely affect other leverage measure if we issue equity security or equity linked security the issued security may have dilutive effect on the interest of the holder of our common share failure to implement our acquisition strategy including successfully integrating acquired business could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation furthermore we make strategic divestiture from time to time in the case of divestiture we may agree to indemnify acquiring party for certain liability arising from our former business these divestiture may also result in

product generally depends on customer ability to pay for our product which in turn depends on their access to fund change in global economic condition may result in customer experiencing increased difficulty in generating fund from operation capital and credit market volatility and uncertainty may cause financial institution to revise their lending standard resulting in customer decreased access to capital if capital and credit market volatility occurs customer liquidity may decline which in turn would reduce their ability to purchase our product failure to maintain our credit rating would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our cost of fund liquidity competitive position and access to capital market each of caterpillar and cat financial cost of borrowing and their respective ability to access the capital market are affected not only by market condition but also by the short and long term credit rating assigned to their respective debt by the major credit

guarantee and product warranty of part ii item financial statement and supplementary data recent accounting pronouncementsfor discussion of recent accounting pronouncement see note new accounting guidance of part ii item financial statement and supplementary data critical accounting policy the preparation of financial statement in conformity with generally accepted accounting principle requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect reported amount the more significant estimate include residual value for leased asset fair value for goodwill impairment test warranty liability reserve for product liability and insurance loss postretirement benefit post sale discount credit loss and income tax we have incorporated many year of data into the determination of each of these estimate and we have not historically experienced significant adjustment these assumption are reviewed at least annually with the audit committee of the board of director following are the method and assumption used in determining our estimate and an indication of the risk inherent in each residual value for leased asset the residual value of cat financial leased equipment is determined based on it estimated end of term market value we estimate the residual value of leased equipment at the inception of the lease based on number of factor including historical wholesale market sale price past remarketing experience and any known significant market product trend the following critical factor are also considered in our residual value estimate lease term market size and demand total expected hour of usage machine configuration application location model change quantity third party residual guarantee and contractual customer purchase option upon termination of the lease the equipment is either purchased by the lessee or sold to third party in which case we may record gain or loss for the difference between the estimated residual value and the sale price during the term of our lease we monitor residual value for operating lease adjustment to depreciation expense reflecting change in residual value estimate are recorded prospectively on straight line basis for finance lease residual value adjustment are recognized through reduction of finance revenue over the remaining lease term we evaluate the carrying value of equipment on operating lease for potential impairment when we determine triggering event ha occurred when triggering event occurs test for recoverability is performed by comparing projected undiscounted future cash flow to the carrying value of the equipment on operating lease if the test for recoverability identifies possible impairment the fair value of the equipment on operating lease is measured in accordance with the fair value measurement framework an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the equipment on operating lease exceeds it estimated fair value at december the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating lease wa billion without consideration of other factor such third party residual guarantee or contractual customer purchase option percent non temporary decrease in the market value of our equipment subject to operating lease would reduce residual value estimate and result in the recognition of approximately million of additional annual depreciation expense fair value for goodwill impairment test we test goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level and whenever event or circumstance make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred such significant adverse change in the business climate or decision to sell all or portion of reporting unit we perform our annual goodwill impairment test of october and monitor for interim triggering event on an ongoing basis goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing either qualitative assessment or quantitative goodwill impairment test if we choose to perform qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value no further evaluation is necessary for reporting unit where we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test we compare the fair value of each reporting unit which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flow to the respective carrying value which includes goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds it carrying value the goodwill is not considered impaired if the carrying value is higher than the fair value the difference would be recognized an impairment loss of contentsthe impairment test process requires valuation of the respective reporting unit which we primarily determine using an income approach based on discounted five year forecasted cash flow with year five residual value the residual value is computed using the constant growth method which value the forecasted cash flow in perpetuity the income approach is supported by reconciliation of our calculated fair value for caterpillar to the company market capitalization the assumption about future cash flow and growth rate are based on each reporting unit long term forecast and are subject to review and approval by senior management reporting unit discount rate is risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital which we believe approximates the rate from market participant perspective the estimated fair value could be impacted by change in market condition interest rate growth rate tax rate cost pricing and capital expenditure the fair value determination is categorized level in the fair value hierarchy due to it use of internal projection and unobservable measurement input our annual impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of indicated the fair value of each reporting unit wa substantially above it respective carrying value including goodwill caterpillar market capitalization ha remained significantly above the net book value of the company an unfavorable change in our expectation for the financial performance of our reporting unit particularly long term growth and profitability would reduce the fair value of our reporting unit the demand for our equipment and related part is highly cyclical and significantly impacted by commodity price although the impact may vary by reporting unit the energy and mining industry are major user of our product including the coal iron ore gold copper oil and natural gas industry decision to purchase our product are dependent upon the performance of those industry which in turn are dependent in part on commodity price lower commodity price or industry specific circumstance that have negative impact to the valuation assumption may reduce the fair value of our reporting unit should such event occur and it becomes more likely than not that reporting unit fair value ha fallen below it carrying value we will perform an interim goodwill impairment test in addition to the annual impairment test future impairment test may result in goodwill impairment depending on the outcome of the quantitative impairment test goodwill impairment would be reported non cash charge to earnings warranty liability at the time sale is recognized we record estimated future warranty cost the warranty liability is determined by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory generally historical claim rate are based on actual warranty experience for each product by machine model engine size by customer or dealer location inside or outside north america specific rate are developed for each product shipment month and are updated monthly based on actual warranty claim experience warranty cost may differ from those estimated if actual claim rate are higher or lower than our historical rate product liability and insurance loss reserve we determine these reserve based upon reported claim in process of settlement and actuarial estimate for loss incurred but not reported loss reserve including incurred but not reported reserve are based on estimate and ultimate settlement may vary significantly from such estimate due to increased claim frequency or severity over historical level postretirement benefit we sponsor defined benefit pension plan and or other postretirement benefit plan retirement healthcare and life insurance to employee in many of our location throughout the world there are assumption used in the accounting for these defined benefit plan that include discount rate expected return on plan asset expected rate of compensation increase the future health care trend rate mortality and other economic and demographic assumption the actuarial assumption we use may change or differ significantly from actual result which may result in material impact to our consolidated financial statement the effect of actual result differing from our assumption and the effect of changing assumption are considered actuarial gain or loss we utilize mark to market approach in recognizing actuarial gain or loss immediately through earnings upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter or on an interim basis triggering event warrant remeasurement primary actuarial assumption were determined follows the assumed discount rate is used to discount future benefit obligation back to today dollar the discount rate is based on benefit cash flow matching approach and represents the rate at which our benefit obligation could effectively be settled of our measurement date december the benefit cash flow matching approach involves analyzing caterpillar projected cash flow against high quality bond yield curve calculated using wide population of corporate aa bond available on the measurement date similar approach is used to determine the assumed discount rate for our most significant non plan in estimating the service and interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost we utilize full yield curve approach in determining discount rate this approach applies the specific spot rate along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flow of contentsdiscount rate are sensitive to change in interest rate decrease in the discount rate would increase our obligation and future expense the expected long term rate of return on plan asset is based on our estimate of long term passive return for equity and fixed income security weighted by the allocation of our plan asset based on historical performance we increase the passive return due to our active management of the plan asset this rate is impacted by change in general market condition but because it represents long term rate it is not significantly impacted by short term market swing change in our allocation of plan asset would also impact this rate for example shift to more fixed income security would lower the rate decrease in the rate would increase our expense the expected return on plan asset is calculated using the fair value of plan asset of our measurement date december the expected rate of compensation increase is used to develop benefit obligation using projected pay at retirement it represents average long term salary increase this rate is influenced by our long term compensation policy an increase in the rate would increase our obligation and expense the assumed health care trend rate represents the rate at which health care cost are assumed to increase and is based on historical and expected experience change in our projection of future health care cost due to general economic condition and those specific to health care technology driven cost change will impact this trend rate an increase in the trend rate would increase our obligation and expense the mortality assumption is used to estimate the life expectancy of plan participant an increase in the life expectancy of plan participant will result in an increase in our obligation and expense of content postretirement benefit plan actuarial assumption sensitivity the effect of one percentage point change in certain actuarial assumption on pension and

quarterly the reserve is adjusted if discount paid differ from those estimated historically those adjustment have not been material credit loss reserve the allowance for credit loss is an estimate of the loss inherent in our finance receivable portfolio and includes consideration of account that have been individually identified impaired well pool of finance receivables where it is probable that certain receivables in the pool are impaired but the individual account can not yet be identified in identifying and measuring impairment management take into consideration past loss experience known

individual review based on past due status and information available about the customer such financial statement news report and published credit rating well general information regarding industry trend and the economic environment in which our customer operate the allowance for credit loss attributable to finance receivables that are individually evaluated and determined to be impaired is based on the present value of expected future cash flow discounted at the receivables effective interest rate the fair value of the collateral for collateral dependent receivables or the observable market price of the receivable in determining collateral value we estimate the current fair market value of the collateral le selling cost we also consider credit enhancement such additional collateral and contractual third party guarantee the allowance for credit loss attributable to the remaining account not yet individually identified impaired is estimated based on loss forecast model utilizing probability of default our estimate of the loss emergence period and the estimated loss given default in addition qualitative factor not able to be fully captured in our loss forecast model including industry trend macroeconomic factor and model imprecision are considered in the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit loss these qualitative factor are subjective and require degree of management judgment while management belief it ha exercised prudent judgment and applied reasonable assumption there can be no assurance that in the future change in economic condition or other factor would not cause change in the financial health of our customer if the financial health of our customer deteriorates the timing and level of payment received could be impacted and therefore could result in change to our estimated loss income tax we are subject to the income tax law of the many jurisdiction in which we operate these tax law are complex and the manner in which they apply to our fact is sometimes open to interpretation in establishing the provision for income tax we must make judgment about the application of these inherently complex tax law our income tax position and analysis are based on currently enacted tax law future change in tax law or related interpretation could significantly impact the provision for income tax the amount of tax payable and the deferred tax asset and liability balance change in tax law are reflected in the period of enactment with related interpretation considered in the period received despite our belief that our tax return position are consistent with applicable tax law we believe that taxing authority could challenge certain position settlement of any challenge can result in no change complete disallowance or some partial adjustment reached through negotiation or litigation we record tax benefit for uncertain tax position based upon management evaluation of the information available at the reporting date to be recognized in the financial statement tax benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on technical merit the benefit for position meeting the recognition threshold is measured the largest benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with taxing authority that ha full knowledge of all relevant information significant judgment

form or assignment of income judicial doctrine csarl is primarily taxable locally in switzerland we are vigorously contesting the proposed increase to tax and penalty for these year of approximately billion we believe that the relevant transaction complied with applicable tax law and did not violate judicial doctrine the purchase of part by csarl from unrelated party and the subsequent sale of those part to unrelated dealer outside the united state have substantial legal commercial and economic consequence for the party involved therefore we have concluded that the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained related to this position is the entire benefit result no amount related to these irs adjustment is reflected in unrecognized tax benefit we have filed income tax return on this same basis for year after we currently believe the ultimate disposition of this matter will not have material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position liquidity

location often with other company pursuant to federal and state law when it is probable we will pay remedial cost at site and those cost can be reasonably estimated the investigation remediation and operating and maintenance cost are accrued against our earnings cost are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site including

loss gain net periodic benefit cost benefit expected net periodic benefit cost benefit doe not include an estimate for mark to market gain or loss expected decrease in expense in compared to excluding the impact of mark to market gain and loss our net periodic benefit cost is expected to decrease million in this decrease is primarily due to lower interest cost result of lower discount rate at year

net loss of million in the first quarter of for curtailment and termination benefit sensitivity foreign exchange rate sensitivity me operation use foreign currency forward and option contract to manage unmatched foreign currency cash inflow and outflow our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movement that would reduce the dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow our policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to approximately five year based on the anticipated and firmly committed cash inflow and outflow for our me operation for the next month and the foreign currency derivative instrument in place at year end hypothetical percent weakening of the dollar relative to all other currency would adversely affect our expected cash flow for our me operation by approximately million last year similar assumption and calculation yielded potential million adverse impact on cash flow we determine our net exposure by calculating the difference in cash inflow and outflow by currency and adding or subtracting outstanding foreign currency derivative instrument we multiply these net amount by percent to determine the sensitivity in managing foreign currency risk for our financial product operation our objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet position and future transaction denominated in foreign currency since our policy allows the use of foreign currency forward option and cross currency contract to offset the risk of currency mismatch between our asset and liability and exchange rate risk associated with future transaction denominated in foreign currency percent change in the value of the dollar relative to all other currency would not have material effect on our consolidated financial position result of operation or cash flow neither our policy the effect of percent change in the value of the dollar ha changed from that reported at the end of last year the effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rate ignores the effect this movement may have on other variable including competitive risk if it were possible to quantify this competitive impact the result would probably be different from the sensitivity effect shown above in addition it is unlikely that all currency would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the dollar in reality some currency may weaken while others may strengthen our primary exposure excluding competitive risk is to exchange rate movement in the swiss franc chinese yuan japanese yen indian rupee and australian dollar interest rate sensitivity for our me operation we have the option to use interest rate contract to lower the cost of borrowed fund by attaching fixed to floating interest rate contract to fixed rate debt and by entering into forward rate agreement on future debt issuance hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rate along the entire interest rate yield curve would have minimal impact to the pre tax earnings of me last year similar assumption and calculation yielded minimal impact to pre tax earnings of contentsfor our financial product operation we use interest rate derivative instrument primarily to meet our match funding objective and strategy we have match funding policy that address the interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile fixed or floating rate and duration of our debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of our finance receivable portfolio within predetermined range on an ongoing basis in connection with that policy we use interest rate derivative instrument to modify the debt structure to match asset within the finance receivable portfolio match funding reduces the volatility of margin between interest bearing asset and interest bearing liability regardless of which direction interest rate move in order to properly manage sensitivity to change in interest rate financial product measure the potential impact of different interest rate assumption on pre tax earnings all on balance sheet position including derivative financial instrument are included in the analysis the primary assumption included in the analysis are that there are no new fixed rate asset or liability the proportion of fixed rate debt to fixed rate asset remains unchanged and the level of floating rate asset and debt remain constant an analysis of the december balance sheet using these assumption estimate the impact of basis point immediate and sustained adverse change in interest rate to have minimal impact on pre tax earnings last year similar assumption and calculation yielded minimal impact to pre tax earnings this analysis doe not necessarily represent our current outlook of future market interest rate movement nor doe it consider any action management could undertake in response to change in interest rate accordingly no assurance can be given that actual result would be consistent with the result of our estimate non gaap financial measuresthe following definition are provided for the non gaap financial measure used in this report these non gaap financial measure have no standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of similar measure for other company management doe not intend these item to be considered in

and tax law valuation allowance are recorded to reduce deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that tax benefit will not be realized see note for further discussion goodwill for acquisition accounted for business combination goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of the net asset acquired we are required to test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually and when event or circumstance make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to component to which goodwill is assigned when initially recorded we assign goodwill to reporting unit based on our integration plan and the expected synergy resulting from the acquisition because caterpillar is highly integrated company the business we acquire are sometimes combined with or integrated into existing reporting unit when change occur in the composition of our operating segment or reporting unit goodwill is reassigned to the affected reporting unit based on their relative fair value we perform our annual goodwill impairment test of october and monitor for interim triggering event on an ongoing basis goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing either qualitative assessment or quantitative goodwill impairment test if we choose to perform qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value no further evaluation is necessary for reporting unit where we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test we compare the fair value of each reporting unit which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flow to the respective carrying value which includes goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds it carrying value the goodwill is not considered impaired if the carrying value is higher than the fair value the difference would be recognized an impairment loss see note for further detail estimate in financial statement the preparation of financial statement in conformity with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state of

weighted average target allocation are percent fixed income percent equity percent real estate and percent other the target allocation for each plan vary based upon local statutory requirement demographic of plan participant and funded status the non plan asset are primarily invested in non security our target allocation for the other postretirement benefit plan is percent equity and

reflect market data obtained from independent source while unobservable input lowest level reflect internally developed market assumption in accordance with this guidance fair value measurement are classified under the following hierarchy level quoted price for identical instrument in active market level quoted price for similar instrument in active market quoted price for identical or similar instrument in market that are not active and model derived valuation in which all significant input or significant value driver are observable in active market level model derived valuation in which one or more significant input or significant value driver are unobservable when available we use quoted market price to determine fair value and we classify such measurement within level in some case where market price are not available we make use of observable market based input to calculate fair value in which case the measurement are classified within level if quoted or observable market price are not available fair value is based upon valuation in which one or more significant input are unobservable including internally developed model that use where possible current market based parameter such interest rate yield curve and currency rate these measurement are classified within level fair value measurement are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is

investigation remediation and operating and maintenance cost are accrued against our earnings cost are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site including available technology current applicable law and regulation and prior remediation experience where no amount within range of estimate is more likely we accrue the minimum where multiple potentially responsible party are involved we consider our proportionate share of the probable cost in formulating the estimate of probable cost we do not consider amount expected to be
