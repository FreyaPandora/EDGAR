system we deliver our signal via fiber optic cable from the headend to group of node and use coaxial cable to deliver the signal from individual node to the home served by that node for our spectrum enterprise customer fiber optic cable is extended from individual node to the customer site for certain new build and mdu site we increasingly bring fiber to the customer site our design standard allows spare fiber strand to each node to be utilized for additional residential traffic capacity and enterprise customer need they arise we believe that this hybrid network design provides high capacity and signal quality hfc architecture benefit include bandwidth capacity to enable traditional and two way video and broadband service dedicated bandwidth for two way service and signal quality and high service reliability our system provide two way all digital platform leveraging docsis technology and bandwidth of megahertz or greater to approximately of our estimated passing this bandwidth rich network enables to offer large selection of hd channel and spectrum internet gig while providing greater plant security and enabling lower installation and disconnect service truck roll we believe demand for data continues to grow that with our deployed docsis technology we have the ability to increase speed and reliability by allocating more of our plant bandwidth to both upstream and downstream ip service in variety of way including moving our video service to mpeg compression moving more hd video content to switched digital video and more efficiently packaging our non ip service

network build out based on disciplined cost reduction target we also participated in phase of the rural digital opportunity fund rdof auction to extend our broadband service in state where we currently operate the purpose of phase of rdof wa to bring broadband to unserved area approximately billion wa awarded nationwide in phase of rdof through reverse auction process of which we bidding process for billion in december we expect to fund our multi billion dollar fiber based build out over six to eight year period this investment will allow to generate long term infrastructure style return by further taking advantage of the efficiency of the scale and quality of our network and construction capability while offering our high quality product and service to more home and business we expect newly served home will be enabled to engage in distance learning remote work telemedicine and other bandwidth heavy application that require high speed broadband connectivity newly served rural area would also benefit from our high value spp structure including our voice and mobile offering well our comprehensive selection of video product the successful and timely execution of such build out is dependent on variety of external factor including the make ready and utility pole permitting process with fewer home business in these area broadband provider need to access multiple pole per home opposed to multiple home per pole in higher density setting result pole application pole replacement rule and their affiliated issue resolution process are all factor that can have significant impact on build out timing and speed to completion the rdof auction rule establish construction milestone for the build out utilizing rdof funding failure to meet those milestone could subject the company to financial penalty management customer operation and marketing our operation are centralized with senior executive responsible for coordinating and overseeing operation including

vod programming increase in the cost of sport programming and the amount paid for broadcast station retransmission consent have been the largest contributor to the growth in our programming cost over the last year additionally the demand of large medium company who link carriage of their most popular network to carriage and cost increase of their le popular network and who require to carry their most popular network to large percentage of our video subscriber have limited our flexibility in creating more tailored and cost sensitive programming package for consumer federal law allows commercial television broadcast station to make an election between must carry right and an alternative retransmission consent regime when station opts for retransmission consent we are not allowed to carry the station signal without that station permission continuing demand by owner of broadcast station for cash payment at substantial increase over amount paid in prior year in exchange for retransmission consent will increase our programming cost or require to cease carriage of popular programming potentially leading to loss of customer in affected service area over the past several year increase in our video service rate have not fully offset the increase in our programming cost and with the impact of increasing competition and other marketplace factor we not expect the increase in our video service rate to fully offset the increase in our programming cost per customer for the foreseeable future although we pas along portion of amount paid for retransmission consent to the majority of our customer our inability to fully pas programming cost increase on to our video customer ha and is expected in the future to have an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating margin associated with our video product in order to mitigate reduction of our operating margin due to rapidly increasing programming cost we continue to review our pricing and programming packaging strategy our programming contract are generally for fixed period of time usually for multiple year and are subject to negotiated renewal the contract set to expire in any particular year vary we will seek to renew these agreement on term that we believe are favorable there can be no assurance however that these agreement will be renewed on favorable or comparable term to the extent that we are unable to reach agreement with certain programmer on term that we believe are reasonable we have been and may in the future be forced to remove such programming channel from our line up which may result in loss of customer competitionresidential serviceswe face intense competition for residential customer both from existing competitor and result of the rapid development of new technology service and product

apartment complex and private residential community business serviceswe face intense competition across each of our business service product offering our smb internet video networking and voice service face competition from variety of provider described our enterprise solution also face competition from the competitor described above well application service provider and other telecommunication carrier such metro and regional fiber based carrier advertisingwe face intense competition for advertising revenue across many different platform and from wide range of local and national competitor advertising competition ha increased and will likely continue to increase new advertising avenue seek to attract the same advertiser we compete for advertising revenue against among others local broadcast station national cable and broadcast network radio station print medium and online advertising company and content provider seasonality and cyclicality our business is subject to seasonal and cyclical variation our result are impacted by the seasonal nature of customer receiving our cable service in college and vacation service area our revenue is subject to cyclical advertising pattern and change in viewership level our advertising revenue is generally higher in the second and fourth calendar quarter of each year due in part to increase in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season advertising revenue is also cyclical benefiting in even numbered year from advertising related to candidate running for political office and issue oriented advertising our capital expenditure and trade working capital are also subject to significant seasonality based on the timing of subscriber growth network program specific project and construction regulation and legislation the following summary address the key regulatory and legislative development affecting the cable industry and our service for both residential and commercial customer cable system and related communication network and service are extensively regulated by the federal government primarily the fcc certain state government and many local government failure to comply with these regulation could subject to substantial penalty our business can be dramatically impacted by change to the existing regulatory framework whether triggered by legislative administrative or judicial ruling congress and the fcc have frequently revisited the subject of communication regulation and they are likely to do in the future change in legislation regulation and regulatory enforcement are expected to result from the recent political election we could be materially disadvantaged in the future if we are subject to new law regulation or regulatory action that do not equally impact our key competitor for example internet delivered streaming video service compete with our traditional video service but they are not subject to the same level of federal state and local regulation we can not provide assurance that the already extensive regulation of our business will not be expanded in the future in addition we are subject to charter specific condition regarding certain business practice result of the fcc approval of the merger in with time warner cable inc twc and acquisition of bright house network llc bright house video servicemust carry retransmission consentthere are two alternative legal method for carriage of local broadcast television station on cable system federal must carry regulation require cable system to carry local broadcast television station upon the request of the local broadcaster alternatively federal law includes retransmission consent regulation by which popular commercial television station can prohibit cable carriage unless the cable operator first negotiates for retransmission consent which may be conditioned on significant payment or other concession popular station invoking retransmission consent have been demanding compensation increase in their recent negotiation with cable operator thereby significantly increasing our operating cost pole attachmentsthe communication act of amended the communication act requires most utility owning utility pole to provide cable system with access to pole and conduit and also subject the rate charged for this access to either federal or state regulation the federally regulated rate now applicable to pole attachment used for cable internet and telecommunication service are substantially similar the fcc approach doe not directly affect the rate in state that self regulate but many of those state have substantially the same rate for all communication attachment cable rate regulationpursuant to federal law cable system video offering are universally exempt from rate regulation except for cable system minimum level of video programming service referred to basic service and associated equipment fcc regulation require local franchise authority interested in regulating rate for basic service and associated equipment to first make an affirmative showing that there is no effective competition defined under federal law in the community given the competitive nature of our market the fcc recently rescinded certification for the relatively few community where we had been subject to rate regulation it is possible that this rescission could be reversed the competitive situation could change and that some local franchising authority may be certified to regulate rate in the future in addition the television viewer consumer protection act of and other existing and potential law and regulation may affect our marketing practice including our disclosure and itemization of subscriber fee other fcc regulatory mattersthe communication act and fcc regulation cover variety of additional area applicable to our video service including among other thing licensing of system and facility including the grant of various spectrum license equal employment opportunity obligation customer service standard technical service standard mandatory blackout of certain network and syndicated programming restriction on political advertising restriction on advertising in child programming ownership restriction maintenance of public file emergency alert system inside wiring and exclusive contract for mdu complex disability access including requirement governing video description and closed captioning competitive availability of cable equipment the provision of up to of video channel capacity for commercial leased access by unaffiliated third party and public education and government entity access requirement each of these regulation restricts our business practice to varying degree and may impose additional cost on our operation the fcc regulates spectrum usage in way that could impact our operation for example the fcc ha adopted plan to reallocate certain spectrum for new wireless communication purpose which could be disruptive to the satellite platform we rely upon to provide our video service the fcc is also preparing to make additional spectrum available for commercial service which we might acquire to deliver service in the future our ability to access and use such spectrum is uncertain and may be limited by further fcc auction or allocation decision new spectrum obtained by other party could also lead to additional wireless competition to our existing and future service it is possible that congress or the fcc will expand or modify it regulation of cable system and competing service in the future and we can not predict at this time how that might impact our business copyrightcable system are subject to federal compulsory copyright license covering carriage of television and radio broadcast signal the copyright law provides copyright owner the right to audit our payment under the compulsory license and the copyright office is currently considering modification to the license royalty calculation and reporting obligation the possible modification or elimination of this license is the subject of continuing legislative proposal and administrative review and could adversely affect our ability to obtain desired broadcast programming franchise mattersour cable system generally are operated pursuant to nonexclusive franchise permit and similar authorization granted by municipality or other state or local government entity in order to utilize and cross public right of way franchise generally are granted for fixed term and in many case include monetary penalty for noncompliance and may be terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provision the specific term and condition of cable franchise vary significantly between jurisdiction they generally contain provision governing cable operation franchise fee system construction maintenance technical performance customer service standard supporting and carrying public access channel and change in the ownership of the franchisee although local franchising authority have considerable discretion in establishing franchise term certain federal protection benefit cable operator for example federal law imposes cap on franchise fee in the fcc clarified that in kind contribution requirement set forth in cable franchise are subject to the statutory cap on franchise fee and it reaffirmed that state and local authority are barred from imposing duplicative franchise and or fee requirement on franchised cable system providing non cable service an appeal of the fcc order is pending in federal court number of state have adopted franchising law that provide for statewide franchising generally state wide cable franchise are issued for fixed term streamline many of the traditional local cable franchise requirement and eliminate local negotiation the communication act provides for an orderly franchise renewal process in which granting authority may not unreasonably deny renewal if we fail to obtain renewal of franchise representing significant number of our customer it could have material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition result of operation or our liquidity similarly if franchising authority consent is required for the purchase or sale of cable system the franchising authority may attempt to impose more burdensome requirement condition for providing it consent internet servicethe fcc originally classified broadband internet access service such those we offer an information service which exempted the service from traditional communication common carrier law and regulation in the fcc reclassified broadband internet access service telecommunication service and on that basis imposed number of net neutrality rule governing the provision of broadband service in the fcc reversed it decision and eliminated the rule other than transparency requirement which obligates to disclose performance statistic and other service information to consumer it is possible that the fcc might again revise it approach to broadband internet access or that congress might enact legislation affecting the rule applicable to the service the application of new legal requirement to our internet service could adversely affect our business the fcc decision reclassifying internet access service also ruled that state regulator may not impose obligation similar to federal network neutrality obligation that the fcc eliminated but this blanket prohibition wa vacated by the court of appeal in the court left open the possibility that individual state law could be deemed preempted on case by case basis if it is shown that they conflict with federal law several state including california have adopted state obligation and additional state may consider the imposition of new regulation on our internet service such rule similar to the network neutrality requirement that were eliminated by the fcc california legislation ha been challenged in court and we can not predict how the challenge to california legislation or challenge to other state legislation will be resolved in recent year the fcc ha demonstrated an interest in accelerating advancement in and deployment of wired and wireless broadband infrastructure including advanced wireless service for example the fcc and many state offer subsidy to company deploying broadband to area deemed to be unserved or underserved including the recently concluded rdof auction we have sought subsidy for our own broadband construction in unserved area and we have opposed such subsidy when directed to area that are already served government effort to subsidize area that we already serve create regulatory imbalance that could adversely affect our business aside from the fcc generally applicable regulation we made certain commitment to comply with the fcc order in connection with the fcc approval of the merger with twc and acquisition of bright house wireline voice servicethe fcc ha never classified the voip wireline telephone service we offer telecommunication service that are subject to traditional federal common carrier regulation but instead ha imposed some of these requirement on case by case basis such requirement relating to emergency service communication assistance for law enforcement act calea the statute governing law enforcement access to and surveillance of communication universal service fund contribution customer privacy and customer proprietary network information protection number portability network outage reporting rural call completion disability access regulatory fee back up power obligation robocall mitigation and of service it is possible that the fcc or congress will impose additional requirement on our voip telephone service in the future our voip telephone service are also subject to certain state and local regulatory fee such fee and contribution to state universal service fund although we believe that voip telephone service should otherwise be governed only by federal regulation some state have attempted to subject cable voip service to state level regulation and at least one state ha asserted jurisdiction over our voip service we prevailed on legal challenge to that state assertion of jurisdiction which wa affirmed by federal appellate court but that ruling is limited to the seven state in the circuit although we have registered with or obtained certificate or authorization from the fcc and the state regulatory authority in those state in which we offer competitive voice service in order to ensure the continuity of our service it is unclear whether and how these and other ongoing regulatory matter ultimately will be resolved state regulatory commission and legislature in other jurisdiction may continue to consider imposing regulatory requirement on our fixed telephone service mobile service our spectrum mobile service offer mobile internet access and telephone service we provide this service an mvno using verizon network and our network through spectrum wifi an mvno we are subject to many of the same fcc regulation that apply to facility based wireless carrier well certain state or local regulation including but not limited to local number portability customer privacy calea universal service fund contribution robocall mitigation and hearing aid compatibility and safety and emission requirement for mobile device spectrum mobile broadband internet access service is also subject to the fcc transparency rule the fcc or other regulatory authority may adopt new or different regulation for mvnos and or mobile service provider in the future or impose new tax or fee applicable to spectrum mobile which could adversely affect the service offering or our business generally privacy and information security regulationthe communication act limit our ability to collect use and disclose customer personally identifiable information for our internet video and voice service we are subject to additional federal state and local law and regulation that impose additional restriction on the collection use and disclosure of consumer information all broadband provider are also obliged by calea to configure their network in manner that facilitates the ability of state and federal law enforcement with proper legal process authorized under the electronic communication privacy act to obtain record and information concerning our customer including the content of their communication further the fcc federal trade commission ftc and many state regulate and restrict the marketing practice of communication service provider including telemarketing and sending unsolicited commercial email the ftc currently ha the authority pursuant to it general authority to enforce against unfair or deceptive act and practice to protect the privacy of internet service customer including our use and disclosure of certain customer information our operation are also subject to federal and state law governing information security in the event of an information security breach such rule may require consumer and government agency notification and may result in regulatory enforcement action with the potential of monetary forfeiture the fcc the ftc and state attorney general regularly bring enforcement action against company related to information security breach and privacy violation various security standard provide guidance to telecommunication company in order to help identify and mitigate cybersecurity risk one such standard is the voluntary framework released by the national institute for standard and technology nist in and updated in in cooperation with other federal agency and owner and operator of critical infrastructure the nist cybersecurity framework provides prioritized and flexible model for organization to identify and manage cyber risk inherent to their business it wa designed to supplement not supersede existing cybersecurity regulation and requirement several government agency have encouraged compliance with the nist cybersecurity framework including the fcc which is also considering expansion of it cybersecurity guideline or the adoption of cybersecurity requirement we voluntarily follow nist part of our overall cybersecurity program many state and local authority have considered legislative or other action that would impose restriction on our ability to collect use and disclose and safeguard certain consumer information particularly with regard to our broadband internet business for example the california consumer privacy act ccpa and maine act to protect privacy of online customer information both became effective in the ccpa under certain circumstance regulates company use and disclosure of the personal information of california resident and authorizes enforcement action by the california attorney general and private class action for data breach in addition effective january the california consumer privacy right act cpra adopted by ballot initiative in will amend the ccpa to impose additional obligation on that handle the personal information of california resident the maine law regulates how internet service provider use and disclose customer personal information and requires internet service provider to take reasonable measure to protect customer personal information several other state legislature are considering the adoption of new data security and cybersecurity legislation that could result in additional network and information security requirement for our business congress may also adopt new privacy and data security obligation we can not predict whether any of these effort will be successful or preempted or how new legislation and regulation if any would affect our business commitment related to the merger with twc and acquisition of bright housein connection with approval of the merger with twc and acquisition of bright house the transaction federal and state regulator imposed number of post transaction condition on including but not limited to the following fcc condition offer settlement free internet interconnection to any party that meet the requirement of our interconnection policy available on charter website on term generally consistent with the policy for seven year with possible reduction to five year from fcc approval in pursuant to judgment by the federal appeal court for the circuit this condition became invalid in october deploy and offer high speed broadband internet access service to an additional two million location over five year we reported to the fcc in october that this condition had been satisfied refrain from charging usage based price or imposing data cap on any fixed mass market broadband internet access service plan for seven year offer mbps discounted broadband where technically feasible to eligible customer throughout our service area for four year from the offer commencement pursuant to judgment by the federal appeal court for the circuit this condition became invalid in october and continue to provide cablecards to any new or existing customer upon request for use in third party retail device for four year and continue to support such cablecards for seven year in each case unless the fcc change the relevant rule the obligation to continue to provide cablecards expired in may the fcc condition also contain number of compliance reporting requirement doj conditionsthe doj order prohibits from entering into or enforcing any agreement with video programmer that forbids limit or creates incentive to limit the video programmer provision of content to online video distributor ovds we will not be able to avail of other distributor most favored nation mfn provision if they are inconsistent with this prohibition the doj condition are effective for seven year after entry of the final judgment in although we may petition the doj to eliminate the condition after five year we do not currently expect to so petition state conditionscertain state regulator including california new york hawaii and new jersey also imposed condition in connection with the approval of the transaction these condition include requirement related to building out our network to certain household and business location that are not currently served by cable within the designated state offering lifeline service discount and low income broadband to eligible household served within the applicable state investing in service improvement program and customer service enhancement and maintaining customer facing job within the designated state and complying with reporting requirement we believe we have either completed or are on track to complete these state

employee item risk factor risk related to our businesswe operate in competitive business environment which affect our ability to attract and retain customer and can adversely affect our business operation and financial result the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and ha become more so in recent year in some instance we compete against company with fewer regulatory burden access to better financing greater personnel resource greater resource for marketing greater and more favorable brand name recognition and long established relationship with regulatory authority and customer increasing consolidation in the telecommunication and content industry have provided additional benefit to certain of our competitor either through access to financing resource or efficiency of scale including the ability to launch new video service our internet service face competition from the phone company ftth fttn fixed wireless broadband internet delivered via satellite and dsl service various operator offer wireless internet service delivered over network which they continue to enhance to deliver faster speed and also continue to expand mobile service our voice and mobile service compete wireless and wireline phone provider well other form of communication such text instant messaging social networking service video conferencing and email competition from these company including intensive marketing effort with aggressive pricing and exclusive programming may have an adverse impact on our ability to attract and retain customer our video service face competition from number of source including db service and company that deliver linear network programming movie and television show on demand and other video content over broadband internet connection to television computer tablet and mobile device often with password sharing among multiple user and security that make content susceptible to piracy newer product and service particularly alternative method for the distribution sale and viewing of content will likely continue to be developed further increasing the number of competitor that we face the increasing number of choice available to audience including low cost or free choice could negatively impact not only consumer demand for our product and service but also advertiser willingness to purchase advertising from we compete for the sale of advertising revenue with television network and station well other advertising platform such online medium radio and print competition related to our service offering to business continues to increase well more company deploy more fiber to more building which may negatively impact our growth and or put pressure on margin our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to new technology and change in customer expectation and behavior could significantly adversely affect our competitive position with respect to the leisure time and discretionary spending of our customer and result affect our business and result of operation competition may also reduce our expected growth of future cash flow which may contribute to future impairment of our franchise and goodwill and our ability to meet cash flow requirement including debt service requirement for additional information regarding the competition we face see item business competition and regulation and legislation the ongoing covid pandemic could materially affect our financial condition and result of operation the ongoing covid pandemic ha increased economic and demand uncertainty the current pandemic and continued spread of covid ha caused an economic recession at this time we can not predict the duration of any business disruption and the ultimate impact of covid on our business including the depth and duration of the economic impact to household formation and growth our residential and business customer ability to pay for our product and service including the impact of extended unemployment benefit and other stimulus package and the long term impact on our business including from consumer behavior after the pandemic is over we expect that some of the covid program may result in incremental churn and bad debt in in addition there is uncertainty regarding the impact of government emergency declaration the ability of our supplier and vendor to provide product and service to the pace of new housing construction change in business spend in our local and national ad sale business the effect to our employee health and safety and resulting reorientation of our work activity and the risk of limitation on the deployment and maintenance of our service including by limiting our customer support and on site service repair and installation the degree to which covid impact our result will depend on future development which are highly uncertain and can not be predicted including but not limited to the duration and spread of the outbreak it severity the action to contain the virus or treat it impact the timing of approval and distribution of vaccine and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating condition can resume programming cost per video customer are rising at faster rate than wage or inflation and we may not have the ability to reduce or moderate the growth rate of or pas on to our customer our increasing programming cost which would adversely affect our cash flow and operating margin video programming ha been and is expected to continue to be our largest operating expense item medium corporation and broadcast station group consolidation ha resulted in fewer supplier and additional selling power on the part of programming supplier we expect programming rate per video customer will continue to increase due to variety of factor including annual increase imposed by programmer with additional selling power result of medium and broadcast station group consolidation increased demand by owner of broadcast station for payment for retransmission consent or linking carriage of other service to retransmission consent and additional programming particularly new service the inability to fully pas programming cost increase on to our customer ha had and is expected in the future to have an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating margin associated with the video product programming contract often restrict the structure of the video package we offer which impact the affordability and competitive positioning of our video service the contract set to expire in any particular year vary there can be no assurance that these agreement will be renewed on favorable or comparable term in addition number of programmer have begun to sell their service through alternative distribution channel including ip based platform which are le secure than our own video distribution platform there is growing evidence that these le secure video distribution platform are leading to video product theft via password sharing among consumer password sharing may drive the number of customer who pay for certain programming putting programmer revenue at risk and which in may cause certain programmer to seek even higher programming fee from the ability for consumer to receive the same content for free through such unauthorized channel ha devalued our video product which could impact sale customer retention and our ability to pas through programming cost to consumer which increase the risk of non renewal when programmer seek increase to the extent that we are unable to reach agreement with certain programmer on term that we believe are reasonable we have been and may be in the future forced to remove such programming channel from our line up which may result in loss of customer our failure to carry programming that is attractive to our customer could adversely impact our customer level operation and financial result in addition if our internet customer are unable to access desirable content online content provider block or limit access by our customer class our ability to gain and retain customer especially internet customer may be negatively impacted increased demand by owner of some broadcast station for carriage of other service or payment to those broadcaster for retransmission consent are likely to further increase our programming cost federal law allows commercial television broadcast station to make an election between must carry right and an alternative retransmission consent regime when station opts for the retransmission consent regime we are not allowed to carry the station signal without that station permission in some case we carry station under short term arrangement while we attempt to negotiate new long term retransmission agreement if negotiation with these programmer prove unsuccessful they could require to cease carrying their signal possibly for an indefinite period any loss of station could make our video service le attractive to customer which could result in le subscription and advertising revenue in retransmission consent negotiation broadcaster often condition consent with respect to one station on carriage of one or more other station or programming service in which they or their affiliate have an interest carriage of these other service well increased fee for retransmission right may increase our programming expense and diminish the amount of capacity we have available to introduce new service which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial result our inability to respond to technological development and meet customer demand for new product and service could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively we operate in highly competitive consumer driven and rapidly changing environment from time to time we may pursue strategic initiative to launch product or enhancement to our product our success is to large extent dependent on our ability to acquire develop adopt upgrade and exploit new and existing technology to address consumer changing demand and distinguish our service from those of our competitor we may not be able to accurately predict technological trend or the success of new product and service if we choose technology or equipment that are le effective cost efficient or attractive to customer than those chosen by our competitor if technology or equipment on which we have chosen to rely cease to be available to on reasonable term or condition if we offer service that fail to appeal to consumer are not available at competitive price or that do not function expected or we are not able to fund the expenditure necessary to keep pace with technological development or if we are no longer able to make our service available to our customer on third party device on which substantial number of customer have relied to access our service our competitive position could deteriorate and our business and financial result could suffer the ability of some of our competitor to introduce new technology product and service more quickly than we do may adversely affect our competitive position furthermore advance in technology decrease in the cost of existing technology or change in competitor product and service offering may require in the future to make additional research and development expenditure or to offer at no additional charge or at lower price certain product and service that we currently offer to customer separately or at premium in addition the uncertainty of our ability and the cost to obtain intellectual property right from third party could impact our ability to respond to technological advance in timely and effective manner our inability to maintain and expand our upgraded system and provide advanced service in timely manner or to anticipate the demand of the marketplace could materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customer in addition we continue to grow our mobile service using virtual network operator right from third party we expect continued growth related sale and marketing and other customer acquisition cost well negative working capital impact from the timing of device related cash flow when we provide device pursuant to equipment installation plan we also continue to consider and pursue opportunity in the mobile space which may include the acquisition of additional licensed spectrum and may include entering into or expanding joint venture or partnership with wireless or cable provider which may require significant investment for example we now hold cbr pal to support existing and future mobile service these license are subject to revocation and expiration although we expect to be able to maintain and renew these license the loss of one or more license could significantly impair our ability to offload mobile traffic and achieve cost reduction if we are unable to continue to grow our mobile business and achieve the outcome we expect from our investment in the mobile business our growth financial condition and result of operation could be adversely affected depend on third party service provider supplier and licensors thus if we are unable to procure the necessary service equipment software or license on reasonable term and on timely basis our ability to offer service could be impaired and our growth operation business financial result and financial condition could be materially adversely affected we

could adversely affect our business regulation of the cable industry ha increased cable operator operational and administrative expense and limited their revenue cable operator are subject to numerous law and regulation including those covering the following the provision of high speed internet service including net neutrality and transparency rule the provision of voice communication cable franchise renewal and transfer the provisioning and marketing of cable and internet equipment customer and employee privacy and data security copyright royalty for retransmitting broadcast signal when cable system must carry particular broadcast station and when it must first obtain retransmission consent to carry broadcast station limitation on our ability to enter into exclusive agreement with multiple dwelling unit complex and control our inside wiring equal employment opportunity emergency alert system disability access pole attachment commercial leased access and technical standard marketing practice customer service and consumer protection and approval for merger and acquisition often accompanied by the imposition of restriction and requirement on an applicant business in order to secure approval of the proposed transaction legislator and regulator at all level of government frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing statute rule regulation or interpretation thereof or prescribe new one any future legislative judicial regulatory or administrative action may increase our cost or impose additional restriction on our business change to existing statute rule regulation or interpretation thereof or adoption of new one could have an adverse effect on our business there are ongoing effort to amend or expand the federal state and local regulation of some of the service offered over our cable system which may compound the regulatory risk we already face for example with respect to our retail broadband internet access service the fcc ha reclassified the service twice in the last few year with the first change adding federal obligation and the second change largely removing those new regulatory obligation change in administration and new congress in may result in the imposition of obligation through legislation or regulation other potential legislative and regulatory change could adversely impact our business by increasing our cost and competition and limiting our ability to offer service in manner that that would maximize our revenue potential these change could include for example the adoption of new privacy restriction on our collection use and disclosure of certain customer information new data security and cybersecurity mandate that could result in additional network and information security requirement for our business new restraint on our discretion over programming decision new restriction on the rate we charge for video programming and the marketing and packaging of that video programming and other service to consumer change to the cable industry compulsory copyright license to carry broadcast signal new requirement to assure the availability of navigation device such digital receiver from third party provider new universal service fund obligation on our provision of internet service that would add to the cost of that service increase in government administered broadband subsidy to rural area that could result in subsidized overbuilding of our more rural facility change to the fcc administration of spectrum and change in the regulatory framework for voip phone service including the scope of regulatory obligation associated with our voip service and our ability to interconnect our voip service with incumbent provider of traditional telecommunication service if any of these such law or regulation are enacted they could affect our operation and require significant expenditure we can not predict future development in these area and any change to the regulatory framework for our internet video or voip service could have negative impact on our business and result of operation it remains uncertain what rule change if any will ultimately be adopted by congress and the fcc and what operating or financial impact any such rule might have on including on our programming agreement customer privacy and the user experience in addition the fcc the ftc and various state agency and attorney general actively investigate industry practice and could impose substantial forfeiture for alleged regulatory violation tax legislation and administrative initiative or challenge to our tax and fee position could adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition we operate cable system in location throughout the united state and result we are subject to the tax law and regulation of federal state and local government from time to time legislative and administrative body change law and regulation that change our effective tax rate or tax payment for instance there are initiative at the federal level to reverse the corporate tax cut in the favorable tax cut and job act of certain state and locality have imposed or are considering imposing new or additional tax or fee on our service or changing the methodology or base on which certain fee and tax are computed potential change include additional tax or fee on our service which could impact our customer change to income tax sourcing rule and other change to general business tax central unit level assessment of property tax and other matter that could increase our income franchise sale use and or property tax liability for example some local franchising authority are seeking to impose franchise fee assessment on our broadband internet access service in addition to our video service and more may do so in the future if they do so and challenge to such assessment are unsuccessful it could adversely impact our cost although the fcc issued decision precluding the imposition of such duplicative fee that favorable decision is currently subject to judicial review in addition federal state and local tax law and regulation are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretation there can be no assurance that our tax position will not be challenged by relevant tax authority or that we would be successful in any such challenge our cable system franchise are subject to non renewal or termination and are non exclusive the failure to renew franchise or the grant of additional franchise in one or more service area could adversely affect our business our cable system generally operate pursuant to franchise permit and similar authorization issued by state or local governmental authority controlling the public right of way many franchise establish comprehensive facility and service requirement well specific customer service standard and monetary penalty for non compliance in many case franchise are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with significant provision set forth in the franchise agreement governing system operation franchise are generally granted for fixed term and must be periodically renewed franchising authority may resist granting renewal if either past performance or the prospective operating proposal is considered inadequate franchise authority often demand concession or other commitment condition to renewal in some instance local franchise have not been renewed at expiration and we have operated and are operating under either temporary operating agreement or without franchise while negotiating renewal term with the local franchising authority can not assure you that we will be able to comply with all significant provision of our franchise agreement and certain of our franchisers have from time to time alleged that we have not complied with these agreement additionally although historically we have renewed our franchise without incurring significant cost we can not assure you that we will be able to renew or to renew favorably our franchise in the future termination of or sustained failure to renew franchise in one or more service area could adversely affect our business in the affected geographic area our cable system franchise are non exclusive consequently local and state franchising authority can grant additional franchise to competitor in the same geographic area or operate their own cable system in some

customer base in an effort to assist covid impacted customer with overdue balance at the end of the kac and certain state mandated program we waived approximately million of receivables which wa recorded reduction of revenue the interruption of professional sport season resulted in million lower programming expense result of estimated sport rebate from sport programming network result of

some expense that otherwise would have been recognized in to and beyond in the third quarter of we recognized million of estimated credit that we intend to provide on our customer invoice related to the rebate to be received from sport programming network the difference between the estimated credit and the estimated rebate is due to an expected reduction in sport right content cost which is being amortized over the life of the contract economic condition and temporary closure or reduction in operation of business resulted in reduced advertising spend and lower revenue from seasonal plan offered to smb and enterprise hospitality customer that have requested reduced level of service due to temporary business closure or because these customer have reduced their service offering to their own customer seasonal plan despite the economic condition we saw improved collection of residential customer receivables which we believe were enhanced by government stimulus benefit we expect bad debt expense and churn in to return to pre pandemic level we increased wage for all hourly field operation and customer service call center employee and gave our employee additional paid sick time for covid related illness and flex time program to address other covid issue we also committed to raise our minimum starting wage for hourly employee to an hour over the next year through accelerated

ability to pay for our product and service including the impact of extended unemployment benefit and other stimulus package and the long term impact on our business including from consumer behavior after the pandemic is over some of the covid program discussed above may result in incremental churn and bad debt in and may have accelerated demand into in addition there is uncertainty regarding the

in preparing our financial statement and the uncertainty that could affect our result of operation financial condition and cash flow capitalization of labor and overhead cost valuation and impairment of franchise and goodwill income tax defined benefit pension planscapitalization of labor and overhead cost cost associated with network construction or upgrade placement of the customer drop to the dwelling and the placement of outlet within dwelling along with the cost associated with the deployment of new customer premise equipment necessary to provide internet video or voice service are capitalized cost capitalized include material direct labor and certain indirect cost these indirect cost are associated with the activity of personnel who assist in installation activity and consist of compensation and overhead cost associated with these support function while our capitalization is based on specific activity capitalized we track these cost on composite basis by fixed asset category at the cable system level and not on specific asset basis for asset that are sold or retired we remove the estimated applicable cost and accumulated depreciation the cost of disconnecting service and removing customer premise equipment from dwelling and the cost to reconnect customer drop or to redeploy previously installed customer premise equipment are charged to operating expense incurred cost for repair and maintenance are charged to operating expense incurred while plant and equipment replacement including replacement of certain component betterment and replacement of cable drop and outlet are capitalized we make judgment regarding the installation and construction activity to be capitalized we capitalized direct labor and overhead of billion for each of the year ended december and we capitalize direct labor and overhead using standard developed from actual cost and applicable operational data we calculate standard annually or more frequently if circumstance dictate for item such the labor rate overhead rate and the actual amount of time required to perform capitalizable activity for example the standard amount of time required to perform capitalizable activity are based on study of the time required to perform such activity overhead rate are established based on an analysis of the nature of cost incurred in support of capitalizable activity and determination of the portion of cost that is directly attributable to capitalizable activity the impact of change that resulted from these study were not material in the period presented labor cost directly associated with capital project are capitalized capitalizable activity performed in connection with installation include such activity dispatching truck roll to the customer dwelling or business for service connection or placement of new equipment cost to package and ship new equipment to customer home for self installation verification of serviceability to the customer dwelling or business determining whether the customer dwelling is capable of receiving service by our cable network customer premise activity performed by in house field technician and third party contractor in connection with the installation replacement and betterment of equipment and material to enable internet video or voice service and verifying the integrity of the customer network connection by initiating test signal downstream from the headend to the customer premise equipment well testing signal level at the utility pole or pedestal judgment is required to determine the extent to which overhead cost incurred result from specific capital activity and therefore should be capitalized the primary cost that are included in the determination of the overhead rate are employee benefit and payroll tax associated with capitalized direct labor ii direct variable cost associated with capitalizable activity iii the cost of support personnel such care personnel and dispatcher who assist with capitalizable installation activity and iv indirect cost directly attributable to capitalizable activity we believe our existing capitalization policy are appropriate significant change in the nature or extent of our operating practice could affect management judgment about the extent to which we should capitalize direct labor or overhead in the future we monitor the appropriateness of our capitalization policy and perform update to our internal study on an ongoing basis to determine whether fact or circumstance warrant change to our capitalization policy valuation and impairment of franchisesthe net carrying value of franchise of both december and wa approximately billion representing and of total asset respectively franchise asset are aggregated into essentially inseparable unit of accounting to conduct valuation the unit of accounting generally represent geographical clustering of our cable system into group for more information and complete discussion of how we value and test franchise asset for impairment see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statement contained in part ii item financial statement and supplementary data we perform an impairment assessment of franchise asset annually or more frequently warranted by event or change in circumstance we performed qualitative assessment in our assessment included consideration of multitude of factor that affect the fair value of our franchise asset example of such factor include environmental and competitive change within our operating footprint actual and projected operating performance the consistency of our operating margin equity and debt market trend including change in our market capitalization and change in our regulatory and political landscape among other factor based on our assessment we concluded that it wa more likely than not that the estimated fair value of our franchise asset equal or exceeds their carrying value and that quantitative impairment test is not required valuation and impairment of goodwillthe net carrying value of goodwill of both december and wa approximately billion representing of total asset we have determined that we have one reporting unit for purpose of the assessment of goodwill impairment for more information and complete discussion on how we test goodwill for impairment see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statement contained in part ii item financial statement and supplementary data we perform our impairment assessment of goodwill annually of november with our franchise impairment testing we elected to perform qualitative assessment of goodwill in given the completion of the assessment and absence of significant adverse change in factor impacting our fair value estimate we concluded that it is more likely than not that our goodwill is not impaired income tax of december charter had approximately billion of federal tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in gross deferred tax asset of approximately billion these loss resulted from the operation of charter holdco and it subsidiary and from loss carryforwards received result of the merger with twc federal tax net operating loss carryforwards expire in the year through in addition of december charter had state tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in gross deferred tax asset net of federal tax benefit of approximately million state tax net operating loss carryforwards generally expire in the year through such tax loss carryforwards can accumulate and be used to offset charter future taxable income after december million of charter federal tax loss carryforwards are subject to section and other restriction pursuant to these restriction charter estimate that approximately million annually over each of the next three year of federal tax loss carryforwards should become unrestricted and available for charter use charter state tax loss carryforwards are subject to similar but varying restriction in assessing the realizability of deferred tax asset management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will be realized in evaluating the need for valuation allowance management take into account various factor including the expected level of future taxable income available tax planning strategy and reversal of existing taxable temporary difference approximately million of valuation allowance associated with federal capital loss carryforwards and approximately million of valuation allowance associated with state tax loss carryforwards and other miscellaneous deferred tax asset remains on the december consolidated balance sheet in determining our tax provision for financial reporting purpose we establish reserve for uncertain tax position unless such position are determined to be more likely than not of being sustained upon examination based on their technical merit in evaluating whether tax position ha met the more likely than not recognition threshold we presume the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that ha full knowledge of all relevant information tax position that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in our financial statement the tax position is measured the largest amount of benefit that ha greater than likelihood of being when the position is ultimately resolved there is considerable judgment involved in determining whether position taken on the tax return are more likely than not of being sustained we adjust our uncertain tax reserve estimate periodically because of ongoing examination by and settlement with the various taxing authority well change in tax law regulation and interpretation no tax year for charter are currently under examination by the internal revenue service irs for income tax purpose charter through tax year remain open for examination and assessment charter short period return dated may prior to the merger with twc and acquisition of bright house and prior year remain open solely for purpose of examination of charter loss and credit

fourth quarter or earlier if remeasurement event occurs during an interim period we use december measurement date for our pension plan we recognized net periodic pension cost of million and million in and respectively net periodic pension benefit or expense is determined using certain assumption including the expected long term rate of return on plan asset discount rate and mortality assumption we determined the discount rate used to compute pension expense based on the yield of large population of high quality corporate bond with cash flow sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future defined benefit payment in developing the expected long term rate of return on asset we considered the current pension portfolio composition past average rate of earnings and our asset allocation target we used discount rate of to determine the december pension plan benefit obligation decrease in the discount rate of basis point would result in million increase in our pension plan benefit obligation of december and net periodic pension expense recognized in under our mark to market accounting policy the expected long term rate of return on plan asset used to determine net periodic pension benefit for the year ended december is expected to be decrease in the expected long term rate of return of basis point to while holding all other assumption constant would result in

lead to determination that it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset ha been impaired if after this optional qualitative assessment the company determines that it is not more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset ha been impaired then no further quantitative testing is necessary in completing the qualitative impairment testing the company evaluates

analysis for impairment testing if the company elect or is required to perform quantitative analysis to test it franchise asset for impairment the methodology described below is utilized if quantitative analysis is performed the estimated fair value of franchise is determined utilizing an income approach model based on the present value of the estimated discrete future cash flow attributable to each of the intangible asset identified assuming discount rate the fair value of franchise is determined based on estimated discrete discounted future cash flow using assumption consistent with internal forecast the franchise after tax cash flow is calculated the after tax cash flow generated by the potential customer obtained the sum of the present value of the franchise after tax cash flow in year through and the continuing value of the after tax cash flow beyond year yield the fair value of the franchise this approach make use of unobservable factor such projected

it carrying amount then no further quantitative testing would be necessary quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment result in more likely than not determination or if qualitative assessment is not performed the quantitative assessment considers whether the carrying amount of reporting unit exceeds it fair value in which case an impairment charge is recorded to the extent the reporting unit carrying value exceeds it fair value with the company franchise impairment testing in the company elected to perform qualitative goodwill communication inc and
