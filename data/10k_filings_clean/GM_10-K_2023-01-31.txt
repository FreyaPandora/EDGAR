require to control certain non ghg automotive emission including vehicle and engine exhaust emission standard vehicle evaporative emission standard and onboard diagnostic obd system requirement emission requirement have become more stringent result of stricter standard and new diagnostic requirement that have come into force in many market around the world often with very little harmonization regulatory authority may conduct ongoing evaluation of product from all manufacturer for additional information refer to item risk factor the federal government through the environmental protection agency epa imposes stringent exhaust and evaporative emission control requirement on vehicle sold in the the california air resource board carb likewise imposes stringent exhaust and evaporative emission standard the clean air act permit state that have area with air quality compliance issue to adopt california emission standard in lieu of federal requirement seventeen state have adopted california emission standard and there is possibility that additional jurisdiction could adopt california emission requirement in the future for each model year we must obtain certification that our vehicle and heavy duty engine will meet emission requirement of the epa we can sell vehicle in the and canada and of carb before we can sell vehicle in california and the state that have adopted california emission requirement the canadian federal government current vehicle pollutant emission requirement are generally aligned with federal requirement of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesin certain area within china began implementation of the china emission standard china requirement china combine element of both european union eu and standard and increase the time and mileage period over which manufacturer are responsible for vehicle emission performance nationwide implementation of china for new registration occurred in january and the more stringent china is expected to be implemented in july finally in china began study regarding the next generation of vehicle emission standard china which will likely be influenced by the european euro standard brazil ha approved set of national emission standard referred to implemented in and to be implemented from onward standard cover tailpipe exhaust gas durability for emission evaporative emission and noise limit and include additional obd requirement and phase in for onboard refueling vapor recovery system standard include target for vehicle emission and reduce corporate exhaust limit every two year until some of the requirement are aligned with those of the epa result of the sale of the opel and vauxhall business and certain other asset in europe the opel vauxhall business gm vehicle presence in europe is smaller but gm may still be affected by action taken by regulator related both to opel vauxhall vehicle sold before the sale of the opel vauxhall business well to other vehicle gm continues to sell in europe in the eu increased scrutiny of compliance with emission standard may result in change to these standard well stricter interpretation or redefinition of these standard and more

automotive fuel economy and ghg emission in the nhtsa promulgates and enforces corporate average fuel economy cafe standard for three separate fleet domestic car import car and light duty truck manufacturer may use one or combination of the following to resolve fleet deficit credit from the five prior model year expected credit for the next three model year credit obtained from other manufacturer and payment of civil penalty manufacturer that do not resolve deficit for model year may be subject to substantial civil penalty in addition to federal cafe standard the epa promulgates and enforces ghg emission standard nhtsa and the epa have separately finalized standard with differing stringency level and affected model year with the cafe standard addressing the model year and the ghg standard addressing the model year both the cafe and ghg standard have been challenged through litigation nhtsa and the epa also regulate the fuel efficiency and ghg emission of medium and heavy duty vehicle imposing more stringent standard over time in addition carb ha asserted the right to promulgate and enforce it state ghg standard for motor vehicle and other state have asserted the right to adopt carb standard carb regulation previously stated that compliance with the light duty epa ghg program is deemed compliance with carb standard however in december carb amended this regulation to state that in the event the epa were to alter federal ghg stringency which it now ha compliance with the epa ghg emission standard will no longer be deemed compliance with carb separate requirement while nhtsa and the epa previously took action to preempt california ghg standard nhtsa repealed it assertion of preemption and the epa rescinded it withdrawal of california preemption waiver enabling carb to enforce ghg standard from the advanced clean car acc program for the model year result gm is required to meet state ghg standard in california and state that have adopted california ghg standard the epa rescission of it withdrawal of california waiver ha been challenged through litigation carb ha also imposed requirement that increase percentage of zero emission vehicle zevs that must be sold in california while nhtsa and the epa previously took action to preempt california zev standard nhtsa repealed it assertion of preemption and the epa rescinded it withdrawal of california waiver enabling carb and adopting state to enforce zev standard from the acc program the epa rescission of it withdrawal of california waiver ha been challenged through litigation further in august carb finalized it advanced clean car ii acc ii program including zev standard requiring increasing percentage of zevs for the model year ending with sale target in the model year carb must obtain waiver from epa to implement it acc ii program additional jurisdiction could adopt carb acc and acc ii requirement in the future in canada federal light and heavy duty ghg regulation are currently patterned after the epa ghg emission standard given the integrated nature of the auto sector between canada and the united state the canadian light duty ghg standard continue to largely align with the ghg standard for the model year additionally the canadian federal government issued an emission reduction plan requiring the implementation of increasingly stringent zev sale requirement for the model year ending with sale target in the model year the canadian province of quebec ha zev requirement regulating the model year largely based on california program requirement and the province of

vehicle an individual vehicle pas fail type approval requirement and fleet average fuel consumption requirement with focus on the fleet average fuel consumption requirement the china phase launched in and full compliance is required by in addition china ha established mandate that requires passenger car manufacturer to produce certain volume of plug in hybrid battery electric and fuel cell vehicle which are referred to new energy vehicle nevs to generate credit in and beyond the number of credit per car is based on the level of electric range and energy efficiency with the goal of increasing nev volume penetration and improving technological sophistication over time uncommitted nev credit may be used to assist compliance with the fleet average fuel consumption requirement china ha issued nev credit target between and and is setting new nev credit target aimed at further increasing volume of nevs in and china ha provided various level of subsidy for nevs and certain subsidy were extended to the end of also in china began to study the fleet average fuel consumption requirement and nev credit mandate for phase these standard can potentially be more stringent aligned with the trend we are seeing in other key global market in brazil the secretary of industry and development promulgates and enforces cafe standard and ha enforced new cafe program for the period october september for light duty and mid size truck and suv including diesel vehicle the second and third phase of the program are yet to be finalized and are expected to gradually become more stringent for each period we have several option to comply with existing and potential new regulation that we have utilized and may continue to utilize including increasing production and sale of certain vehicle such ev and curtailing production of others which could include profitable ice vehicle technology change including fuel consumption efficiency and engine upgrade payment of penalty and or the purchase of credit from third party we regularly evaluate our current and future product plan and strategy for compliance with fuel economy and ghg regulation we plan to be carbon neutral by in our global product and operation supported by commitment to science based target in addition the company envisions an all electric future and plan to eliminate tailpipe emission from new light duty vehicle by these target align with our growth and transformation plan including our commitment to an all electric future which will be enabled by our ultium platform and hydrotec technology previously detailed

initial target of set in we are on target to meet the remaining need of our global operation with renewable energy by chemical regulation we continually monitor the implementation of chemical regulation to maintain compliance and evaluate their effect on our business supplier and the automotive industry globally government continue to introduce new legislation and regulation related to the selection and use of chemical by mandating broad prohibition or restriction and implementing vehicle interior air quality green chemistry life cycle analysis of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesand product stewardship initiative these initiative give broad regulatory authority to ban or restrict the use of certain chemical substance and potentially affect automobile manufacturer responsibility for vehicle component at the end of vehicle life well chemical selection for product development and manufacturing global treaty and initiative such the stockholm basel and rotterdam convention on chemical and waste the minamata convention on mercury and eu registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemical reach are driving chemical regulation across signatory country increase in the use of circuit board and other electronics may require additional assessment under the restriction on hazardous substance and waste from electrical and electronic equipment directive new european requirement require supplier of part and vehicle to the european market to disclose substance of concern in part chemical regulation are increasing in north america in the the epa is moving forward with risk analysis and management of high priority chemical under the authority of the lautenberg chemical safety for the century act in addition several state have chemical management regulation that can affect vehicle design and manufacturing such chemical restriction and use requirement for example maine will likely require the reporting of per and polyfluoroalkyl substance pfas in and the elimination of pfas in except for unavoidable us chemical restriction and export control in canada continue to steadily progress under the environment and climate change canada chemical management plan to ass existing substance and implement risk management control on any chemical deemed toxic these emerging law and regulation will potentially lead to increase in cost and supply chain complexity manufacturer including joint venture partner and supplier that do not comply with global and specific country regulation could be subject to civil penalty production disruption or limitation on the sale of affected product we believe we are materially in compliance with substantially all these requirement or expect to be materially in compliance by the required date vehicle safety requirement the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act of the safety act regulates the vehicle and item of motor vehicle equipment that we manufacture and sell the safety act prohibits the sale in the united state of any new vehicle or equipment that doe not conform to applicable federal motor vehicle safety standard established by nhtsa meeting or exceeding the many safety standard is costly global compliance and non governmental assessment requirement continue to evolve and grow more complex and lack harmonization globally the safety act further requires that if we or nhtsa determine vehicle or an item of vehicle equipment doe not comply with safety standard or that vehicle or equipment contains defect that pose an unreasonable safety risk we must conduct safety recall to remedy that condition in the affected vehicle we or nhtsa determine safety defect or noncompliance issue exists with respect to any of our vehicle the cost of such recall campaign could be substantial other national requirement outside of the many country have established vehicle safety standard and regulation and are likely to adopt additional more stringent requirement in the future the european general safety regulation ha introduced united nation economic commission for europe un ece regulation which are required for the european type approval process globally government generally have been adopting un ece based regulation with some variation to address local concern any difference between north american and un ece based regulation can add complexity and cost to vehicle development and we continue to support effort to harmonize regulation to reduce complexity new safety and recall requirement in various country around the world including in china brazil and gulf cooperation council country also may add substantial cost and complexity to our safety and field action activity globally in canada vehicle regulatory requirement are currently aligned with regulation however under the canadian motor vehicle safety act recall threshold are different and the minister of transport ha broad power to order manufacturer to submit notice of defect or non compliance when the minister considers it to be in the interest of safety further various government are beginning to mandate call and other feature that can be market specific and add complexity and increase our cost of compliance globally crash test rating and new car assessment program organization in various region around the world including in the rate and compare motor vehicle through various new car assessment program ncaps to provide consumer and business with additional information about the safety of new vehicle ncaps use crash test and other evaluation that are different than what is required by applicable regulation and use star or other grading system depending on the region to rate vehicle safety achieving high ncap rating which can vary by country and region can add

relative to our peer develop new software and service and leverage our scale manufacturing capability and synergy with existing ice vehicle in addition consumer adoption of ev will be critical to the success of our strategy consumer adoption of ev could be impacted by numerous factor including the breadth of the portfolio of ev available perception about ev feature quality safety performance and cost relative to ice vehicle the range over which ev may be driven on given battery charge the proliferation of charging infrastructure in particular with respect to public ev charging station and the success of the company charging infrastructure program and strategic joint venture and other relationship cost and availability of high fuel economy ice vehicle volatility or sustained decrease in the cost of petroleum based fuel failure by government and other third party to make the investment necessary to make infrastructure improvement such greater availability of cleaner energy grid and ev charging station and to provide economic incentive promoting the adoption of ev including those contemplated by the inflation reduction act and negative feedback from stakeholder impacting investor and consumer confidence in our company or industry if we are unable to successfully deliver on our ev strategy it could materially and adversely affect our result of operation financial condition and growth prospect and could negatively impact our brand and reputation our near term profitability is dependent upon the success of our current line of full size ice suv and full size ice pickup truck while we offer broad portfolio of car crossover suv and truck and we have announced significant plan to design build and sell broad portfolio of ev we currently recognize the highest profit margin on our full size ice suv and full size ice truck result our near term success is dependent upon our ability to sell higher margin vehicle in sufficient volume we are also using the cash generated by our ice vehicle to fund our growth strategy including with respect to ev and av any near term shift in consumer preference toward smaller more fuel efficient vehicle whether result of increase in the price of oil or any sustained shortage of oil including result of global political instability such related to russia invasion of ukraine concern about fuel consumption or ghg emission or other reason could weaken the demand for our higher margin vehicle more stringent fuel economy regulation could also impact our ability to sell these vehicle or could result in additional cost associated with these vehicle see our operation and product are subject to extensive law regulation and policy including those related to vehicle emission and fuel economy standard which can significantly increase our cost and affect how we do business we operate in highly competitive industry that ha historically had excess manufacturing capacity and attempt by our competitor to sell more vehicle could have significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing market share and operating result the global automotive industry is highly competitive in term of the quality innovation new technology pricing fuel economy reliability safety customer service and financial service offered additionally overall manufacturing capacity in the industry ha historically far exceeded demand in addition we have made and plan to continue to make significant investment in ev manufacturing capacity based on our expectation for ev demand which is subject to various risk and uncertainty described above many manufacturer including gm have relatively high fixed labor cost well limitation on their ability to efficiently close facility and reduce fixed cost often result of collective bargaining agreement in light of any excess capacity and high fixed cost many industry participant have attempted to sell more vehicle by providing subsidized financing or leasing program offering marketing incentive or reducing vehicle price result we have had and may in the future need to offer similar incentive which may result in vehicle price that do not offset our cost including any cost increase or the impact of adverse currency fluctuation which could affect our profitability our competitor may also seek to benefit from economy of scale by consolidating or entering into other strategic agreement such alliance or joint venture intended to enhance their competitiveness manufacturer in country that have lower production cost such china and india have become competitor in key emerging market and have announced their intention to export their product to established market low cost alternative to established entry level automobile in addition foreign government may decide to implement tax and other policy that favor their domestic manufacturer at the expense of international manufacturer including gm and it joint venture partner these action have had and are expected to continue to have significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing market share and operating result in these market of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesour av strategy is dependent upon our ability to successfully mitigate unique technological operational and regulatory risk gm cruise holding llc cruise holding our majority owned subsidiary is responsible for the development and commercialization of av technology our av operation are capital intensive and subject to variety of risk inherent with the development of new technology including our ability to continue to develop self driving software and hardware such light detection and ranging lidar sensor and other component access to sufficient capital risk related to the manufacture of purpose built av and significant competition from both established automotive company and technology company some of which may have more resource and capital to devote to av technology than we do in addition we face risk related to the commercial deployment of av on our targeted timeline or at all including consumer acceptance achievement of adequate safety and other performance standard and compliance with uncertain evolving and potentially conflicting federal state provincial or local regulation advanced technology such av present novel issue with which domestic and foreign regulator have only limited experience and will be subject to evolving regulatory framework any current or future regulation in these area could impede the successful commercialization of these technology and impact whether and how these technology are designed and integrated into our product and may ultimately subject to increased cost and uncertainty in order for cruise to successfully execute it business plan and achieve it revenue target legislation and regulation must evolve to permit widespread commercial av deployment to the extent accident cybersecurity breach or other adverse event associated with our autonomous driving system occur we could be subject to liability reputational harm government scrutiny and further regulation and it could deter consumer adoption of av technology any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our result of operation financial condition and growth prospect we are subject to risk associated with climate change including increased regulation of ghg emission changing consumer preference and other risk related to our transition to ev and the potential increased impact of severe weather event on our operation and infrastructure increasing attention to climate change increasing societal expectation on company to address climate change and change in consumer preference may result in increased cost reduced demand for our product reduced profit risk associated with new regulatory requirement risk to our reputation and the potential for increased litigation and governmental investigation climate change regulation at the federal state or local level or in international jurisdiction could require to further limit emission associated with customer use of product we sell change our manufacturing process or product portfolio or undertake other activity that may require to incur additional expense which may be material these requirement may increase the cost of and or diminish demand for our ice vehicle see our operation and product are subject to extensive law regulation and policy including those related to vehicle emission and fuel economy standard which can significantly increase our cost and affect how we do business in addition in the and abroad there are an increasing number of sustainability related rule and regulation that have been adopted or proposed such regulation may also subject to new disclosure requirement which could result in risk to our reputation or consumer demand for our product if we do not meet increasingly demanding stakeholder expectation and standard part of our strategy to address these risk includes our transition to ev which present additional risk including reduced demand for and therefore profit from our ice vehicle which we are using to fund our growth strategy higher cost or reduced availability of material related to ev technology impacting profitability particularly with respect to battery and battery raw material and risk related to the success of our ev strategy particularly with respect to advancement of battery cell technology charging infrastructure and competition see our long term strategy is dependent upon our ability to profitably deliver broad portfolio of ev and our near term profitability is dependent upon the success of our current line of full size ice suv and full size ice pickup truck finally increased intensity frequency or duration of storm drought or other severe weather event result of climate change may disrupt our production and the production logistics cost and procurement of product from our supplier and timely delivery of vehicle to customer and could negatively impact working condition at our plant and those of our supplier such weather event may also adversely impact the financial condition of our customer and thereby reduce demand for our product and service any of the foregoing could have material adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operation risk related to our operationsour business is highly dependent upon global automobile market sale volume which can be volatile because we have high proportion of relatively fixed structural cost small change in sale volume can have disproportionately large effect on our profitability number of economic and market condition drive change in new vehicle sale including disruption in the new vehicle supply chain the availability and price of used vehicle level of unemployment and inflation availability of affordable financing fluctuation in the cost of fuel consumer confidence and demand for vehicle political unrest or uncertainty the occurrence of public health crisis barrier to trade and other global economic condition for discussion of economic and market trend see the overview section in part ii item md if our operating environment deteriorates for these or other reason such moderate to severe recession it could lead to significant decrease in new vehicle sale which could materially and adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesinflationary pressure and persistently high price and uncertain availability of commodity raw material or other input used by and our supplier or instability in logistics and related cost could negatively impact our profitability increase in price including result of inflation and rising interest rate for commodity raw material or other input that we and our supplier use in manufacturing product system component and part such steel precious metal non ferrous metal critical mineral or other similar raw material or increase in logistics and related cost have led and may continue to lead to higher production cost for part component and vehicle in addition any increase in the cost or reduced availability of critical material for our ev propulsion system including lithium nickel cobalt and certain rare earth metal could lead to higher production cost for our ev and could impede our ability to successfully deliver on our ev strategy further increasing global demand for and uncertain supply of such material could disrupt our or our supplier ability to obtain such material in timely manner and or could lead to increased cost geopolitical risk fluctuation in supply and demand fluctuation in interest rate any weakening of the dollar and other economic and political factor have created and may continue to create pricing pressure for commodity raw material and other input these inflationary pressure could in turn negatively impact our profitability because we may not be able to pas all of those cost on to our customer or require our supplier to absorb such cost our business in china subject to unique operational competitive and regulatory risk our business in china is subject to aggressive competition from many of the largest global manufacturer and numerous domestic manufacturer well non traditional market participant such domestic technology company in addition our success in china depends upon our ability to adequately address unique market and consumer preference driven by advancement related to ev infotainment software enabled connected service and other new technology our ability to fully deploy our technology in china may be impacted by evolving law and regulation in the and china increased competition continued china trade tension or weakening economic condition in china among other factor may result in cost increase price reduction reduced sale profitability and margin and challenge to gaining or holding market share in addition the public health and policy response to covid in china may continue to present geopolitical macroeconomic and operating challenge certain risk and uncertainty of business in china are solely within the control of the chinese government and chinese law regulates the scope of our investment and business conducted within china the chinese government may adopt new regulation that may impact entity operating in china potentially with little advance notice in order to maintain access to the chinese market we may be required to comply with significant technical and other regulatory requirement including under such regulatory action that are unique to the chinese market at time with short notice these action may increase the cost of doing business in china or limit how we may do business in china which could materially and adversely affect the profitability and financial condition of our china business we benefit from many ongoing strategic business relationship and significant amount of our operation are conducted by joint venture which we can not operate solely for our benefit we are engaged in many strategic business relationship and we expect that such arrangement will continue to be an important factor in the growth and success of our business particularly in light of industry consolidation however there are no assurance that we will be able to identify or secure suitable business relationship in the future or that our competitor will not capitalize on such opportunity before we do or that any strategic business relationship that we enter into will be successful if we are unable to successfully source and execute on strategic business relationship in the future our overall growth could be impaired and our business prospect and result of operation could be materially adversely affected in particular to secure critical material for production of ev we have entered and plan to continue to enter into offtake agreement with raw material supplier and make investment in certain raw material supplier the term of these offtake agreement may obligate to purchase defined quantity of output over specified period of time subject to certain condition if we are unable to utilize or otherwise monetize the raw material we are obligated to purchase under these offtake agreement it could materially adversely affect our cash flow and increase our inventory in addition many of our operation primarily in china and korea well certain of our battery manufacturing operation in the and canada are carried out by joint venture in joint venture we share ownership and management of company with one or more party who may not have the goal strategy priority or resource we do and may compete with outside the joint venture joint venture are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co owner rather than for our exclusive benefit operating business joint venture often requires additional organizational formality well time consuming procedure for sharing information and making decision that must further take into consideration our partner interest in joint venture we are required to foster our relationship with our co owner well promote the overall success of the joint venture and if co owner change relationship deteriorate or strategic objective diverge our success in the joint venture may be materially adversely affected further some of the benefit from successful joint venture are shared among the co owner therefore we do not receive all the benefit from our successful joint venture in addition because we share ownership and management with one or more party we may have limited control over the action of joint venture particularly when we own minority interest result we may be unable to prevent violation of applicable law or other misconduct by joint venture or the failure to satisfy contractual obligation by one or more party moreover joint venture may not be subject to the same financial reporting corporate governance or compliance approach of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesthat we follow to the extent another party make decision that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control issue arise within the joint venture we may have to take responsive action or we may be subject to penalty fine or other punitive action for these activity the international scale and footprint of our operation expose to additional risk we manufacture sell and service product globally and rely upon an integrated global supply chain to deliver the raw material component system and part that we need to manufacture our product our global operation subject to extensive domestic and foreign legal and regulatory requirement and variety of other political economic and regulatory risk which may have material adverse effect on our financial condition or result of operation including change in government leadership change in trade compliance labor employment tax privacy environmental and other law regulation or government policy impacting our overall business model or practice or restricting our ability to manufacture purchase or sell product consistent with market demand and our business objective political pressure to change any aspect of our business model or practice or that impair our ability to source raw material service component system and part or manufacture product on competitive term in manner consistent with our business objective including with respect to full utilization of the incentive contemplated by the inflation reduction act political uncertainty instability civil unrest government control over certain sector including result of russia invasion of ukraine and related impact of the global supply of oil and other raw material or human right concern political and economic tension between government and change in international economic policy including restriction on the repatriation of dividend or in the export of technology especially between china and the change to custom requirement or procedure inspection

foreign corrupt practice act and certain other anti corruption law differing labor regulation agreement requirement and union relationship differing dealer and franchise regulation and relationship difficulty in obtaining financing in foreign country for local operation and natural disaster public health crisis including the occurrence of contagious disease or illness such covid and other catastrophic event any significant disruption at one of our manufacturing facility could disrupt our production schedule we assemble vehicle at various facility around the world our facility are typically designed to produce particular model for particular geographic market no single facility is designed to manufacture our full range of vehicle in some case certain facility produce product system component and part that disproportionately contribute greater degree to our profitability than others and create significant interdependency among manufacturing facility around the world when these or other facility become unavailable either temporarily or permanently for any number of reason including labor disruption supply chain disruption the occurrence of contagious disease or illness or catastrophic weather event whether or not result of climate change the inability to manufacture at the affected facility ha resulted and may in the future result in harm to our reputation increased cost lower revenue and the loss of customer we may not be able to easily shift production to other facility or to make up for lost production any new facility needed to replace an inoperable manufacturing facility would need to comply with the necessary regulatory requirement need to satisfy our specialized manufacturing requirement and require specialized equipment in addition substantially all of our hourly employee are represented by union and covered by collective bargaining agreement that must be negotiated from time to time including at the local facility level in our collective bargaining agreement with the uaw in the united state and unifor in canada well collective bargaining agreement in mexico will expire which will require negotiation of new agreement result we may be subject to an increased risk of strike work stoppage or other type of conflict with labor union and employee disruption in our supplier operation have disrupted and could in the future disrupt our production schedule our automotive operation are dependent upon the continued ability of our supplier to deliver the system component raw material and part that we need to manufacture our product our use of in time manufacturing process allows to maintain minimal inventory result our ability to maintain production is dependent upon our supplier delivering sufficient quantity of system component raw material and part on time to meet our production schedule in some instance we purchase system component raw material and part that are ultimately derived from single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruption any number of factor including labor disruption catastrophic weather event the occurrence of public health crisis such global pandemic contractual or other dispute unfavorable economic or industry condition delivery delay or other performance problem or financial difficulty or solvency problem could disrupt our of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariessuppliers operation and lead to uncertainty in our supply chain or cause supply disruption for which could in turn disrupt our operation including the production of certain higher margin vehicle if the covid pandemic continues to spread or reemerges and result in prolonged period of travel commercial social and other similar restriction we could experience continued and or additional global supply disruption when we experience supply disruption we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of system component raw material or part even for relatively short period of time could cause to alter production schedule increase work in process inventory or suspend production entirely which could cause loss of revenue or an increase in working capital which would adversely affect our profitability and financial condition in particular while the global semiconductor supply shortage is easing it ha had and is continuing to have wide ranging effect across multiple industry particularly the automotive industry and it ha impacted multiple supplier that incorporate semiconductor into the part they supply to result the semiconductor supply shortage ha had and depending on how long it persists could continue to have material impact on our operation pandemic epidemic disease outbreak and other public health crisis such the covid pandemic have disrupted our business and operation and future public health crisis could materially adversely impact our business financial condition liquidity and result of operation pandemic epidemic or disease outbreak in the or globally including the covid pandemic ha disrupted and may in the future disrupt our business which could materially affect our result of operation financial condition liquidity and future expectation any such event may adversely impact our global supply chain and global manufacturing operation and cause to suspend our operation in the china and elsewhere in particular we could experience among other thing continued or additional global supply disruption including delayed recovery from the global semiconductor supply shortage labor disruption an inability to manufacture an inability to sell to our customer decline in showroom traffic and customer demand during and following the pandemic customer default on automobile loan and lease lower than expected pricing on vehicle sold at auction and an impaired ability to access credit and the capital market any new pandemic or other public health crisis or future public health crisis could have material impact on our business financial condition and result of operation going forward risk related to our intellectual property cybersecurity information technology and data management practicescompetitors may independently develop product and service similar to and there are no guarantee that gm intellectual property right would prevent competitor from independently developing or selling those product and service there may be instance where notwithstanding our intellectual property position competitive product or service may impact the value of our brand and other intangible asset and our business may be adversely affected moreover although gm take reasonable step to maintain the confidentiality of gm proprietary information there can be no assurance that such effort will completely deter or prevent misappropriation or improper use of our intellectual property we sometimes face attempt to gain unauthorized access to our information technology network and system for the purpose of improperly acquiring our trade secret or confidential business information the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secret and other confidential business information result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position in addition we have been and in the future may be the target of patent enforcement action by third party including aggressive and opportunistic enforcement claim by non practicing entity regardless of the merit of such claim responding to infringement claim can be expensive and time consuming although we have taken step to mitigate such risk if we are found to have infringed any third party intellectual property right we could be required to pay substantial damage or we could be enjoined from offering some of our product and service in addition to prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property it may be necessary to prosecute action for infringement misappropriation or other violation of our intellectual property against third party any such action could result in significant cost and diversion of our resource and management attention and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any such action security breach and other disruption to information technology system and networked product including connected vehicle owned or maintained by gm financial or third party such vendor or supplier could interfere with our operation and could compromise the confidentiality of private customer data or our proprietary information we rely upon information technology system and manufacture networked and connected product some of which are managed by third party to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support variety of our business process activity and product additionally we and gm financial collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property and proprietary business information including that of our dealer and supplier well personally identifiable information of our customer and employee in data center and on information technology network including network that may be controlled or maintained by third party the secure operation of these system and product and the processing and maintenance of the information processed by these system and product is critical to our business operation and strategy further customer using our system rely on the security of our infrastructure including hardware and other element provided by third party to ensure the reliability of our

in addition such event could increase the risk of claim alleging that we are non compliant with applicable law or regulation subjecting to potential liability or regulatory penalty and related cost under law protecting the privacy of personal information disrupt our operation or reduce the competitive advantage we hope to derive from our investment in advanced technology various event described above have occurred in the past and may occur in the future although impact of past event have been immaterial the impact of such event in the future may be material security breach and other disruption of our in vehicle system could impact the safety of our customer and reduce confidence in gm and our product our vehicle contain complex information technology system these system control various vehicle function including engine transmission safety steering navigation acceleration braking window door lock function and battery and electric motor we have designed implemented and tested security measure intended to prevent unauthorized access to these system however hacker have reportedly attempted and may attempt in the future to gain unauthorized access to modify alter and use such system to gain control of or to change our vehicle functionality user interface and performance characteristic or to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle any unauthorized access to or control of our vehicle or their system could adversely impact the safety of our customer or result in legal claim or proceeding liability or regulatory penalty law that would permit third party access to vehicle data and related system could expose our vehicle and vehicle system to third party access without appropriate security measure in place leading to new safety and security risk for our customer and reducing customer trust and confidence in our product in addition regardless of their veracity report of unauthorized access to our vehicle or their system could negatively affect our brand and harm our reputation which could adversely impact our business and operating result our enterprise data practice including the collection use sharing and security of the personal identifiable information of our customer employee and supplier are subject to increasingly complex and restrictive regulation in all key market region under these regulation the failure to maintain compliant data practice could result in consumer complaint and regulatory inquiry resulting in civil or criminal penalty well brand impact or other harm to our business in addition increased consumer sensitivity to real or perceived failure in maintaining acceptable data practice could damage our reputation and deter current and potential user or customer from using our product and service the cost of compliance with these law and regulation will be high and is likely to increase in the future the growing patchwork of state and country regulation imposes burdensome obligation on company to quickly respond to consumer request such request to delete disclose and stop selling personal information with significant fine for noncompliance complying with these new law ha significantly increased and may continue to increase our operating cost and is driving increased complexity in our operation risk related to government regulation and litigationour operation and product are subject to extensive law regulation and policy including those related to vehicle emission and fuel economy standard which can significantly increase our cost and affect how we do business we are significantly affected by governmental regulation on global basis that can increase cost related to the production of our vehicle and affect our product portfolio particularly regulation relating to fuel economy standard and ghg emission meeting or exceeding the requirement of these regulation is costly often technologically challenging and may require phase out of internal combustion propulsion in certain major jurisdiction and these standard are often not harmonized across jurisdiction we anticipate that the number and extent of these and other regulation law and policy and the related cost and change to our product portfolio may increase significantly in the future primarily motivated by effort to reduce ghg emission specifically fuel economy and ghg emission regulation at the federal state or local level or in international jurisdiction could require to further limit the sale of certain profitable product subsidize the sale of le profitable one change our manufacturing process pay penalty or undertake other activity that may require to incur additional expense which may be material these requirement may increase the cost of and or diminish demand for our vehicle these regulatory requirement among others could significantly affect our plan for global product development and given the uncertainty surrounding enforcement and regulatory definition and interpretation may result in substantial cost including civil or criminal penalty in addition an evolving but un harmonized emission and fuel economy regulatory framework that could include specific sale mandate may limit or dictate the type of vehicle we sell and where we sell them which can of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesaffect our revenue refer to the environmental and regulatory matter section of item business for further information on regulatory and environmental requirement we expect that to comply with fuel economy and ghg emission standard and mandate to sell specific volume of zev in certain jurisdiction we will be required to sell significant volume of ev and potentially develop and implement new technology for conventional internal combustion engine all of which will require substantial investment and expense there are limit on our ability to achieve fuel economy improvement over given time frame primarily relating to the cost and effectiveness of available technology lack of sufficient consumer acceptance of new technology and of change in vehicle mix lack of willingness of consumer to absorb the additional cost of new technology the appropriateness or lack thereof of certain technology for use in particular vehicle the widespread availability or lack thereof of supporting infrastructure for new technology especially for ev and the human engineering and financial resource necessary to deploy new technology across wide range of product and powertrains in short time there is no assurance that we will be able to produce and sell vehicle that use such new technology on profitable basis or that our customer will purchase such vehicle in the quantity necessary for to comply with current or future regulatory requirement in the current uncertain regulatory framework compliance cost for which we may be responsible and that are not reasonably estimable could be substantial alleged violation of fuel economy or emission standard could result in legal proceeding the recall of one or more of our product negotiated remedial action fine restricted product offering or combination of any of those item any of these action could have material adverse effect on our profitability financial condition and operation including facility idling reduced employment increased cost and loss of revenue in addition many of our advanced technology including av present novel issue with which domestic and foreign regulator have only limited experience and will be subject to evolving regulatory framework any current or future regulation in these area could impede the successful commercialization of these technology and impact whether and how these technology are designed and integrated into our product and may ultimately subject to increased cost and uncertainty we could be materially adversely affected by unusual or significant litigation governmental investigation or other proceeding we are subject to legal proceeding in the and elsewhere involving various issue including product liability lawsuit warranty litigation class action litigation alleging product defect emission litigation stockholder litigation labor and employment litigation and claim and action arising from restructurings and divestiture of operation and asset in addition we are subject to governmental proceeding and investigation negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceeding could result in the imposition of damage including punitive damage fine reputational harm civil lawsuit and criminal penalty interruption of business modification of business practice equitable remedy and other sanction against or our personnel well legal and other cost all of which may be significant for further discussion of these matter refer to note to our consolidated financial statement the cost and effect on our reputation of product safety recall and alleged defect in product and service could materially adversely affect our business government safety standard require manufacturer to remedy certain product safety defect through recall campaign and vehicle repurchase under these standard we could be subject to civil or criminal penalty or may incur various cost including significant cost for repair made at no cost to the consumer the cost we incur in connection with these recall typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part the cost to complete recall could be exacerbated to the extent that such action relates to global platform concern about the safety of our product including advanced technology like av whether raised internally or by regulator or consumer advocate and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data can result in product delay recall field action lost sale governmental investigation regulatory action private claim lawsuit and settlement and reputational damage these circumstance can also result in damage to brand image brand equity and consumer trust in our product and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry we currently source variety of system component raw material and part from third party from time to time these item may have performance or quality issue that could harm our reputation and cause to incur significant cost particularly if the affected item relate to global platform or involve defect that are identified year after production our ability to recover cost associated with recall or other campaign caused by part or component purchased from supplier may be limited by the supplier financial condition or number of other reason or defense we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure we are subject to the tax law and regulation of the and numerous other jurisdiction in which we do business many judgment are required in determining our worldwide provision for income tax and other tax liability and we are regularly under audit by the internal revenue service and other tax authority which may not agree with our tax position in addition our tax liability are subject to other significant risk and uncertainty

in the valuation of our deferred tax asset and liability any unfavorable resolution of these and other uncertainty may have significant adverse impact on our tax rate and result of operation if our tax expense were to increase or if the ultimate determination of our tax owed is for an amount in excess of amount previously accrued our operating result cash flow and financial condition could be adversely affected risk related to automotive financing gm financial we rely on gm financial to provide financial service to our customer and dealer gm financial face number of business economic and financial risk that could impair it access to capital and negatively affect it business and operation which in turn could impede it ability to provide leasing and financing to customer and commercial lending to our dealer any reduction in gm financial ability to provide such financial service would negatively affect our effort to support additional sale of our vehicle and expand our market penetration among customer and dealer the primary factor that could adversely affect gm financial business and operation and reduce it ability to provide financing service at competitive rate include the sufficiency availability and cost of source of financing including credit facility securitization program and secured and unsecured debt issuance the performance of loan and lease in it portfolio which could be materially affected by charge offs delinquency and prepayment wholesale auction value of used vehicle vehicle return rate and the residual value performance on vehicle gm financial

established using historical information on the nature frequency and average cost of claim of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumption about future activity and event when little or no claim experience exists for model year or vehicle line the estimate is based on comparable model we accrue the cost related to product warranty at the time of vehicle sale and we accrue the estimated cost of recall campaign when they are probable and estimable the estimate related to recall campaign accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying paid loss approach that considers the number of historical recall campaign and the estimated cost for each recall campaign these estimate consider the nature frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaign and use key assumption including the number of historical period and the weighting of historical data in the reserve study cost associated with recall campaign not accrued at the time of

courtesy transportation at no cost to our customer these estimate are re evaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information revision are made when necessary based on change in these factor the estimated amount accrued for recall campaign at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall event the number of vehicle per recall event the assumed number of vehicle that will be brought in by customer for repair take rate and the cost per vehicle for each recall event the estimated cost of recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaign would increase the estimated cost by approximately billion actual experience could differ from the amount estimated requiring adjustment to these liability in future period due to the uncertainty and potential

sale volume product mix and the rate of customer acceptance of incentive program all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumption concerning future customer behavior and market condition change in any of these factor affecting the estimate could have significant effect on recorded sale incentive increase in the cost of incentive would increase the sale incentive liability by

operating lease each leased asset in the portfolio represents vehicle that gm financial owns and ha leased to customer at lease inception an estimate is made of the expected residual value for the vehicle at the end of the lease term which typically range from two to five year gm financial estimate the expected residual value based on third party data that considers various data point and assumption including but not limited to recent auction value the expected future volume of returning leased vehicle significant liquidation of rental or fleet inventory used vehicle price manufacturer incentive program and fuel price during the term of lease gm financial periodically evaluates the estimated residual value and may adjust the value downward which increase the prospective depreciation or upward limited to the contractual residual value which decrease the prospective depreciation the customer is obligated to make payment during the lease term for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus money factor however since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract gm financial is exposed to risk of loss to the extent the customer return the vehicle prior to or at the end of the lease term and the proceeds gm financial receives on the disposition of the vehicle are lower than the residual value estimated at

wa completed for the pension plan result of change to our capital market assumption the weighted average long term rate of return on asset increased from at december to at december the expected long term rate of return on plan asset used in determining pension expense for non plan is determined in similar manner to the plan another key assumption in determining net pension and opeb expense is the assumed discount rate used to discount plan obligation we estimate the assumed discount rate for plan using cash flow matching approach which us projected cash flow matched to spot rate along high quality corporate bond yield curve to determine the weighted average discount rate for the calculation of the present value of cash flow we apply the individual annual yield curve rate instead of the

the following analysis provide quantitative information regarding exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure the potential loss in the fair value of financial instrument with exposure to market risk the model used assume instantaneous parallel shift in exchange rate and interest rate yield curve for option and other instrument with nonlinear return model appropriate to these type of instrument are utilized to determine the effect of market shift there are certain shortcoming inherent in the sensitivity analysis presented primarily due to the assumption that interest rate change in parallel fashion and that spot exchange rate change instantaneously in addition the analysis are unable to reflect the complex market reaction that normally would arise from the market shift modeled and do not contemplate the effect of correlation between foreign currency exposure and offsetting long short position in currency or other exposure such interest rate which may significantly reduce the potential loss in value foreign currency exchange rate risk we have foreign currency exposure related to buying selling and financing in currency other than the functional currency of our operation at december our most significant foreign currency exposure were between the dollar and the canadian dollar chinese yuan korean

debt and exclude the offsetting effect of foreign currency cash cash equivalent and other asset the potential loss in fair value for such financial instrument from adverse change in all quoted foreign currency exchange rate would have been insignificant at december and we are exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the result of certain international operation into dollar part of the consolidation process we had foreign currency derivative with notional amount of billion and billion at december and the fair value of these derivative financial instrument wa

debt is subject to adjustment to reflect prevailing market interest rate to help mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding gm financial may employ hedging quantitative disclosure gm financial measure the sensitivity of it net interest income to change in interest rate by using interest rate scenario that assume hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift of one hundred basis point in all interest rate across all maturity well base case that assumes that rate perform at the current market forward curve however interest rate change are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rate could move more or le than the one percentage point assumed in our analysis therefore the actual impact to net interest income could be higher or lower than the result detailed in the table below these interest rate scenario are purely hypothetical and do not represent our view of future interest rate movement at december and gm financial wa liability sensitive meaning that more liability than asset were expected to re price within the next month during period of rising interest rate the interest paid on liability would increase more than the interest earned on asset which would initially decrease net interest income during period of falling interest rate net interest income would be expected to initially increase gm financial hedging strategy approved by it global asset liability

assumption including the amortization and prepayment of the finance receivable portfolio origination of finance receivables and lease refinancing of maturing debt replacement of maturing derivative and exercise of option embedded in debt and derivative the prepayment projection are based on historical experience if interest rate or other factor change actual prepayment experience could be different than projected foreign currency exchange rate risk gm financial is exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the result of certain international operation into dollar part of the consolidation process fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate can therefore create volatility in the result of operation and may adversely affect gm financial financial condition gm financial primarily finance it receivables and leased asset with debt in the same currency when different currency is used gm financial may use foreign currency swap to convert substantially all of it foreign currency debt obligation to the local currency of the receivables and leased asset to minimize any impact to earnings result gm financial belief it market risk exposure

nhtsa directed that we replace the takata corporation takata airbag inflator in our vehicle which are full size pickup truck and suv and we decided not to contest nhtsa decision while we have already begun the process of executing the recall given the number of vehicle in this population the recall will take several year to be completed accordingly in the year ended december we recorded warranty accrual of billion for the expected cost of complying with the recall remedy and we believe the currently accrued amount remains reasonable gm ha recalled certain vehicle sold outside of the to replace takata inflator in those vehicle there are significant difference in vehicle and inflator design between the relevant vehicle sold internationally and those sold in the we continue to gather and analyze evidence about these inflator and to share our finding with regulator any additional recall relating to these inflator could be material to our result of operation and cash flow there are several putative class action that have been filed against gm including in the federal court in the in the provincial court in canada and in mexico arising out of allegation that airbag inflator manufactured by takata are defective at this stage of these proceeding we are unable to provide an estimate of the amount or range of reasonably possible material loss chevrolet bolt recall in july we initiated voluntary recall for certain model year chevrolet bolt ev due to the risk that two manufacturing defect present in the same battery cell could cause high voltage battery fire in certain of these vehicle accordingly in the three month ended june we recorded warranty accrual of million after further investigation into the manufacturing process at our battery supplier lg and disassembling battery pack we determined that the risk of battery cell defect wa not confined to the initial recall population result in august we expanded the recall to include all model year chevrolet bolt ev and chevrolet bolt electric utility vehicle euvs and recorded an additional warranty accrual of billion in the three month ended september in october we reached an agreement with lg under which lg will reimburse gm for cost and expense associated with the recall result in the three month ended september we recognized receivable of billion which substantially offset the warranty charge we recognized in connection with the recall these charge reflect our current best estimate for the cost of the recall remedy the actual cost of the recall and gm associated recovery from lg could be materially higher or lower for model year vehicle the recall remedy will be to replace the high voltage battery module in these vehicle with new module for model year vehicle the recall remedy will be to replace any defective high voltage battery module in these vehicle with new module in addition putative class action have been filed against gm in federal court in the and in the provincial court in canada

covenant included in the agreement and for certain other liability including cost related to certain emission claim product liability and recall the company entered into guarantee for the benefit of
