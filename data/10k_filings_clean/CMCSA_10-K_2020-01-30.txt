update any forward looking statement comcast annual report on form table of contentsitem risk factorsour business operate in highly competitive and dynamic industry and our business and result of operation could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively all of our business operate in intensely competitive consumer driven and rapidly changing environment and compete with growing number of company that provide broad range of communication product and service and entertainment news and information content to consumer ott service provider continue to proliferate complicating the competitive landscape by influencing consumer behavior and challenging existing business model which is discussed in more detail in the risk factor immediately below for example competition for cable communication video high speed internet and voice service consists primarily of phone company with fiber based network and db provider that typically offer feature pricing and packaging for service comparable to ours sky face competition for it video high speed internet and voice service from cable and telecommunication provider in it european market many of which offer customer bundled service which ha increased competition increasingly additional company some with significant financial resource or fewer regulatory burden have entered or are seeking to enter the video distribution market by offering ott streaming service or selling device that aggregate viewing of various ott service many ott service provider offer smaller package of channel or subscription to access programming at price point lower than our standard package or for free which adversely affect demand for cable communication and sky traditional dth video service including for expanded video package premium network and dvr and on demand service cable communication and sky high speed internet service compete primarily against phone company with fiber based network offering speed and pricing comparable to ours wireless internet service such and wireless broadband service satellite delivered internet service and wi fi network and device such smartphones tablet wireless data card and mobile and fixed wireless router that connect to such service also may compete with our high speed internet service particularly wireless technology evolves some municipality in the united state own and operate their own broadband network and additional municipality may do so in the future nbcuniversal and sky face substantial and increasing competition from provider of similar type of content well from other form of entertainment and recreational activity nbcuniversal and sky must compete to obtain talent content and other resource required to operate their business this competition ha intensified ott service provider seek to develop high quality programming to attract viewer for more detailed description of the competition facing our business see item business and refer to the competition discussion within that section consolidation of or cooperation between our competitor including supplier and distributor of content may increase competition in all of these area for example consolidation or cooperation between phone company which are also wireless distributor and content provider may allow competitor to offer free or lower cost streaming service potentially on an exclusive basis through unlimited data usage plan for internet or wireless phone service the ability of our business to compete effectively also depends on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituency including our customer consumer advertiser employee investor and government authority our ability to compete will be negatively affected if we do not provide our customer with satisfactory customer experience while we continue to seek way to enhance the value of our business such by growing high speed internet service and business service and by investing in new theme park and peacock there can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiative in manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or operating margin or to compete successfully in the future there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against existing or new competitor or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our business change in consumer behavior driven by online video distribution platform for viewing content continue to adversely affect our business and challenge existing business model distribution platform for viewing and purchasing content over the internet have been and will likely continue to be developed that further increase the number of competitor that all our business face and challenge existing business model these distribution platform have driven and will continue to drive change in consumer behavior consumer seek more control over when where and how they consume content and access communication service and how much they pay for such content annual report on form ktable of contentsconsumers are increasingly turning to online source for viewing and purchasing content which is reducing the number of cable communication video customer and subscriber to nbcuniversal cable network even it make cable communication high speed internet service more important to consumer these changing consumer behavior also are occurring in europe more of sky new video customer have recently subscribed and may continue to subscribe to sky ott video service instead of it traditional dth video service although we have attempted to adapt our video service offering and enhance our high speed internet service for changing consumer behavior for example by deploying the and sky platform and flex which can more easily aggregate linear and ott programming choice for our customer the continuing trend of ott service provider delivering their content directly to consumer over the internet rather than through or in addition to traditional video distribution service continues to disrupt traditional video distribution business model the increase in ott service provider also ha significantly increased the number of entertainment choice available to consumer which ha intensified audience fragmentation and disaggregated the way that content traditionally ha been distributed and viewed by consumer time shifting technology such dvr and on demand service also reduce the viewing of content through traditional and virtual multichannel video provider which ha caused and likely will continue to cause audience rating decline for our programming channel reduced rating may adversely affect the price and amount of advertising that advertiser are willing to purchase from and the amount that we receive for distribution of our content in addition more programming provider offer their content directly to consumer they may reduce the quantity and quality of the programming they license to nbcuniversal or sky programming channel our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitor or change in consumer behavior including among younger consumer and shifting business model could have an adverse effect on our competitive position business and result of operation decline in advertiser expenditure or change in advertising market could negatively impact our business cable communication nbcuniversal and sky compete for the sale of advertising time with other television network and station well with all other advertising platform such digital medium radio and print we derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising and decline in expenditure by advertiser including through traditional linear television distribution model could negatively impact our result of operation decline can be caused by the economic prospect of specific advertiser or industry increased competition for the leisure time of viewer such from social medium and video game audience fragmentation increased viewing of content through ott service provider regulatory intervention regarding where and when advertising may be placed or economic condition generally in addition advertiser have increasingly shifted their expenditure to digital medium and their willingness to purchase advertising from may be adversely affected by lower audience rating which many of nbcuniversal network and some of sky television channel have experienced and likely will continue to experience advertising sale and rate also are dependent on the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodology do not accurately reflect actual viewership level for example certain method of viewing content such through ott service or delayed viewing through dvr or on demand service might not be counted in audience measurement or may generate le if any revenue than traditional linear television distribution method which could have an adverse effect on our advertising revenue our business depend on keeping pace with technological development our success is to large extent dependent on our ability to acquire develop adopt and leverage new and existing technology and our competitor use of certain type of technology and equipment may provide them with competitive advantage for example current and new wireless internet technology such and wireless broadband service continue to evolve rapidly to allow for greater speed and reliability and some company and municipality are building advanced fiber based network that provide very fast internet access speed we expect other advance in communication technology to occur in the future if we choose technology or equipment that is not effective or attractive to consumer that employed by our competitor if we fail to employ technology desired by consumer before our competitor do so or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiative our business and result of operation could be adversely affected we also will continue to incur additional cost we execute our technology initiative such the deployment of flex and sky set top box and wireless gateway there can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiative in manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or to compete successfully in the future we also may generate le revenue or incur increased cost if change in our competitor product offering require that we offer certain service or enhancement at lower or no cost to our customer or that we increase our research and development expenditure comcast annual report on form table of contentswe are subject to regulation by federal state local and foreign authority which impose additional cost and restriction on our business in the united state federal state and local government extensively regulate the high speed internet video and voice service industry our broadcast television business is also highly regulated by law and regulation nbcuniversal other business are also subject to various other law and regulation at the international federal state and local level sky business is subject to various telecommunication and medium specific regulation where it operates the fcc ftc and certain state attorney general and foreign governmental authority also have been active in conducting inquiry and review regarding our service and this trend likely will continue in addition regulator and the court could adopt new interpretation of existing competition law new competition law theory emerge failure to comply with the law and regulation applicable to our business could result in administrative enforcement action fine and civil and criminal liability legislator and regulator at all level of government including foreign authority frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing statute rule or regulation or interpretation of existing statue rule or regulation or prescribe new one any of which may address communication and other issue that could significantly affect our business these legislator and regulator have been active in considering legislation and rulemakings regarding our service at time looking to adopt regulatory approach from different country that may be more burdensome for example some state have passed or introduced legislation or executive order that impose various open internet and data privacy requirement such attempt by the state to regulate portion of our business have the potential to create patchwork of differing and or conflicting state regulation these requirement and any future legislative judicial regulatory or administrative action may increase our cost or impose additional restriction on our business some of which may be significant we are unable to predict the outcome or effect of any of these potential action or any other legislative or regulatory proposal on our business any change to the legal and regulatory framework applicable to any of our service or business could have an adverse impact on our business and result of operation for more extensive discussion of the significant risk associated with the regulation of our business see item business and refer to the legislation and regulation discussion within that section programming expense for our video service are increasing which could adversely affect cable communication and sky video business we expect programming expense for our video service to continue to be the largest single expense item for our cable communication and sky segment and to increase for the foreseeable future our programming expense may also increase we add programming to our video service or distribute existing programming to more of our customer or through additional delivery platform such on demand or streaming service additionally cable communication pay certain local broadcast television station in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to video service customer we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demand for payment and other concession from local broadcast television station these market factor may be exacerbated by increased consolidation in the medium industry which may further increase our programming expense if we are unable to raise our customer rate or offset programming cost increase through the sale of additional service or cost management initiative the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our cable communication and sky segment result of operation moreover our contract with content provider expire there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable term if renewed at all in which case we may be unable to provide such content part of cable communication or sky video service and our business and result of operation could be adversely affected nbcuniversal and sky success depends on consumer acceptance of their content and their business may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the cost to create or acquire content increase nbcuniversal and sky create and acquire medium and entertainment content the success of which depends substantially on consumer taste and preference that change in often unpredictable way the success of these business depends on our ability to consistently create acquire market and distribute television programming filmed entertainment theme park attraction and other content that meet the changing preference of the broad domestic and international consumer market we have invested and will continue to invest substantial amount in our content including in the production of original content at nbcuniversal and sky in our film and for new theme park and theme park attraction before learning the extent to which they will earn consumer acceptance we also are incurring significant cost to develop peacock and there can be no assurance that consumer and advertiser will embrace this offering nbcuniversal and sky also obtain significant portion of their content from third party such movie studio television production company sport organization and other supplier sometimes on an exclusive basis competition for popular content particularly for sport programming is intense and we may have to increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitor for popular content we also may be unable to license popular third party content for nbcuniversal and sky annual report on form ktable of contentsprogramming channel if medium company launch successful ott service for their owned content such that they forgo license fee from and only provide their content directly to consumer entering into or renewing contract for such programming right or acquiring additional right may result in significantly increased cost particularly with respect to long term contract for sport programming right for nbcuniversal and sky our result of operation and cash flow over the term of contract depend on number of factor including the strength of the advertising market audience size the timing and amount of right payment and the ability of nbcuniversal to secure distribution from impose surcharge on or obtain carriage on multichannel video provider there can be no assurance that revenue from these contract will exceed our cost for the right well the other cost of producing and distributing the programming if our content doe not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or if we can not obtain or retain right to popular content on acceptable term or at all nbcuniversal and sky business may be adversely affected the loss of programming distribution and licensing agreement or the renewal of these agreement on le favorable term could adversely affect our business nbcuniversal cable network depend on their ability to secure and maintain distribution agreement with traditional and virtual multichannel video provider the number of subscriber to nbcuniversal cable network ha been and likely will continue to be reduced result of fewer subscriber to multichannel video provider sky also depends on it ability to secure and maintain wholesale distribution agreement for it television channel with multichannel video provider increasingly nbcuniversal and sky are entering into agreement to license their prior season and library content on other distribution platform including ott service if this programming doe not attract sufficient viewer traditional and virtual multichannel video provider may not distribute nbcuniversal or sky programming and ott service may not license programming nbcuniversal or sky creates in addition we expect not to license certain popular content and we may decide not to license additional popular content that we own to third party so we may offer it exclusively through peacock which would result in foregone licensing revenue nbcuniversal broadcast television network depend on their ability to secure and maintain network affiliation agreement with third party local broadcast television station in the market where it doe not own the affiliated local broadcast television station in addition every three year each of it owned local broadcast television station must elect with respect to it retransmission by multichannel video provider within it dma either must carry status in which the distributor carriage of the station is mandatory and doe not generate any compensation for the local station or retransmission consent in which the station give up it right to mandatory carriage and instead seek to negotiate the term and condition of carriage with the distributor including the amount of compensation if any paid to the station by such distributor for the current three year period which commenced on january all of our owned nbc broadcast television station and our owned telemundo broadcast television station elected retransmission consent however certain illegal online entity may stream our broadcast television content online without our consent and without paying any compensation to there can be no assurance that any of these agreement will be entered into or renewed in the future on acceptable term the inability to enter into or renew these agreement could reduce our revenue and the reach of our programming which could adversely affect nbcuniversal and sky business le favorable telecommunication access regulation the loss of sky transmission agreement with satellite or telecommunication provider or the renewal of these agreement on le favorable term could adversely affect sky business sky relies on various third party telecommunication provider to deliver it video high speed internet voice and wireless phone service to it customer for example sky relies on satellite leased from third party to provide most of it video service in addition pursuant to the current regulatory regime in the and italy sky is able to access network owned by third party telecommunication provider to offer it high speed internet and phone service in most case on regulated term including price if there is change in regulation in the italy or other market where sky access network owned by third party telecommunication provider the regulated term could become le favorable moreover while sky is able to receive wholesale fiber access on fair reasonable and non discriminatory term pricing term are not regulated result if sky is unable to enter into or renew it transmission agreement with satellite or telecommunication operator on commercially reasonable term or if these operator were to terminate their agreement sky may be unable to deliver some of it service to customer in one or more of the country in which it operates which would adversely affect sky

expenditure to repair or replace the damaged property product service network or information system to protect them from similar event in the future and any such event could lead to litigation or otherwise have an adverse effect on our result of operation in addition we obtain certain confidential proprietary and personal information about our customer personnel and vendor and in some case provide this information to third party in connection with our business while we generally obtain assurance that these third party will protect this information there is risk that this information may be compromised any security breach such misappropriation misuse leakage falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our third party information technology system including customer personnel and vendor data could damage our reputation and require to expend significant capital and other resource to remedy any such security breach could lead to litigation or could cause regulator to impose fine or other remedy for failure to comply with relevant customer privacy rule the risk of system related event and security breach occurring continues to intensify in many of our business and our business may be at disproportionately heightened risk of these event occurring due to the nature of our business and because we maintain certain information necessary to conduct our business in digital form in the ordinary course of our business there are frequent attempt by third party to cause such system related event and security breach and to identify our security architecture or system design vulnerability while we develop and maintain system and operate an extensive security program seeking to prevent system related event and security breach from occurring the development maintenance and operation of these system and program is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating technology change and effort to overcome security measure become more sophisticated and evolve rapidly despite our effort to prevent these event and security breach we have experienced system related event and breach in the past and there can be no assurance that they will not occur in the future or will not have an adverse effect on our business moreover the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against loss resulting from any such event or security breach likely would not be sufficient to cover our loss or otherwise adequately compensate for any disruption to our business that may result and the occurrence of any such event or security breach could

any of these event occur which may limit our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on our result of operation even if we believe any such challenge or claim are without merit they can be time consuming and costly to defend and divert management attention and resource away from our business moreover if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain license from our vendor and other third party on reasonable term our business could be adversely affected in addition intellectual property constitutes significant part of the value of nbcuniversal and sky business and their success is highly dependent on protecting the intellectual property right of the content they create or acquire against third party misappropriation reproduction or infringement the unauthorized reproduction distribution or display of copyrighted material negatively affect our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content well from the sale of advertising in connection with our content and increase our cost due to our active enforcement of our intellectual property right piracy and other unauthorized us of content are made easier and the enforcement of intellectual property right more challenging by technological advance that allow the conversion of programming film and other content into digital format which facilitates annual report on form ktable of

for nbcuniversal cable network broadcast television and filmed entertainment business it also present similar challenge for sky business including result of illegal retransmission of sport event while piracy is challenge in the united state it is particularly prevalent in many part of the world that lack developed copyright law effective enforcement of copyright law and technical protective measure like those in effect in the united state if any or international law intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property right are repealed or weakened or are not adequately enforced or if the legal system fails to adapt to new technology that facilitate piracy we may be unable to effectively protect our right the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our cost of enforcing our right may increase we may be unable to obtain necessary hardware software and operational support we depend on third party vendor to supply with significant amount of the hardware software and operational support necessary to provide certain of our product and service some of these vendor represent our primary source of supply or grant the right to incorporate their

condition also negatively impact our advertising revenue the performance of our film and home entertainment release and attendance and spending in our theme park weak economic condition and disruption in the global financial market may also have an impact on the ability of third party to satisfy their obligation to or increase our exposure to currency fluctuation in country where we operate in addition in connection with our acquisition of sky we incurred and assumed significant amount of additional debt if our business are negatively impacted by weak economic condition we may not be able to reduce the amount of our debt outstanding quickly expected further significant increase in interest rate or disruption in the global financial market may affect our ability to obtain financing or to refinance existing debt on acceptable term if at all and could increase the cost of our borrowing acquisition and other strategic initiative present many risk and we may not realize the financial

indefinite lived intangible asset including cable franchise right annually or more frequently whenever event or substantive change in circumstance indicate that the asset might be impaired the assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factor to determine whether the existence of event or circumstance lead to determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit or an indefinite lived intangible asset is le than it carrying amount quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment result in more likely than not determination or if qualitative assessment is not performed goodwillgoodwill result from business combination and represents the excess amount of the consideration paid over the identifiable asset and liability recorded in the acquisition we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and have concluded that our reporting unit are generally the same our reportable segment we evaluate the determination of our reporting unit periodically or whenever event or substantive change in circumstance occur when performing quantitative assessment we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit primarily based on discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment including market participant estimate of future cash flow expected to be generated by the business and the selection of discount rate when analyzing the fair value indicated under discounted cash flow model we also consider multiple of adjusted ebitda generated by the underlying asset current market transaction and profitability information we performed qualitative assessment for our reporting unit in this assessment considered change in our projected future cash flow and discount rate recent market transaction and overall macroeconomic condition based on this assessment we concluded that it wa more likely than not that the estimated fair value of our reporting unit were higher than their carrying value and that the performance of quantitative impairment test wa not required asset and liability resulting from business combination are initially recorded at fair value and the risk of goodwill impairment is reduced the value of the business in reporting unit increase and the carrying value of the reporting unit decrease due to the amortization of the historical cost of acquired long lived asset over time goodwill in our cable communication segment and our nbcuniversal segment ha resulted from the combination of legacy business and newly acquired business and result the fair value of the reporting unit are significantly in excess of the respective carrying value the goodwill in our sky segment resulted from our acquisition of sky in the fourth quarter of given this wa recent transaction the fair value is in close proximity to the carrying value of the sky reporting unit change in market condition law and regulation and key assumption made in future quantitative assessment including expected cash flow competitive factor and discount rate could negatively impact the result of future impairment testing and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge cable franchise rightsour cable franchise right asset result from agreement we have with state and local government that allow to construct and operate cable business within specified geographic area the value of franchise is derived from the economic benefit we receive from the right to solicit new customer and to market additional service in particular service area the amount we record for cable franchise right are primarily result of cable system acquisition typically when we acquire cable system the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise right often these cable system acquisition include multiple franchise area we currently serve approximately franchise area in the united state we have concluded that our cable franchise right have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factor which limit the period over which these right will contribute to our cash flow accordingly we do not amortize our cable franchise right comcast annual report on form table of contentsfor purpose of our impairment testing we have grouped the recorded value of our various cable franchise right into our three cable communication division or unit of account we evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level when performing quantitative assessment we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise right primarily based on discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment including the estimate of future cash flow and the selection of discount rate when analyzing the fair value indicated under the discounted cash flow model we also consider multiple of adjusted ebitda generated by the underlying asset current market transaction and profitability information in we performed qualitative assessment of our cable franchise right at the time of our previous quantitative assessment in the estimated fair value of our franchise right exceeded the carrying value of the northeast central and west division by and respectively we also considered various factor that would affect the estimated fair value of our cable franchise right in our qualitative assessment including change in our projected future cash flow associated with our cable communication segment market transaction and macroeconomic condition discount rate and change in our market capitalization based on this assessment we concluded that it wa more likely than not that the estimated fair value of our cable franchise right were higher than the carrying value and that

forecast computation method which amortizes the cost using the ratio of the current period revenue to estimated total remaining revenue from all source ultimate revenue estimate of ultimate revenue have significant impact on how quickly capitalized cost are amortized and therefore are updated regularly our estimate of ultimate revenue for film generally include revenue from all source that are expected to be earned within year from the date of film initial release these estimate are based on the historical performance of similar content well factor unique to the content itself the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue for film intended for theatrical release is the film theatrical performance subsequent revenue from the licensing and sale of film ha historically exhibited high correlation to it theatrical performance upon film release our estimate of revenue from succeeding market including from content licensing across multiple platform and home entertainment sale are revised based on historical relationship and an analysis of current market trend with respect to television series or other owned television programming the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue is whether the series can be successfully licensed beyond it initial license initial estimate of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue contracted for each episode under the initial license once it is determined that television series or other owned television programming can be licensed for subsequent platform revenue estimate for these platform such and international syndication home entertainment and other distribution platform are included in ultimate revenue revenue estimate for produced episode include revenue expected to be earned within year of delivery of the initial episode or if still in production year from the delivery of the most recent episode if later we capitalize the cost of programming right for content that we license but do not own at the earlier of when payment are made for the programming or when the license period begin and the content is made available for use we amortize capitalized programming cost the associated program are broadcast we recognize the cost of multiyear live event sport programming right the right are utilized over the contract term based on estimated relative value estimated relative value is generally based on the ratio of the current period revenue to the estimated ultimate revenue or the term of the contract advance payment for right to multiyear live event sport programming are included in programming right capitalized film and television cost are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering event are identified if the fair value of production were to fall below it unamortized cost we would record an adjustment for the amount by which the unamortized capitalized cost exceed the production fair value the fair value assessment is generally based on estimated future discounted cash flow which are supported by our internal forecast adjustment to capitalized film production cost were not material in any of the period presented annual report on form ktable of contentsfair value of acquisition related asset and liabilitieswe allocate the purchase price of acquired business to tangible and intangible asset and liability based

believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain part of the estimation process third party valuation specialist are engaged to assist in the valuation of certain of these asset and liability our judgment used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of asset acquired and liability assumed well asset life and depreciation and amortization method have material impact on our consolidated financial statement for instance the determination of asset life impact our result of operation different type of asset have different useful life and certain asset may be considered to have indefinite useful life intangible assetsintangible asset primarily consist of our estimate of fair value for finite lived customer relationship and indefinite lived trade name customer relationship were valued using discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment including the estimate of future cash flow and the selection of discount rate this measure of fair value also requires considerable judgment about future event including attrition contract renewal estimate and technology change in determining the estimated life and method of amortization for finite lived intangible we use method and life that closely follows the undiscounted cash flow over the estimated life of the asset trade name were valued using the relief from royalty method form of the income approach this measure of fair value requires considerable judgment about the value market participant would be willing to pay in order to achieve the benefit associated with the trade name property and equipmentproperty and equipment includes customer premise equipment well network asset real estate and other machinery and equipment property and equipment wa valued using the reproduction and replacement cost approach well cost approach for real estate the reproduction and replacement cost approach measure the value of an asset by estimating the cost to acquire or
