are able to negotiate appropriate term and condition of and enforce commercial and other agreement not successfully consummating favorable strategic transaction or integrating acquired business and the deterioration in our credit rating which could limit the availability of additional financing and increase the cost of obtaining financing to fund our initiative additionally our channel development business is also in part dependent on the level of support our retail business partner provide our product and in some market there are only retailer if our retail business partner do not provide sufficient level of support for our product which is at their discretion it could limit our ability to grow our channel development business also relatively small number of licensee partner own large number of licensed store if such licensee partner are not able to access sufficient fund or financing or are otherwise unable to successfully operate and grow their business including their licensed store it could adversely affect our result in the market in which they operate their licensed store effectively managing growth can be challenging particularly we continue to expand into new channel outside the retail store model increase our focus on our channel development and teavana business and expand into new market internationally where we must balance the need for flexibility and degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goal philosophy and standard growth can make it increasingly difficult to ensure consistent supply of high quality raw material to locate and hire sufficient number of key employee to maintain an effective system of internal control for globally dispersed enterprise and to train employee worldwide to deliver consistently high quality product and customer experience furthermore if we are not successful in implementing these strategic initiative we may be required to evaluate whether certain asset including goodwill and other intangible have become impaired in the event we record an impairment charge it could have material impact on our financial result we face intense competition in each of our channel and market which could lead to reduced profitability the specialty coffee market is intensely competitive including with respect to product quality innovation service convenience and price and we face significant and increasing competition in all these area in each of our channel and market accordingly we do not have leadership position in all channel and market in the the ongoing focus by large competitor in the quick service restaurant sector on selling high quality specialty coffee beverage could lead to decrease in customer traffic to starbucks store and or average value per transaction adversely affecting our sale and result of operation similarly continued competition from well established competitor in our international market could hinder growth and adversely affect our sale and result of operation in those market increased competition in the packaged coffee and tea and single serve and ready to drink coffee beverage market including from new and large entrant to this market could adversely affect the profitability of the channel development segment additionally decline in general consumer demand for specialty coffee product for any reason including due to consumer preference for other product could have negative effect on our business we are highly dependent on the financial performance of our america operating segment our financial performance is highly dependent on our america operating segment it comprised approximately of consolidated total net revenue in fiscal if the america operating segment revenue trend slow or decline especially in our and canada market our other segment may be unable to make up any significant shortfall and our business and financial result could be adversely affected and because the america segment is relatively mature and produce the large majority of our operating cash flow such slowdown or decline could result in reduced cash flow for funding the expansion of our international business and other initiative and for returning cash to shareholder we are increasingly dependent on the success of our cap and emea operating segment in order to achieve our growth target our future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of our cap and emea operating segment some or all of our international market business unit mbus which we generally define by the country in which they operate may not be successful in their operation or in achieving expected growth which ultimately requires achieving consistent stable net revenue and earnings the performance of these international operation may be adversely affected by economic downturn in one or more of the country in which our large mbus operate in particular both our china and japan mbus contribute meaningfully to both net revenue and earnings for our cap segment in the emea segment our uk mbu account for significant portion of the net revenue decline in performance of any of these mbus could have material adverse impact on the result of our international operation of contentsadditionally some factor that will be critical to the success of the cap and emea segment are different than those affecting our store and licensee taste naturally vary by region and consumer in some mbus may not embrace our product to the same extent consumer in the or other international market occupancy cost and store operating expense can be higher internationally than in the due to higher rent for prime store location or cost of compliance with country specific regulatory requirement because many of our international operation are in an early phase of development operating expense percentage of related revenue are often higher compared to more developed operation such in the additionally our international joint venture partner or licensee may face capital constraint or other factor that may limit the speed at which they are able to expand and develop in certain market our international operation are also subject to additional inherent risk of conducting business abroad such foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation or requirement to transact in specific currency change or uncertainty in economic legal regulatory social and political condition in our market interpretation and application of law and regulation restrictive action of foreign or governmental authority affecting trade and foreign investment especially during period of heightened tension the and such foreign governmental authority including protective measure such export and custom duty and tariff government intervention favoring local competitor and restriction on the level of foreign ownership import or other business licensing requirement the enforceability of intellectual property and contract right limitation on the repatriation of fund and foreign currency exchange restriction due to current or new and international regulation in developing economy the growth rate in the portion of the population achieving sufficient level of disposable income may not be fast we forecast difficulty in staffing developing and managing foreign operation and supply chain logistics including ensuring the consistency of product quality and service due to governmental action affecting supply chain logistics distance language and cultural difference well challenge in recruiting and retaining high quality employee in local market local law that make it more expensive and complex to negotiate with retain or terminate employee delay in store opening for reason beyond our control competition with locally relevant competitor or lack of desirable real estate location available for lease at reasonable rate any of which could keep from meeting annual store opening target and in turn negatively impact net revenue operating income and earnings per share and disruption in energy supply affecting our market moreover many of the foregoing risk are particularly acute in developing country which are important to our long term growth prospect increase in the cost of high quality arabica coffee bean or other commodity or decrease in the availability of high quality arabica coffee bean or other commodity could have an adverse impact on our business and financial result we purchase roast and sell high quality whole bean arabica coffee bean and related coffee product the price of coffee is subject to significant volatility and ha and may increase significantly due to one or more of the factor described below the high quality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on negotiated basis at premium above the price this premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly increase in the coffee commodity price do increase the price of high quality arabica coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixed price purchase commitment we frequently enter into supply contract whereby the quality quantity delivery period and other negotiated term are agreed upon but the date and therefore price at which the base coffee commodity price component will be fixed ha not yet been established these are known price to be fixed contract the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factor in the producing country including weather natural disaster crop disease general increase in farm input and cost of production inventory level and political and economic condition well the action of certain organization and association that have historically attempted to influence price of green coffee through agreement establishing export quota or by restricting coffee supply speculative trading in coffee commodity can also influence coffee price because of the significance of coffee bean to our operation combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practice and hedging activity increase in the cost of high quality arabica coffee bean could have an adverse impact on our profitability in addition if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantity of green coffee due to any of the above factor or to worldwide or regional shortage we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee which could have an adverse impact on our profitability of contentswe also purchase significant amount of dairy product particularly fluid milk to support the need of our company operated retail store additionally and although le significant to our operation than coffee or dairy other commodity including but not limited to tea and those related to food input such cocoa produce baking ingredient meat egg and energy well the processing of these input are important to our operation increase in the cost of dairy product and other commodity or lack of availability whether due to supply shortage delay or interruption in processing or otherwise especially in international market could have an adverse impact on our profitability our financial condition and result

market labor discord war terrorism including incident targeting political instability boycott social unrest and natural disaster including health pandemic that lead to avoidance of public place or restriction on public gathering such in our store interruption of our supply chain could affect our ability to produce or deliver our product and could negatively impact our business and profitability any material interruption in our supply chain such material interruption of roasted coffee supply due to the casualty loss of any of our roasting plant interruption in service by our third party logistic service provider or common carrier that ship good within our distribution channel trade restriction such increased tariff or quota embargo or custom restriction or natural disaster that cause material disruption in our supply chain could negatively impact our business and our profitability additionally our food beverage and other product are sourced from wide variety of domestic and international business partner in our supply chain operation and in certain case are produced or sourced by our licensee directly we rely on these supplier and vendor to provide high quality product and to comply with applicable law our ability to find qualified supplier and vendor who meet our standard and supply product in timely and efficient manner is significant challenge especially with

manner or comply with applicable law is beyond our control these issue especially for those product for which we rely on one or few supplier or vendor could negatively impact our business and profitability failure to meet market expectation for our financial performance will likely adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock failure to meet market expectation going

critical accounting policiescritical accounting policy are those that management belief are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and result and require the most difficult subjective or complex judgment often result of the need to make estimate about the effect of matter that are inherently uncertain judgment and uncertainty affecting the application of those policy may result in materially different amount being reported under different condition or using different assumption our significant accounting policy are discussed in note summary of significant accounting policy to the consolidated financial statement included in item of part ii of this we believe that of our significant accounting policy the following policy involve higher degree of judgment and or complexity we consider financial reporting and disclosure practice and accounting policy quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment during the past three fiscal year we have not made any material change to the accounting methodology used to ass the area discussed below unless noted otherwise property plant and equipment and other finite lived assetswe evaluate property plant and equipment and other finite lived asset for impairment when fact and circumstance indicate that the carrying value of such asset may not be recoverable when evaluating for impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset estimated future undiscounted cash flow if the estimated undiscounted future cash flow are le than the carrying value of the asset we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset carrying value exceeds it estimated fair value the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes it new cost basis and is depreciated over the asset remaining useful life long lived asset are grouped with other asset and liability at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flow are largely independent of the cash flow of other asset and liability for company operated store asset the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level the fair value of store asset is estimated using discounted cash flow model for other long lived asset fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant fact and circumstance which may include discounted cash flow comparable transaction or comparable company analysis of contentsour impairment calculation contain uncertainty because they require management to make assumption and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flow and asset fair value key assumption used in estimating future cash flow and asset fair value include projected revenue growth and operating expense well forecasting asset useful life and selecting an appropriate discount rate for company operated store estimate of revenue growth and operating expense are based on internal projection and consider the store historical performance the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store performance the discount rate is selected based on we believe buyer would assume when determining purchase price for the store these estimate are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flow and asset fair value is affected by factor such ongoing maintenance and improvement of the asset change in economic condition and change in operating performance during fiscal there were no significant change in any of our estimate or assumption that had material impact on the outcome of our impairment calculation however we periodically reassess estimated future cash flow and asset fair value change in our estimate and assumption may cause to realize material impairment charge in the future goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset primarily trade name and trademark for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstance change that would indicate that impairment may exist when evaluating for impairment we may first perform qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that reporting unit or intangible asset group is impaired if we do not perform qualitative assessment or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset group exceeds it carrying amount we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset group fair value is the price market participant would pay for the reporting unit or intangible asset and is typically calculated using an income approach such discounted cash flow or relief from royalty method for certain reporting unit where deemed appropriate we may also utilize market approach under the market approach fair value is estimated by reviewing price in market transaction involving identical or comparable asset or liability with similar risk profile if the carrying amount of the reporting unit or intangible asset group exceeds the estimated fair value an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value our decision to perform qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit in given year is influenced by number of factor inclusive of the size of the reporting unit goodwill the significance of the excess of the reporting unit estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessment and the date of acquisition during fiscal part of our annual goodwill impairment analysis we performed the qualitative assessment for approximately million or of our total goodwill balance of billion the majority of which resides in our japan retail company operated and canada company operated reporting unit our japan retail reporting unit which wa acquired in fiscal represented approximately million of the goodwill balance that wa assessed qualitatively part of our ongoing operation we may close certain store within reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease among other reason we may abandon certain asset associated with closed store including leasehold improvement and other non transferable asset when portion of reporting unit that constitutes business is to be disposed of the associated goodwill is included in the carrying amount when determining any loss on disposal our evaluation of whether the portion of reporting unit being disposed of constitutes business occurs on the date of abandonment although an operating store meet the accounting definition of business prior to abandonment it doe not constitute business on the closure date because the remaining asset on that date do not constitute an integrated set of asset that are capable of being managed for the purpose of providing return to investor result when closing individual store we do not include goodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related asset if store closure are indicative of potential impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level we perform an evaluation of our reporting unit goodwill when such closure occur our impairment calculation contain uncertainty because they require management to make assumption and to apply judgment when performing qualitative assessment or when estimating future cash flow and asset fair value key assumption used in estimating future cash flow and asset fair value typically include projected revenue growth and operating expense related to existing business product innovation and new store concept well selecting an appropriate discount rate for indefinite lived intangible asset management also make assumption around the royalty rate that could hypothetically be charged by licensor of the asset to an unrelated licensee for goodwill reporting unit estimate of revenue growth and operating expense are based on internal projection considering the reporting unit past performance and forecasted growth strategic initiative local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit performance the discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for market participant to operate the reporting unit in the region for indefinite lived intangible asset estimate of revenue growth are based on internal projection considering the intangible asset group past performance and forecasted growth and the royalty rate used is based on observed market royalty rate for similar licensing arrangement adjusted for our particular fact and circumstance the discount rate is of contentsselected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business these estimate are highly subjective judgment and our ability to realize the future cash flow used in our fair value calculation is affected by factor such the success of strategic initiative change in economic condition change in our operating performance and change in our business strategy including retail initiative and international expansion for fiscal we determined the fair value of our material reporting unit and intangible asset group were significantly in excess of their carrying value accordingly we did not recognize any material impairment charge during the current fiscal year during fiscal there were no significant change in any of our estimate or assumption that had material impact on the outcome of our impairment calculation however we periodically reassess estimated future cash flow and asset fair value change in our estimate and assumption may cause to realize material impairment charge in the future income taxeswe recognize deferred tax asset and liability based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amount and the respective tax base of our asset and liability deferred tax asset and liability are measured using current enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which we expect the temporary difference to reverse we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax asset and may record valuation allowance if based on all available evidence we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized change in tax law and rate may affect recorded deferred tax asset and liability and our effective tax rate in the future however we do not expect change from recently enacted tax law to be material to the consolidated financial statement in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax asset within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversal of deferred tax liability projected future taxable income tax planning strategy and result of operation in projecting future taxable income we consider historical result and incorporate assumption about the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for item that do not have tax consequence our assumption regarding future taxable income

of these instrument for trading and government treasury security and commodity future contract we use quoted price in active market for identical asset to determine fair value level when quoted price in active market for identical asset are not available we determine the fair value of our available for sale security and our over the counter forward contract collar and swap based upon factor such the quoted market price of similar asset or discounted cash flow model using readily observable market data which may include interest rate curve and forward and spot price for currency and commodity

derivative instrument including forward contract commodity future contract collar and swap forward contract and commodity future contract are agreement to buy or sell quantity of currency or commodity at predetermined future date and at predetermined rate or price collar is strategy that us combination of purchased call option and sold put option with equal premium to hedge portion of anticipated

method of september and september inventory reserve were million and million respectively property plant and equipmentproperty plant and equipment which includes asset under capital lease are carried at cost le accumulated depreciation cost includes all direct cost necessary to acquire and prepare asset for use including internal labor and overhead in some case depreciation is computed using the straight line method over estimated useful life of the asset generally ranging from to year for equipment and to year for building leasehold improvement are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the related lease life generally year for lease with renewal period at our option we generally use the original lease term excluding renewal option period to determine estimated useful life if failure to exercise renewal option imposes an economic penalty to we may determine at the inception of the lease that renewal is reasonably assured and include the renewal option period in the determination of the appropriate estimated useful life the portion of depreciation expense related to production and distribution facility is included in cost of sale including occupancy cost on our consolidated statement of earnings the cost of repair and maintenance are expensed when incurred while expenditure for refurbishment and improvement that significantly add to the productive capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized when asset are disposed of whether through retirement or sale the net gain or loss is recognized in net earnings long lived asset to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value le estimated cost to sell we evaluate property plant and equipment for impairment when fact and circumstance indicate that the carrying value of such asset may not be recoverable when evaluating for impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset estimated future undiscounted cash flow if the estimated undiscounted future cash flow are le than the carrying value of the asset we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset carrying value exceeds it estimated fair value the fair value of the asset is estimated using discounted cash flow model based on forecasted future revenue and operating cost using internal projection property plant and equipment asset are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flow are largely independent of the cash flow of other asset and liability for company operated store asset the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level we recognized net disposition charge of million million and million and net impairment charge of million million and million in fiscal and respectively the nature of the underlying asset that is impaired or disposed of will determine the operating expense line on which the related impact is recorded on our consolidated statement of earnings for asset within our retail operation net impairment and disposition charge are recorded in store operating expense for all other asset these charge are recorded in cost of sale including occupancy cost other operating expense or general and administrative expense goodwillwe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstance change such material deterioration in performance or significant number of store closure that would indicate that impairment may exist when evaluating goodwill for impairment we may first perform qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that reporting unit is impaired if we do not perform qualitative assessment or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds it carrying amount we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit fair value is the price willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is typically calculated using discounted cash flow model for certain reporting unit where deemed appropriate we may also utilize market approach for estimating fair value if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value part of our ongoing operation we may close certain store within reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease among other reason we may abandon certain asset associated with closed store including leasehold improvement and other non transferable asset when portion of reporting unit that constitutes business is to be disposed of goodwill associated with the business is included in the carrying amount of the business in determining any loss on disposal our evaluation of whether the portion of reporting unit being disposed of constitutes business occurs on the date of abandonment although an operating store meet the accounting definition of business prior to abandonment it doe not constitute business on the closure date because the remaining asset on that date do not constitute an integrated set of asset that are capable of being managed for the purpose of providing return to investor result when closing individual store we do not include goodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related asset noted above if store closure are indicative of potential impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level we perform an evaluation of our reporting unit goodwill when such closure occur there were no material goodwill impairment charge recorded during fiscal and of contentsother intangible assetsother intangible asset consist primarily of finite lived intangible asset which mainly consist of acquired and reacquired right trade secret licensing agreement contract based patent and copyright are amortized over their estimated useful life and are tested for impairment using similar methodology to our property plant and equipment described above indefinite lived intangible which consist primarily of trade name and trademark are tested for impairment annually during the third fiscal quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstance change that would indicate that impairment may exist when evaluating other intangible asset for impairment we may first perform qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an intangible asset group is impaired if we do not perform the qualitative assessment or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset group exceeds it carrying amount we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset group fair value is the price willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is typically calculated using an income approach such relief from royalty model if the carrying amount of the intangible asset group exceeds the estimated fair value an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value in addition we continuously monitor and may revise our intangible asset useful life if and when fact and circumstance change there were no other intangible asset impairment charge recorded during fiscal and insurance reserveswe use combination of insurance and self insurance mechanism including wholly owned captive insurance entity and
