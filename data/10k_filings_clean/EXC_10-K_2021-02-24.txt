primarily include change to and compliance with the law and regulation that govern the design of power market zec program utility regulatory business model environmental and climate policy and tax policy operational factor primarily include change in the global climate could produce extreme weather event which could put the registrant facility at risk and such change could also affect the level and pattern of demand for energy and related service the safe secure and effective operation of generation nuclear facility and the ability to effectively manage the associated decommissioning obligation the ability of the registrant to maintain the reliability resiliency and safety of their energy delivery system which could affect the operating cost of the registrant and the opinion of their customer and regulator and physical and cyber security risk for the registrant the owner operator of generation transmission and distribution facility and participant in commodity trading risk related to the planned separation primarily include the timing and condition associated with required regulatory approval which may affect the cost to achieve the separation and it timing challenge to achieving the benefit of separation including maintaining investment grade credit rating and the risk that the separation could be treated taxable transaction to both exelon and it shareholder there may be further risk and uncertainty that are not presently known or that are not currently believed by the registrant to be material that could negatively affect it consolidated financial statement in the future market and financial factorsgeneration is exposed to price volatility associated with both the wholesale and retail power market and the procurement of nuclear and fossil fuel exelon and generation generation is exposed to commodity price risk for the unhedged portion of it electricity generation supply portfolio generation earnings and cash flow are therefore exposed to variability of spot and forward market price in the market in which it operates of contentsprice of fuel the spot market price of electricity for each hour is generally determined by the marginal cost of supplying the next unit of electricity to the market during that hour thus the market price of power is affected by the market price of the marginal fuel used to generate the electricity unit demand and supply the market price for electricity is also affected by change in the demand for electricity and the available supply of electricity unfavorable economic condition milder normal weather and the growth of energy efficiency and demand response program could each depress demand in addition in some market the supply of electricity could often exceed demand during some hour of the day resulting in loss of revenue for base load generating plant such generation nuclear plant conversely new demand source such electrification of transportation could increase demand and change demand pattern retail competition generation retail operation compete for customer in competitive environment which affect the margin that generation can earn and the volume that it is able to serve in period of sustained low natural gas and power price and low market volatility retail competitor can aggressively pursue market share because the barrier to entry can be low and wholesale generator including generation use their retail operation to hedge generation output the impact of sustained low market price or depressed demand and over supply could be emphasized given generation concentration of base load electric generating capacity within primarily two geographic market region namely the midwest and the mid atlantic these impact could adversely affect generation ability to fund regulated utility growth for the benefit of customer reduce debt and provide attractive shareholder return in addition such condition may no longer support the continued operation of certain generating facility which could adversely affect generation financial statement primarily through accelerated depreciation and amortization expense and one time charge see note early plant retirement of the combined note to consolidated financial statement for additional information cost of fuel generation depends on nuclear fuel and fossil fuel to operate most of it generating facility the supply market for nuclear fuel natural gas and oil are subject to price fluctuation availability restriction and counterparty default market design the wholesale market vary from region to region with distinct rule practice and procedure change in these market rule problem with rule implementation or failure of any of these market could adversely affect generation business in addition significant decrease in market participation could affect market liquidity and have detrimental effect on market stability the registrant are potentially affected by emerging technology that could over time affect or transform the energy industry all registrant some of these technology include but are not limited to further development or application of technology related to shale gas production renewable energy technology energy efficiency distributed generation and energy storage device such development could affect the price of energy level of customer owned generation customer expectation and current business model and make portion of our electric system power supply and transmission and or distribution facility obsolete prior to the end of their useful life such technology could also result in further decline in commodity price or demand for delivered energy each of these factor could affect the registrant consolidated financial statement through among other thing reduced operating revenue increased operating and maintenance expense increased capital expenditure and potential asset impairment charge or accelerated depreciation and decommissioning expense over shortened remaining asset useful life market performance and other factor could decrease the value of ndt fund and employee benefit plan asset and could increase the related employee benefit plan obligation which could require significant additional funding all registrant disruption in the capital market and their actual or perceived effect on particular business and the greater economy could adversely affect the value of the investment held within generation ndts and exelon employee benefit plan trust the registrant have significant obligation in these area and exelon and generation hold substantial asset in these trust to meet those obligation the asset value are subject to market fluctuation and will yield uncertain return which could fall below the registrant projected return rate decline in the market value of the ndt fund investment could increase generation funding requirement to of contentsdecommission it nuclear plant decline in the market value of the pension and opeb

interest rate decrease the liability increase potentially increasing benefit cost and funding requirement change in demographic including increased number of retirement or change in life expectancy assumption or change to social security or medicare eligibility requirement could also increase the cost and funding requirement of the obligation related to the pension and opeb plan see note asset retirement obligation and note retirement benefit of the combined note to consolidated financial statement for additional information the registrant could be negatively affected by unstable capital and credit market and increased volatility in commodity market all registrant the registrant rely on the capital market particularly for publicly offered debt well the banking and commercial paper market to meet their financial commitment and short term liquidity need disruption in the capital and credit market in the united state or abroad could negatively affect the registrant ability to access the capital market or draw on their respective bank revolving credit facility the bank may not be able to meet their funding commitment to the registrant if they experience shortage of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volume of borrowing request within short period of time the inability to access capital market or credit facility and longer term disruption in the capital and credit market result of uncertainty changing or increased regulation reduced alternative or failure of significant financial institution could result in the deferral of discretionary capital expenditure generation ability to hedge effectively it generation portfolio change to generation hedging strategy in order to reduce collateral posting requirement or reduction in dividend payment or other discretionary us of cash in addition the registrant have exposure to worldwide financial market including europe canada and asia disruption in these market could reduce or restrict the registrant ability to secure sufficient liquidity or secure liquidity at reasonable term of december approximately and of the registrant available credit facility were with european canadian and asian bank respectively see note debt and credit agreement of the combined note to consolidated financial statement for additional information on the credit facility the strength and depth of competition in energy market depend heavily on active participation by multiple trading party which could be negatively affected by disruption in the capital and credit market and legislative and regulatory initiative that could affect participant in commodity transaction reduced capital and liquidity and failure of significant institution that participate in the energy market could diminish the liquidity and competitiveness of energy market that are important to the respective business of the registrant perceived weakness in the competitive strength of the energy market could lead to pressure for greater regulation of those market or attempt to replace market structure with other mechanism for the sale of power including the requirement of long term contract if any of the registrant were to experience downgrade in it credit rating to below investment grade or otherwise fail to satisfy the credit standard in it agreement with it counterparties it would be required to provide significant amount of collateral under it agreement with counterparties and could experience higher borrowing cost all registrant generation business is subject to credit quality standard that

otherwise fail to satisfy the credit standard of trading counterparties it would be required under it hedging arrangement to provide collateral in the form of letter of credit or cash which could have material adverse effect upon it liquidity the amount of collateral required to be provided by generation at any point in time depends on variety of factor including the notional amount of the applicable hedge the nature of counterparty and related agreement and change in power or other commodity price in addition if generation were downgraded it could experience higher borrowing cost result of the downgrade change in rating methodology by the credit rating agency could also have negative impact on the rating of generation generation ha project specific financing arrangement and must meet the requirement of various agreement relating to those financing failure to meet those arrangement could give rise to project specific financing default which if not cured or waived could result in the specific project being required to repay the associated of contentsdebt or other borrowing earlier than otherwise anticipated and if such repayment were not made the lender or security holder would generally have broad remedy including right to foreclose against the project asset and related collateral or to force the exelon subsidiary in the project specific financing to enter into bankruptcy proceeding the impact of bankruptcy could result in the impairment of certain project asset the utility registrant operating agreement with pjm and peco bge and dpl natural gas procurement contract contain collateral provision that are affected by their credit rating and market price if certain wholesale market condition were to exist and the utility registrant were to lose their investment grade credit rating based on their senior unsecured debt rating they would be required to provide collateral in the form of letter of credit or cash which could have material adverse effect upon their remaining source of liquidity pjm collateral posting requirement will generally increase market price rise and decrease market price fall collateral posting requirement for peco bge and dpl with respect to their natural gas supply contract will generally increase forward market price fall and decrease forward market price rise if the utility registrant were downgraded they could experience higher borrowing cost result of the downgrade in addition change in rating methodology by the agency could also have an adverse negative impact on the rating of the utility registrant the utility registrant conduct their respective business and operate under governance model and other arrangement and procedure intended to assure that the utility registrant are treated separate independent company distinct from exelon and other exelon subsidiary in order to isolate the utility registrant from exelon and other exelon subsidiary in the event of financial difficulty at exelon or another exelon subsidiary these measure commonly referred to ring fencing could help avoid or limit downgrade in the credit rating of the utility registrant in the event of reduction in the credit rating of exelon despite these ring fencing measure the credit rating of the utility registrant could remain linked to some degree to the credit rating of exelon consequently reduction in the credit rating of exelon could result in reduction of the credit rating of some or all of the utility registrant reduction in the credit rating of utility registrant could have material adverse effect on the

produce additional energy from primarily it fossil facility or purchase additional energy in the spot or forward market in order to satisfy generation obligation to committed third party sale including the utility registrant these source generally have higher cost than generation incurs to produce energy from it nuclear station nuclear refueling outage in general refueling outage are planned to occur once every to month the total number of refueling outage along with their duration could have significant impact on generation result of operation when refueling outage last longer than anticipated or generation experience unplanned outage capacity factor decrease and generation face lower margin due to higher energy replacement cost and or lower energy sale and higher operating and maintenance cost nuclear fuel quality the quality of nuclear fuel utilized by generation could affect the efficiency and cost of generation operation remediation action could result in increased cost due to accelerated fuel amortization increased outage cost and or increased cost due to decreased generation capability operational risk operation at any of generation nuclear generation plant could degrade to the point where generation must shut the plant or operate at le than full capacity if this were to happen identifying and correcting the cause could require significant time and expense generation could choose to close plant rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning the plant to full capacity in either event generation could lose revenue and incur increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitment for plant operated but not wholly owned by generation generation could also incur liability to the co owner for nuclear plant not operated and not wholly owned by generation from which generation receives portion of the plant output generation result of operation are dependent on the operational performance of the operator and could be adversely affected by significant event at those plant additionally poor operating of contentsperformance at nuclear plant not owned by generation could result in increased regulation and reduced public support for nuclear fueled energy in addition closure of generating plant owned by others or extended interruption of generating plant or failure of transmission line could affect transmission system that could adversely affect the sale and delivery of electricity in market served by generation nuclear major incident risk and insurance the consequence of major incident could be severe and include loss of life and property damage any resulting liability from nuclear plant major incident within the united state owned or operated by generation or owned by others could exceed generation resource including insurance coverage generation is member of an industry mutual insurance company neil which provides property and business interruption insurance for generation nuclear operation uninsured loss and other expense to the extent not recovered from insurer or the nuclear industry could be borne by generation additionally an accident or other significant event at nuclear plant within the united state or abroad whether owned by generation or others could result in increased regulation and reduced public support for nuclear fueled energy required by the price anderson act generation carry the maximum available amount of nuclear liability insurance million for each operating site claim exceeding that amount are covered through mandatory participation in financial protection pool in addition the congress could impose revenue raising measure on the nuclear industry to pay claim exceeding the billion limit for single incident see note commitment and contingency of the combined note to consolidated financial statement for additional information of nuclear insurance decommissioning obligation and funding nrc regulation require that licensee of nuclear generating facility demonstrate reasonable assurance that fund will be available in certain minimum amount at the end of the life of the facility to decommission the facility generation recognizes liability the present value of the estimated future cost to decommission it nuclear facility the estimated liability is based on assumption in the approach and timing of decommissioning the nuclear facility estimation of decommissioning cost and federal and state regulatory requirement the cost of such decommissioning may substantially exceed such liability fact circumstance or our estimate may change including change in the approach and timing of decommissioning activity change in decommissioning cost change in federal or state regulatory requirement on the decommissioning of such facility other change in our estimate or generation ability to effectively execute on it planned decommissioning activity generation make contribution to certain trust fund of the former peco unit based on amount being collected by peco from it customer and remitted to generation while generation through peco ha recourse to collect additional amount from peco customer subject to certain limitation and threshold it ha no recourse to collect additional amount from utility customer for any of it other nuclear unit if there is shortfall of fund necessary for decommissioning if circumstance changed such that generation would be unable to continue to make contribution to the trust fund of the former peco unit based on amount collected from peco customer or if generation no longer had recourse to collect additional amount from peco customer if there wa shortfall of fund for decommissioning the adequacy of the trust fund related to the former peco unit could be negatively affected should the expected value of the ndt fund for any former comed unit fall below the amount of the expected decommissioning obligation for that unit the accounting to offset decommissioning related activity in the consolidated statement of operation and comprehensive income for that unit would be discontinued the decommissioning related activity would be recognized in the consolidated statement of operation and comprehensive income and the adverse impact to exelon and generation financial statement could be material any change to the existing peco regulatory agreement could impact exelon and generation ability to offset decommissioning related activity within the consolidated statement of operation and comprehensive income and the impact to exelon and generation financial statement could be material forecasting trust fund investment earnings and cost to decommission nuclear generating station requires significant judgment and actual result could differ significantly from current estimate if the investment held by generation ndt fund are not sufficient to fund the decommissioning of generation nuclear unit generation could be required to take step such providing financial guarantee through letter of credit or parent of contentscompany guarantee or making additional contribution to the trust which could be significant to ensure that the trust are adequately funded and that current and future nrc minimum funding requirement are met see note asset retirement obligation of the combined note to consolidated financial statement for additional information the utility registrant operating cost are affected by their ability to maintain the availability and reliability of their delivery and operational system exelon and the utility registrant failure of the equipment or facility used in the utility registrant delivery system could interrupt the electric transmission and electric and natural gas delivery which could result in loss of revenue and an increase in maintenance and capital expenditure equipment or facility failure can be due to number of factor including natural cause such weather or information system failure specifically if the implementation of ami smart grid or other technology in the utility registrant service territory fail to perform intended or are not successfully integrated with billing and other information system or if any of the financial accounting or other data processing system fail or have other significant shortcoming the utility registrant financial result could be negatively impacted in addition dependence upon automated system could further increase the risk that operational system flaw or internal and or external tampering or manipulation of those system will result in loss that are difficult to detect regulated utility which are required to provide service to all customer within their service territory have generally been afforded liability protection against claim by customer relating to failure of service under illinois law however comed could be required to pay damage to it customer in some circumstance involving extended outage affecting large number of it customer which could be material the registrant are subject to physical security and cybersecurity risk all registrant the registrant face physical security and cybersecurity risk threat source continue to seek to exploit potential vulnerability in the electric and natural gas utility industry associated with protection of sensitive and confidential information grid infrastructure and other energy infrastructure and such attack and disruption both physical and cyber are becoming increasingly sophisticated and dynamic continued implementation of advanced digital technology increase the potentially unfavorable impact of such attack security breach of the physical asset or information system of the registrant their competitor vendor business partner and interconnected entity in rtos and isos or regulator could impact the operation of the generation fleet and or reliability of the transmission and distribution system or result in the theft or inappropriate release of certain type of information including critical infrastructure information sensitive customer vendor and employee data trading or other confidential data the risk of these system related event and security breach occurring continues to intensify and while the registrant have been and will likely continue to be subjected to physical and cyber attack to date none ha directly experienced material breach or disruption to it network or information system or our service operation however such attack continue to increase in sophistication and frequency the registrant may be unable to prevent all such attack in the future if significant breach were to occur the reputation of the registrant could be negatively affected customer confidence in the registrant or others in the industry could be diminished or the registrant could be subject to legal claim loss of revenue increased cost or operation shutdown moreover the amount and scope of insurance maintained against loss resulting from any such event or security breach may not be sufficient to cover loss or otherwise adequately compensate for any disruption to business that could result the utility registrant deployment of smart meter throughout their service territory could increase the risk of damage from an intentional disruption of the system by third party in addition new or updated security regulation or unforeseen threat source could require change in current measure taken by the registrant or their business operation and could adversely affect their consolidated financial statement the registrant employee contractor customer and the general public could be exposed to risk of injury due to the nature of the energy industry all registrant employee and contractor throughout the organization work in and customer and the general public could be exposed to potentially dangerous environment near the registrant operation result employee of contentscontractors customer and the general public are at some risk for serious injury including loss of life these risk include nuclear accident dam failure gas explosion pole strike and electric contact case natural disaster war act and threat of terrorism pandemic and other significant event could negatively impact the registrant result of operation their ability to raise capital and their future growth all registrant generation fleet of power plant and the utility registrant distribution and transmission infrastructure could be affected by natural disaster and extreme weather event which could result in increased cost including supply chain cost an extreme weather event within the registrant service area can also directly affect their capital asset causing disruption in service to customer due to downed wire and pole or damage to other operating equipment natural disaster and other significant event increase the risk to generation that the nrc or other regulatory or legislative body could change the law or regulation governing among other thing operation maintenance licensed life decommissioning snf storage insurance emergency planning security and environmental and radiological matter in addition natural disaster could affect the availability of secure and economical supply of water in some location which is essential for generation continued operation particularly the cooling of generating unit the impact that potential terrorist attack could have on the industry and on exelon is uncertain the registrant face risk that their operation would be direct target or indirect casualty of an act of terror any retaliatory military strike or sustained military campaign could affect their operation in unpredictable way such change in insurance market and disruption of fuel supply and market particularly oil furthermore these catastrophic event could compromise the physical or cybersecurity of exelon facility which could adversely affect exelon ability to manage it business effectively instability in the financial market result of terrorism war natural disaster pandemic credit crisis recession or other factor also could result in decline in energy consumption or interruption of fuel or the supply chain in addition the implementation of security guideline and measure ha resulted in and is expected to continue to result in increased cost the registrant could be significantly affected by the outbreak of pandemic exelon ha plan in place to respond to pandemic however depending on the severity of pandemic and the resulting impact to workforce and other resource availability the ability to operate exelon generating and transmission and distribution asset could be affected in addition exelon maintains level of insurance coverage consistent with industry practice against property casualty and cybersecurity loss subject to unforeseen occurrence or catastrophic event that could damage or destroy asset or interrupt operation however there can be no assurance that the amount of insurance will be adequate to address such property and casualty loss the registrant business are capital intensive and their asset could require significant expenditure to maintain and are subject to operational failure which could result in potential liability all registrant the registrant business are capital intensive and require significant investment by generation in electric generating facility and by the utility registrant in transmission and distribution infrastructure project equipment even if maintained in accordance with good utility practice is subject to operational failure including event that are beyond the registrant control and could require significant expenditure to operate efficiently the registrant consolidated financial statement could be negatively affected if they were unable to effectively manage their capital project or raise the necessary capital see item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation liquidity and capital resource for additional information regarding the registrant potential future capital expenditure the utility registrant respective ability to deliver electricity their operating cost and their capital expenditure could be negatively impacted by transmission congestion and failure of neighboring transmission system exelon and the utility registrant demand for electricity within the utility registrant service area could stress available transmission capacity requiring alternative routing or curtailment of electricity usage also insufficient availability of electric supply to meet customer demand could jeopardize the utility registrant ability to comply with reliability standard and strain customer and regulatory agency relationship with all utility potential concern over transmission of contentscapacity or generation facility retirement could result in pjm or ferc requiring the utility registrant to upgrade or expand their respective transmission system through additional capital expenditure pjm system and operation are designed to ensure the reliable operation of the transmission grid and prevent the operation of one utility from an adverse impact on the operation of the other utility however service interruption at other utility may cause interruption in the utility registrant service area the registrant consolidated financial statement could be negatively affected if they fail to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce all registrant certain event such an employee strike loss of contract resource due to major event and an aging workforce without appropriate replacement could lead to operating challenge and increased cost for the registrant the challenge include lack of resource loss of knowledge and lengthy time period associated with skill development in this case cost including cost for contractor to replace employee productivity cost and safety cost could arise the registrant are particularly affected due to the specialized knowledge required of the technical and support employee for their generation transmission and distribution operation the registrant could make acquisition or investment in new business initiative and new market which may not be successful or achieve the intended financial result all registrant generation could continue to pursue growth in it existing business and market and further diversification across the competitive energy value chain this could include investment opportunity in renewables development of natural gas generation nuclear advisory or operating service for third party distributed generation potential expansion of the existing wholesale gas business and entry into lng such initiative could involve significant risk and uncertainty including distraction of management from current operation inadequate return on capital and unidentified issue not discovered during diligence performed prior to launching an initiative or entering market additionally it is possible that ferc state public utility commission or others could impose certain other restriction on such transaction all of these factor could result in higher cost or lower revenue than expected resulting in lower than planned return on investment the utility registrant face risk associated with their regulatory mandated initiative such smart grid and utility of the future these risk include but are not limited to cost recovery regulatory concern cybersecurity and obsolescence of technology such initiative may not be successful the registrant may not realize or achieve the anticipated cost saving through the cost management effort all registrant the registrant future financial performance and level of profitability is dependent in part on various cost reduction initiative the registrant may encounter challenge in executing these cost reduction initiative and not achieve the intended cost saving risk related to the planned separation exelon and generation the planned separation is contingent upon regulatory approval and satisfaction of other condition and may not be completed in accordance with the expected plan or anticipated timeline or at all which could negatively affect exelon and generation consolidated financial statement exelon is targeting to complete the separation in the first quarter of subject to final approval by exelon board of director form registration statement being declared effective by the sec regulatory approval and satisfaction of other condition the planned separation is subject to approval by the ferc nrc and nypsc there can be no assurance that any separation transaction will ultimately occur or if one doe occur of it term

stock may be affected of contentsthe plan to separate into two publicly traded company will involve significant time and expense which could disrupt or adversely affect our business the planned separation is complex in nature and unanticipated development or change including challenge in executing the separation could delay or prevent the completion of the proposed separation or cause the separation to occur on term or condition that are different or le favorable than expected additionally exelon board of director in it sole and absolute discretion may decide not to proceed with the separation at any time prior to the distribution date the process of completing the proposed separation ha been and is expected to continue to be time consuming and involves significant cost and expense the planned separation may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefit and each separate company following the separation may underperform relative to exelon expectation by separating the utility registrant and generation exelon is creating two publicly traded company with the resource necessary to best serve customer and sustain long term investment and operating excellence the separate company are expected to create value by having the strategic flexibility to focus on their unique customer market and community priority however the planned separation may not provide such result on the scope or scale that exelon anticipates and exelon and generation may not realize the anticipated benefit of the planned separation failure to do so could have material adverse effect on the financial statement of each separate company and their respective common stock price following the planned separation the company anticipate to maintain investment grade credit rating rating are based upon assessment of multiple factor including company credit metric well industry and macroeconomic change and trend if rating agency were to downgrade the rating below investment grade the separate company borrowing cost would increase and their funding source could decrease which could have material adverse effect on the financial statement of the affected company the common stock of the separately publicly traded company following the separation may collectively trade at value le than the price at which exelon common stock might have traded had the separation not occurred there could be significant liability if the planned spin off is determined to be taxable transaction under the separation plan exelon shareholder will retain their current share of exelon stock and receive pro rata distribution of share of the new company stock in transaction that is expected to be tax free to exelon and it shareholder under section and of the irc exelon will seek private letter ruling from the irs regarding the tax free nature of the transaction exelon will also seek from it tax advisor an opinion with respect to certain federal income tax consequence of the spin off if the planned

depreciable life of property plant and equipment all registrant the registrant have significant investment in electric generation asset and electric and natural gas transmission and distribution asset these asset are generally depreciated on straight line basis using the group composite or unitary method of depreciation the group approach is typically for group of similar asset that have approximately the same useful life and the composite approach is used for heterogeneous asset that have different life under both method reporting entity depreciates the asset over the average life of the asset in the group the estimation of asset useful life requires management judgment supported by formal depreciation study of historical asset retirement experience depreciation study are generally completed every five year or more frequently if required by rate regulator or if an event regulatory action or change in retirement pattern indicate an update is necessary for the utility registrant depreciation study generally serve the basis for amount allowed in customer rate for recovery of depreciation cost generally the utility registrant adjust their depreciation rate for

considers historical economic indicator including inflation and gdp growth that impact asset return well expectation regarding future long term capital market performance weighted by exelon target asset class allocation exelon calculates the amount of expected return on pension and opeb plan asset by multiplying the eroa by the mrv of plan asset at the beginning of the year taking into consideration anticipated contribution and benefit payment to be made during the year in determining mrv the authoritative guidance for pension and postretirement benefit allows the use of either fair value or calculated value that recognizes change in fair value in systematic and rational manner over not more than five year for the majority of pension plan asset exelon us calculated value that adjusts for of the difference between fair value and expected mrv of plan asset use of this calculated value approach enables le volatile expected asset return to be recognized component of pension

on the yield to maturity of universe of high quality non callable or callable with make whole provision bond with similar maturity to the related pension and opeb obligation the spot rate are used to discount the estimated future benefit distribution amount under the pension and opeb plan the discount rate is the single level rate that produce the same result the spot rate curve exelon utilizes an analytical tool developed by it actuary to determine the discount rate mortality the mortality assumption is composed of base table that represents the current expectation of life expectancy of the

issuance in nrc minimum funding requirement exelon and generation nrc regulation require that licensee of nuclear generating facility demonstrate reasonable assurance that sufficient fund will be available in certain minimum amount to decommission the facility these nrc minimum funding level are typically based upon the assumption that decommissioning activity will commence after the end of the current licensed life of each unit if unit fails the nrc minimum funding test then the plant owner or parent company would be required to take step such providing financial guarantee through letter of credit or parent company guarantee or making additional cash contribution to the ndt fund to ensure sufficient fund are available see note asset retirement obligation of the combined note to consolidated financial statement for additional information if nuclear plant were to early retire there is risk that it will no longer meet the nrc minimum funding requirement due to the earlier commencement of decommissioning activity and shorter time period over which the ndt fund could appreciate in value shortfall could require that generation address the shortfall by among other thing obtaining parental guarantee for generation share of the funding assurance however the amount of any guarantee or other assurance will ultimately depend on the decommissioning approach the associated level of cost and the ndt fund investment performance going forward within two year after shutting down plant generation must submit psdar to the nrc that includes the planned option for decommissioning the site upon retirement dresden will have adequate funding assurance however due to the earlier commencement of decommissioning activity and shorter time period over which the ndt fund investment could appreciate in value byron may no longer meet the nrc minimum funding requirement and result the nrc may require additional financial assurance including possibly parental guarantee from exelon considering the different approach to decommissioning available to generation the most likely estimate currently anticipated could require financial assurance for radiological decommissioning at byron of up to million of contentsupon issuance of any required financial guarantee each site would be able to utilize the respective ndt fund for radiological decommissioning cost which represent the majority of the total expected decommissioning cost however under the regulation the nrc must approve an exemption in order for generation to utilize the ndt fund to pay for non radiological decommissioning cost spent fuel management and site restoration cost if applicable if unit doe not receive this exemption those cost would be borne by generation without reimbursement from or access to the ndt fund accordingly based on current projection of the most likely decommissioning approach it is expected that dresden would not require supplemental cash from generation but some portion of the byron spent fuel management cost would need to be funded through supplemental cash from generation while the ultimate amount may vary and could be offset by reimbursement of certain spent fuel management cost under the doe settlement agreement decommissioning for byron may require supplemental cash from generation of up to million net of tax over period of year after permanent shutdown of december exelon would not be required to post parental guarantee for tmi unit under the safstor scenario which is the planned decommissioning option described in the tmi unit psdar filed by generation with the nrc on april on october the nrc granted generation exemption request to use the tmi unit ndt fund for spent fuel management cost an additional exemption request would be required to allow the fund to be spent on site restoration cost which are not expected to be incurred in the near term project financing exelon and generation project financing is used to help mitigate risk of specific generating asset project financing is based upon nonrecourse financial structure in which project debt is paid back from the cash generated by the specific asset or portfolio of asset borrowing under these agreement are secured by the asset and equity of each respective project the lender do not have recourse against exelon or generation in the event of default if specific project financing entity doe not maintain compliance with it specific debt financing covenant there could be requirement to accelerate repayment of the associated debt or other project related borrowing earlier than the stated maturity date in these instance if such repayment wa not satisfied or restructured the lender or security holder would generally have right to foreclose against the project specific asset and related collateral the potential requirement to satisfy it associated debt or other borrowing earlier than otherwise anticipated could lead to impairment due to

decision to retire mystic unit upon expiration of the cost of service agreement federal regulatory matterspjm and nyiso mopr proceeding pjm and nyiso capacity market include mopr if resource is subjected to mopr it offer is adjusted to effectively remove the revenue it receives through state government provided financial support program resulting in higher offer that may not clear the capacity market prior to december the mopr in pjm applied only to certain new gas fired resource currently the mopr in nyiso applies only to certain resource in downstate new york for generation facility in pjm and nyiso that are currently receiving zec compensation an expanded mopr would require exclusion of zec compensation when bidding into future capacity auction resulting in an increased risk of these facility not receiving capacity revenue in future auction on december ferc required pjm to broadly apply the mopr to all new and existing resource including nuclear renewables demand response energy efficiency storage and all resource owned by vertically integrated utility this greatly expands the breadth and scope of pjm mopr which is effective of pjm next capacity auction while ferc included some limited exemption no exemption were available to state supported nuclear resource ferc provided no new mechanism for accommodating state supported resource other than the existing frr mechanism under which an entire utility zone would be removed from pjm capacity auction along with sufficient resource to support the load in such zone in response to ferc order pjm submitted compliance filing on march wherein pjm proposed tariff language interpreting and implementing ferc directive and proposed schedule for resuming capacity auction that is contingent on the timing of ferc action on the compliance filing on april ferc issued an order largely denying most request for rehearing of ferc december order but granting few clarification that required an additional pjm compliance filing which pjm submitted on june on october ferc issued an order denying request for rehearing of it april order and accepting pjm two compliance filing subject to further compliance filing to revise minor aspect of the proposed mopr methodology part of that order ferc also accepted pjm proposal to condense the schedule of activity leading up to the next capacity auction in november pjm announced that it will conduct it next capacity auction beginning on may and ending on may and will post the result on june because neither illinois nor new jersey have implemented an frr program in their pjm zone the mopr will apply in that next capacity auction to generation owned or jointly owned nuclear plant in those state receiving benefit under the illinois or the new jersey zec program applicable increasing the risk that those unit may not clear the capacity market exelon is currently working with pjm and other stakeholder to pursue the frr option an alternative to the pjm capacity auction if illinois implement the frr option generation illinois nuclear plant could be removed from pjm capacity auction and instead supply capacity and be compensated under the frr program which ha the potential to mitigate the current economic distress being experienced by generation nuclear plant in illinois discussed in note early plant retirement implementing the frr program in illinois will require both legislative and regulatory change whether legislation is needed in new jersey would depend on how the state chooses to structure an frr program exelon can not predict whether or when such legislative and regulatory change can be implemented of contentscombined note to consolidated financial statement dollar in million except per share data unless otherwise noted note regulatory matterson february ferc issued an order rejecting request to expand nyiso version of the mopr referred to buyer side mitigation rule beyond it current limited applicability to certain resource in downstate however on october two natural gas fired generator in new york filed complaint at ferc seeking to expand the mopr in nyiso to apply to all resource new and existing across the entire nyiso market exelon is strenuously opposing expansion of ferc mopr policy in the nyiso market while it is too early in the proceeding to predict it outcome and there are significant difference between the nyiso and pjm market that would justify different result if ferc follows it mopr precedent in pjm and applies the mopr in nyiso broadly requested in the complaint generation facility in nyiso that are receiving zec compensation may be at increased risk of not clearing the capacity auction if generation state supported nuclear plant in pjm or nyiso are subjected to the mopr or equivalent without compensation under an frr or similar program it could have material adverse impact on exelon and generation financial statement which exelon and generation can not reasonably

nuclear unit have been funded with amount collected from the previous owner and their respective utility customer peco is authorized to collect fund in revenue for decommissioning the former peco

deposited into the ndt fund for the unit for which fund are collected every five year peco file rate adjustment with the papuc that reflects peco calculation of the estimated amount needed to decommission each of the former peco unit based on updated fund balance and estimated decommissioning cost the rate adjustment is used to determine the amount collectible from peco customer on march peco filed it nuclear decommissioning cost adjustment with the papuc proposing an annual recovery from customer of approximately million this amount reflects decrease from the previously approved annual collection of approximately million primarily due to the removal of the collection for limerick unit and result of the nrc approving the extension of the operating license for an additional year on august the papuc approved the filing and the new rate became effective january any shortfall of fund necessary for decommissioning determined for each generating station unit is ultimately required to be funded by generation with the exception of shortfall for the current decommissioning activity at zion station where certain decommissioning activity have been transferred to third party see zion station decommissioning below and the ceng unit where any shortfall is required to be funded by both generation and edf generation through peco ha recourse to collect additional amount from peco customer related to shortfall of ndt fund for the former peco unit subject to certain limitation and threshold prescribed by an order from the papuc generally peco and likewise generation will not be allowed to collect amount associated with the first million of any shortfall of trust fund compared to decommissioning cost well of any additional shortfall on an aggregate basis for all former peco unit the initial million and up to of any additional shortfall would be borne by generation no recourse exists to collect additional amount from utility customer for any of generation other nuclear unit with respect to the former comed and peco unit any fund remaining in the ndts after all decommissioning ha been completed are required to be refunded to comed or peco customer subject to certain limitation that allow sharing of excess fund with generation related to the former peco unit with respect to generation other nuclear unit generation retains any fund remaining after decommissioning however in connection with ceng acquisition of the nine mile point and ginna plant and settlement with certain regulatory agency ceng is subject to certain condition pertaining to ndt

including realized and unrealized gain and loss on the ndt fund depreciation of the arc and accretion of the decommissioning obligation are generally offset within exelon and generation consolidated statement of operation and comprehensive income and are recorded by generation and the corresponding regulated utility component of the intercompany and regulatory balance on the balance sheet for the purpose of making this determination the decommissioning obligation referred to is different described below from the calculation used in the nrc minimum funding obligation filing based on nrc guideline for the former peco unit given the symmetric settlement provision that allow for continued recovery of decommissioning cost from peco customer in the event of shortfall and the obligation for generation to ultimately return any excess fund to peco customer on an aggregate basis for all seven unit decommissioning related activity are generally offset within exelon and generation consolidated statement of operation and comprehensive income regardless of whether the ndt fund are expected to exceed or fall short of the total estimated decommissioning obligation the offset of decommissioning related activity within the consolidated statement of operation and comprehensive income result in an equal adjustment to the noncurrent payable or noncurrent receivables to affiliate at generation with peco recording an equal noncurrent affiliate receivable from or payable to generation and corresponding regulatory liability or regulatory asset any change to the existing peco regulatory agreement could impact exelon and generation ability to offset decommissioning related activity within the consolidated statement of operation and comprehensive income and the impact to exelon and generation financial statement could be material for the former comed unit given no further recovery from comed customer is permitted and generation retains an obligation to ultimately return any unused ndts to comed customer on unit by unit basis to the extent the related ndt investment balance are expected to exceed the total estimated decommissioning obligation for each unit the offset of decommissioning related activity within the consolidated statement of operation and comprehensive income result with generation recognizing an intercompany payable to comed while comed record an intercompany receivable from generation with corresponding regulatory liability however given the asymmetric settlement provision that doe not allow for continued recovery from comed customer in the event of shortfall recognition of regulatory asset at comed is not permissible and accounting for decommissioning related activity at generation for that unit would not be offset and the impact to exelon and generation consolidated statement of operation and comprehensive income could be material during such period of december decommissioning related activity for all of the former

requirementsnrc regulation require that licensee of nuclear generating facility demonstrate reasonable assurance that fund will be available in specified minimum amount to decommission the facility at the end of it life the estimated decommissioning obligation calculated using the nrc methodology differ from the aro recorded in generation and exelon consolidated balance sheet primarily due to difference in the type of cost included in the estimate the basis for estimating such cost and assumption regarding the decommissioning alternative to be used potential license renewal decommissioning cost escalation and the growth rate in the ndt fund under nrc regulation if the minimum funding requirement calculated under the nrc methodology are le than the future value of the ndt fund also calculated under the nrc methodology then the nrc requires either further funding or other financial guarantee key assumption used in the minimum funding calculation using the nrc methodology at december include consideration of cost only for the removal of radiological contamination at each unit the option on unit by unit basis to use generic non site specific cost estimate consideration of only one decommissioning scenario for each unit the plant cease operation at the end of their current license life with no assumed license renewal for those unit that have not already received renewal the assumption of current nominal dollar cost estimate that are neither escalated through the anticipated period of decommissioning nor discounted using the carfr and assumed annual after tax return on the ndt fund of for the former peco unit specified by the papuc in contrast the key criterion and assumption used by generation to determine the aro and to forecast the target growth in the ndt fund at december include the use of site specific cost estimate that are updated at least once every five year the inclusion in the aro estimate of all legally unavoidable cost required to decommission the unit radiological decommissioning and full site restoration for certain unit on site spent fuel maintenance and storage subsequent to ceasing operation and until doe acceptance and disposal of certain llrw the consideration of multiple scenario where decommissioning and site restoration activity applicable are completed under possible scenario ranging from to year after the cessation of plant operation the consideration of multiple end of life scenario the measurement of the obligation at the present value of the future estimated cost and an annual average accretion of

the risk inherent in the input to the valuation technique the input and factor include forward commodity price commodity price volatility contractual volume delivery location interest rate credit quality of counterparties and credit enhancement for commodity derivative the primary input to the valuation model is the forward commodity price curve for each instrument forward commodity price curve are derived by risk management for liquid location and by the trader and portfolio manager for illiquid location all location are reviewed and verified by risk management considering published exchange transaction price executed bilateral transaction broker quote and other observable or public data source the relevant forward commodity curve used to value each of the derivative depends on number of factor including commodity type delivery location and delivery period price volatility varies by commodity and location when appropriate generation discount future cash flow using risk free interest rate with adjustment to reflect the credit quality of each counterparty for asset and generation own credit quality for liability the level of observability of forward commodity price varies generally due to the delivery location and delivery period certain delivery location including pjm west hub for power and henry hub for natural gas are more liquid and price are observable for up to three year in the future the observability period of volatility is generally shorter than the underlying power curve used in option valuation the forward curve for le liquid location is estimated by using the forward curve from the liquid location and applying spread to represent the cost to transport the commodity to the delivery location this spread doe not typically represent majority of the instrument market price result the change in fair value is closely tied to liquid market movement and not change in the applied spread the change in fair value associated with change in the spread is generally immaterial an average spread calculated across all level power and gas delivery location is approximately and for power and natural gas respectively many of the commodity derivative are

sheet date would have direct impact on the fair value of the above instrument if they were adjusted the significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of generation commodity derivative are forward commodity price and for option is price volatility increase decrease in the forward commodity price in isolation would result in significantly higher lower fair value for long position contract that give generation the obligation or option to purchase commodity with offsetting impact to short position contract that give generation the obligation or right to sell commodity increase decrease in volatility would increase decrease the value for the holder of the option writer of the option generally change in the estimate of forward commodity price is unrelated to change in the estimate of volatility of price an increase to the reserve listed above would decrease the fair value of the position an increase to the heat rate or renewable factor would increase the fair

to indemnify cotter for any liability arising in connection with the west lake landfill in connection with exelon corporate restructuring this responsibility to indemnify cotter wa transferred to generation including cotter there are three prps participating in the west lake landfill remediation proceeding investigation by generation ha identified number of other party who also may be prps and could be liable to contribute to the final remedy further investigation is ongoing in september the epa issued it record of decision rod amendment for the selection of final remedy the rod amendment modified the remedy previously selected by epa in it rod while the rod of contentscombined note to consolidated financial statement dollar in million except per share data unless otherwise noted note commitment and contingenciesrequired only that the radiological material and other waste at the site be capped the rod amendment requires partial excavation of the radiological material in addition to the previously selected capping remedy the rod amendment also allows for variation in depth of excavation depending on radiological concentration the epa and the prps have entered into consent agreement to perform the remedial design which is expected to be completed by early in march the prps received special notice letter from the epa to perform the remedial action work on october cotter generation indemnitee provided non binding good faith offer to conduct or finance portion of the remedy subject to certain condition the total estimated cost of the remedy taking into account the current epa technical requirement and the total cost expected to be incurred collectively by the prps in fully executing the remedy is approximately million including cost escalation on an undiscounted basis which would be allocated among the final group of prps generation ha determined that loss associated with the epa partial excavation and enhanced landfill cover remedy is probable and ha recorded liability included in the table above that reflects management best estimate of cotter allocable share of the ultimate cost given the joint and several nature of this liability the magnitude of generation ultimate liability will depend on the actual cost incurred to implement the required remedy well on the nature and term of any cost sharing arrangement with the final group of prps therefore it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost and cotter associated allocable share could differ significantly once these uncertainty are resolved which could have material impact on exelon and generation future financial statement one of the other prps ha indicated it will be making contribution claim against cotter for cost that it ha incurred to prevent the subsurface fire from spreading to those area of the west lake landfill where radiological material are believed to have been disposed at this time exelon and generation do not have sufficient information to ass this claim and therefore are unable to estimate range of loss if any such no liability ha been recorded for the potential contribution claim it is reasonably possible however that resolution of this matter could have material unfavorable impact on exelon and generation financial statement in january the prps were advised by the epa that it will begin an additional investigation and evaluation of groundwater condition at the west lake landfill in september the prps agreed to an administrative settlement agreement and order on consent for the performance by the prps of the groundwater remedial investigation ri feasibility study the purpose of this ri is to define the nature and extent of any groundwater contamination from the west lake landfill site and evaluate remedial alternative generation estimate the undiscounted cost for the groundwater ri to be approximately million generation determined loss associated with the ri is probable and ha recorded liability included in the table above that reflects management best estimate of cotter allocable share of the cost among the prps at this time generation can not predict the likelihood that or the extent to which any remediation activity may be required and therefore can not estimate reasonably possible range of loss for response cost beyond those associated with the ri component it is reasonably possible however that resolution of this matter could have material unfavorable impact on exelon and generation future financial statement in august cotter wa notified by the doj that cotter is considered prp with respect to the government clean up cost for contamination attributable to low level radioactive residue at former storage and reprocessing facility named latty avenue near st louis missouri the latty avenue site is included in comed now generation indemnification responsibility discussed above part of the sale of cotter the radioactive residue had been generated initially in connection with the processing of uranium ore part of the government manhattan project cotter purchased the residue in for initial processing at the latty avenue facility for the subsequent extraction of uranium and metal in the nrc found that the latty avenue site had radiation level exceeding nrc criterion for decontamination of land area latty avenue wa investigated and remediated by the united state army corp of engineer pursuant to funding under fusrap pursuant to series of annual agreement since the doj and the prps have tolled the statute of limitation until august so that settlement discussion can proceed on august the doj advised cotter and the other prps that it is seeking approximately million from all the prps and ha directed that the prps must submit good faith joint proposed settlement offer generation ha determined that loss associated with this matter is probable under it indemnification agreement with cotter and ha recorded an estimated liability which is included in the table above benning road site exelon generation phi and pepco in september phi received letter from epa identifying the benning road site one of six land based site potentially contributing to contamination

pepco and pepco energy service to conduct ri for the benning road site and an approximately to acre portion of the adjacent anacostia river since pepco and pepco energy service now generation pursuant to exelon acquisition of phi have been performing ri work and have submitted multiple draft ri report to the doee in september pepco and generation issued draft final ri report which doee approved on february pepco and generation are developing to evaluate possible remedial alternative for submission to doee the court ha established schedule for completion of the and approval by the doee by september after completion and approval of the doee will prepare proposed plan for public comment and then issue rod identifying any further response action determined to be necessary phi pepco and generation have determined that loss associated with this matter is probable and have accrued an estimated liability which is included in the table above anacostia river tidal reach exelon phi and pepco contemporaneous with the benning road site ri being performed by pepco and generation doee and the national park service have been conducting separate ri focused on the entire tidal reach of the anacostia river extending from just north of the maryland district of columbia boundary line to the confluence of the anacostia and potomac river the river wide ri incorporated the result of the river sampling performed by pepco and pepco energy service part of the benning ri well similar sampling effort conducted by owner of other site adjacent to this segment of the river and supplemental river sampling conducted by doee contractor in april doee released draft ri report for public review and comment pepco submitted written comment on the draft ri and participated in public hearing pepco ha determined that it is probable that cost for remediation will be incurred and recorded liability in the third quarter for management best estimate of it share of those cost on september doee released it interim rod the interim rod reflects an adaptive management approach which will require several identified hot spot in the river to be addressed first while continuing to conduct study and to monitor the river to evaluate improvement and determine potential future remediation plan the adaptive management process chosen by doee is le intrusive provides more long term environmental certainty is le costly and allows for site specific remediation plan already underway including the plan for the benning road site to proceed to conclusion pepco ha concluded that incremental exposure remains reasonably possible but management can not reasonably estimate range of loss beyond the amount recorded which are included in the table above in addition to the activity associated with the remedial process outlined above cercla separately requires federal and state including washington natural resource trustee federal or state agency designated by the president or the relevant state respectively or indian tribe to conduct an assessment of any damage to natural resource within their jurisdiction result of the contamination that is being remediated the trustee can seek compensation from responsible party for such damage including restoration cost during the second quarter of pepco became aware that the trustee are in the beginning stage of natural resource damage nrd assessment process that often take many year beyond the remedial decision to complete pepco ha concluded that loss associated with the eventual nrd assessment is reasonably possible due to the very early stage
