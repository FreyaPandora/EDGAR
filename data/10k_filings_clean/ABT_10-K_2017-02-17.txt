rico under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known superfund abbott is also engaged in remediation at several other site some of which are owned by

well application product user establishment and other fee governmental agency can also invalidate intellectual property right compliance with these law and regulation is costly and materially affect abbott business among other effect health care regulation substantially increase the time difficulty and cost incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing

criminal sanction including fine and penalty abbott business can also be affected by ongoing study of the utilization safety efficacy and outcome of health care product and component that are

of their use access to human health care product continues to be subject of investigation and action by governmental agency legislative body and private organization in many country major focus is cost containment effort to reduce health care cost are also made in the private sector notably by health care payors and provider which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measure abbott expects insurer and provider will continue attempt to reduce the cost or utilization of health care product many country control the price of health care product directly or indirectly through reimbursement payment pricing coverage limitation or compulsory licensing budgetary pressure on health care payors may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressure on abbott product for the foreseeable future in the united state the federal government regularly evaluates reimbursement for medical procedure in which medical device and diagnostics may be used the government follows diagnosis related group drg payment system for certain institutional service provided under medicare or medicaid and ha implemented prospective payment system pps for service delivered in hospital outpatient nursing home and home health setting drg and pps entitle health care facility to fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis and or procedure rather actual cost incurred in patient treatment thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditure for many health care product medicare also implemented competitive bidding system for durable medical equipment including diabetes product enteral nutrition product and supply additionally the protecting access to medicare act establishes new payment system for clinical laboratory test which go into effect in in the patient protection and affordable care act amended by the health care and education reconciliation act together the affordable care act imposed an excise tax on abbott and other medical device manufacturer and importer the excise tax wa subsequently suspended from january through december part of the consolidated appropriation act of the excise tax is scheduled to apply to sale of taxable

medicare and medicaid to record any transfer of value to physician and teaching hospital and to report this data to the center for medicare and medicaid service for subsequent public disclosure similar reporting requirement have also been enacted on the state level domestically and an increasing number of government worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar law requiring transparency of interaction with health care professional failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fine and or penalty policy change including potential modification or repeal of all or part of the affordable care act or implementation of new health care legislation could result in significant change to the health care system the regulation of data privacy and security and the protection of the confidentiality of certain patient health information is increasing for example the european union ha enacted stricter data protection law which will take effect in

area governmental cost containment effort also affect abbott nutritional product business in the united state for example under regulation governing the federally funded special supplemental nutrition program for woman infant and child all state must have cost containment program for infant formula result through competitive bidding state obtain rebate from manufacturer of infant formula whose product are used in the program abbott expects debate to continue at all government level worldwide over the marketing manufacture availability method of delivery and payment for health care product and service well data privacy and security abbott belief that future legislation and regulation in the market it serf could affect access to health care product and service increase rebate reduce price or reimbursement or the rate of price increase for health care product and service change health care delivery system create new fee and obligation for the pharmaceutical nutrition diagnostic and medical device industry or require additional reporting and disclosure it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbott or the health care industry in general might be affected by the

competitor may negatively affect abbott result of operation abbott product face intense competition from it competitor product competitor product may be safer more effective more effectively marketed or sold or have lower price or superior performance feature than abbott product abbott can not predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction of competitor product the manufacture of many of abbott product is highly exacting and complex process and if abbott or one of it supplier encounter problem manufacturing product abbott business could suffer the manufacture of many of abbott product is highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirement problem may arise during manufacturing for variety of reason including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocol and procedure problem with raw material natural disaster and environmental factor in addition single supplier are currently used for certain product and material if problem arise during the production of batch of product that batch of product may have to be discarded this could among other thing lead to increased cost lost revenue damage to customer relation time and expense spent investigating the cause and depending on the cause similar loss with respect to other batch or product if problem are not discovered before the product is released to the market recall and product liability cost may also be incurred to the extent abbott or one of it supplier experience significant manufacturing problem this could have material adverse effect on abbott revenue and profitability significant safety concern could arise for abbott product which could have material adverse effect on abbott revenue and financial condition health care product typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trial of limited duration following regulatory approval these product will be used over longer period of time in many patient

required to provide additional warning on product label or narrow it approved intended use either of which could reduce the product market acceptance if serious safety issue arise with an abbott product sale of the product could be halted by abbott or by regulatory authority safety issue affecting supplier or competitor product also may reduce the market acceptance of abbott product in addition in the ordinary course of business abbott is the subject of product liability claim and lawsuit alleging that it product or the product of other company that abbott promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patient product liability claim and lawsuit safety alert or product recall and other allegation of product safety or quality issue regardless of

consolidated gross revenue were subject to various form of rebate and allowance that abbott recorded reduction of revenue at the time of sale most of these rebate and allowance in are in the nutritional product and diabetes care segment abbott provides rebate to state agency that administer the special supplemental nutrition program for woman infant and child wic wholesaler group purchasing organization and other government agency and private entity rebate amount are usually based upon the volume of purchase using contractual or statutory price for product factor used in the rebate calculation include the identification of which product have been sold subject to rebate which customer or government agency price term apply and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of rebate using historical trend adjusted for current change abbott estimate the amount of the rebate that will be paid and record the liability reduction of gross sale when abbott record it sale of the product settlement of the rebate generally occurs from one to six month after sale abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trend and make adjustment to reserve for change in trend and term of rebate program rebate and chargebacks charged against gross sale in and amounted to approximately billion billion and billion respectively or percent percent and percent respectively based on gross sale of approximately billion billion and billion respectively subject to rebate one percentage point increase in the percentage of rebate to related gross sale would decrease net sale by approximately million in abbott considers one percentage point increase to be reasonably likely increase in the percentage of rebate to related gross sale other allowance charged against gross sale were approximately million million and million for cash discount in and respectively and million million and million for return in and respectively cash discount are known within to day of sale and therefore can be reliably estimated return can be reliably estimated because abbott historical return are low and because sale return term and other sale term have remained relatively unchanged for several period management analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balance each quarter in the domestic nutritional business management us both internal and external data available to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel management ha access to several large customer inventory management data and for other customer utilizes data from third party that measure time on the retail shelf these source allow management to make reliable estimate of inventory in the distribution channel except for transition period before or after change in the supplier for the wic business in state inventory in the distribution channel doe not vary substantially management also estimate the state processing lag time based on claim data in the wic business the state where the sale is made which is the determining factor for the applicable price is reliably determinable estimate are required for the amount of wic sale within each state where abbott ha the wic business external data source utilized for that estimate are participant data from the department of agriculture usda which administers the wic program participant data from some of the state and internally administered market research the usda ha been making it data available for many year internal data includes historical redemption rate and pricing data at december abbott had wic business in state historically adjustment to prior year rebate accrual have not been material to net income abbott employ various technique to verify the accuracy of claim submitted to it and where possible work with the organization submitting claim to gain insight into change that might affect the rebate amount for government agency program the calculation of rebate involves interpretation of relevant regulation which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation income tax abbott operates in numerous country where it income tax return are subject to audit and adjustment because abbott operates globally the nature of the audit item is often complex and the objective of the government auditor can result in tax on the same income in more than one country abbott employ internal and external tax professional to minimize audit adjustment amount where possible in accordance with the accounting rule relating to the measurement of tax contingency in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position and the measurement of the benefit is calculated the largest amount that is more than percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit application of these rule requires significant amount of judgment in the abbott federal income tax return through are settled abbott doe not record deferred income tax on earnings reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiary pension and post employment benefit abbott offer pension benefit and post employment health care to many of it employee abbott engages outside actuary to assist in the determination of the obligation and cost under these program abbott must develop long term assumption the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rate discount rate and the expected return on plan asset the discount rate used to measure liability were determined based on high quality fixed income security that match the duration of the expected retiree benefit the health care cost trend rate represent abbott expected annual rate of change in the cost of health care benefit and are forward projection of health care cost of the measurement date difference between the assumed rate and the actual rate which will not be known for year can be significant in relation to the obligation and the annual cost recorded for these program low interest rate have significantly increased actuarial loss for these plan at december pretax net actuarial loss and prior service cost and credit recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for abbott defined benefit plan and medical and dental plan were loss of billion and million respectively actuarial loss and gain are amortized over the remaining service attribution period of the employee under the corridor method in accordance with the rule for accounting for post employment benefit difference between the expected long term return on plan asset and the actual annual return are amortized over five year period note to the consolidated financial statement describes the impact of one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate however there can be no certainty that change would be limited to only one percentage point valuation of intangible asset abbott ha acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible asset that abbott record at fair value at the acquisition date transaction involving the purchase or sale of intangible asset occur with some frequency between company in the health care field and valuation are usually based on discounted cash flow analysis the discounted cash flow model requires assumption about the timing and amount of future net cash flow risk cost of capital terminal value and market participant each of these factor can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset abbott engages independent valuation expert who review abbott critical assumption and calculation for acquisition of significant intangible abbott review definite lived intangible asset for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flow approach if the undiscounted cash flow of an intangible asset are le than the carrying value of an intangible asset the intangible asset is written to it fair value which is usually the discounted cash flow amount where cash flow can not be identified for an individual asset the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flow are identifiable goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset which relate to in process research and development acquired in business combination are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in impairment occurs at december goodwill amounted to billion and intangible amounted to billion excluding approximately billion of goodwill and million of intangible in non current asset held for disposition due to the pending sale of amo amortization expense in continuing operation for intangible asset amounted to million in million in and million in there were no impairment of goodwill in or litigation abbott account for litigation loss in accordance with fasb accounting standard codification no contingency under asc no loss contingency provision are recorded for probable loss at management best estimate of loss or when best estimate can not be made minimum loss contingency amount is recorded these estimate are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known and the estimate are refined each accounting period additional information becomes known accordingly abbott is often initially unable to develop best estimate of loss and therefore the minimum amount which could be zero is recorded information becomes known either the minimum loss amount is increased resulting in additional loss provision or best estimate can be made also resulting in additional loss provision occasionally best estimate amount is changed to lower amount when event result in an expectation of more favorable outcome than previously expected abbott estimate the range of possible loss to be from approximately million to million for it legal proceeding and environmental exposure accrual of approximately million have been recorded at december for these proceeding and exposure these accrual represent management best estimate of probable loss defined by fasb asc no contingency result of

the segment existing product to provide benefit to patient and customer established pharmaceutical doe not actively pursue primary research development usually begin with work on existing product or after the acquisition of an advanced stage licensing opportunity depending upon the product the phase of development may include drug product development phase bioequivalence study to compare future established pharmaceutical brand with an already marketed compound with the same active pharmaceutical ingredient api phase ii study to test the efficacy of benefit in small group of patient phase iii study to broaden the testing to wider population that reflects the actual medical use phase iv and other post marketing study to obtain new clinical use data on existing product within approved indication the specific requirement scope of clinical trial for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different country and geographic region the process may range from one year for bioequivalence study project to or more year for complex formulation new indication or geographic expansion in specific country such china in the diagnostics segment the phase of the research and development process include discovery which focus on identification of product that will address specific therapeutic area platform or unmet clinical need concept feasibility during which the material and manufacturing process are evaluated testing may include product characterization and analysis is performed to confirm clinical utility development during which extensive testing is performed to demonstrate that the product meet specified design requirement and that the design specification conform to user need and intended us the regulatory requirement for diagnostic product vary across different country and geographic region in the the fda classifies diagnostic product into class ii or iii and the classification determines the regulatory process for approval while the diagnostics segment ha product in all three class the vast majority of it product are categorized class or class ii submission of separate regulatory filing is not required for class product class ii device typically require pre market notification to the fda through regulatory filing known submission most class iii product are subject to the fda pre marketing approval pma requirement other class iii product such those used to screen blood require the submission and approval of biological license application bla in the eu diagnostic product are also categorized into different category and the regulatory process which is governed by the european invitro diagnostic medical device directive depends upon the category certain product category require review and approval by an independent company known notified body before the manufacturer can affix ce mark to the product to show compliance with the directive other product only require self certification process in the vascular segment the research and development process begin with research on specific technology that is evaluated for feasibility and commercial viability if the research program pass that hurdle it move forward into development the development process includes evaluation and selection of product design completion of clinical trial to test the product safety and efficacy and validation of the manufacturing process to demonstrate it repeatability and ability to consistently meet pre determined specification similar to the diagnostic product discussed above in the vascular product are classified class ii or iii most of abbott vascular product are classified class ii device that follow the regulatory process or class iii device that are subject to the pma process in the eu vascular product are also categorized into different class and the regulatory process which is governed by the european medical device directive varies by class each product must bear ce mark to show compliance with the directive some product require submission of design dossier to the appropriate regulatory authority for review and approval prior to ce marking of the device for other product the company is required to prepare technical file which includes testing result and clinical evaluation but can self certify it ability to apply the ce mark to the product outside the and the eu the regulatory requirement vary across different country and region after approval and commercial launch of some vascular product post market trial may be conducted either due to conditional requirement of the regulatory market approval or with the
