november the agreement and our obligation to pay royalty to japan tobacco will terminate on product by product basis patent providing exclusivity for the product expire or if later on the tenth anniversary of commercial launch for such product we may terminate the agreement for any reason in which case the license granted by japan tobacco to would terminate either party may terminate the agreement in response to material breach by the other party research collaborationswe have number of collaboration with partner for the research and development of certain compound and drug candidate none of our research collaboration are significant to from financial statement perspective research and developmentour philosophy and strategy are to develop best in class drug that improve safety or

of medical condition including hiv aid liver disease hematology oncology and inflammation respiratory disease we have research scientist primarily in foster city and santa monica california seattle washington and alberta canada engaged in the discovery and development of new molecule and technology that we hope will lead to the approval of new medicine that will advance the current standard of care and address unmet medical need development of our product candidate is subject to various risk and uncertainty these risk and uncertainty include our ability to enroll patient in clinical trial the possibility of unfavorable result of our clinical trial the need to modify or delay our clinical trial or to perform additional trial and the risk of failing to obtain regulatory approval result

court of justice for the european union the composition of matter patent ha expired in the european union in the european union and the united state patent application are pending relating to kite proprietary manufacturing process application for patent term extension are pending in the united state and or spcs are pending in one or more country in the european union for these product an application for patent term extension wa filed in the united state that if granted would extend the expiration date to application for spcs were filed in the european union that if granted would extend the expiration date to protection and certain challengespatents and other proprietary right are important to our business if we have properly drafted and enforceable patent it can be more difficult for our competitor to use our technology to create competitive product and more difficult for our competitor to obtain patent that prevents from using technology we create part of our business strategy we actively seek patent protection both in the united state and internationally and file additional patent application when appropriate to cover improvement in our compound product and technology patent covering certain of the active pharmaceutical ingredient api of most of our hiv product well yescarta letairis and ranexa are held by third party we acquired exclusive right to these patent in the agreement we have with these party we do not own patent covering ranolazine the active ingredient of ranexa instead when it wa discovered that only sustained release formulation of ranolazine would achieve therapeutic plasma level we obtained patent on those formulation and the characteristic plasma level they achieve for yescarta the composition of matter patent ha expired in the european union in the european union and the united state patent application are pending related to kite proprietary manufacturing process we may obtain patent for certain product many year marketing approval is obtained for those product because patent have limited life which may begin to run prior to the commercial sale of the related product the commercial value of the patent may be limited however we may be able to apply for patent term extension or supplementary protection certificate in some country for example extension for the patent or supplementary protection certificate on many of our product have been granted in the united state and in number of european country compensating in part for delay in obtaining marketing approval similar patent term extension may be available for other product that we are developing but we can not be certain we will obtain them in some country it is also important that we do not infringe the valid patent of third party if we infringe the valid patent of third party we may be required to pay significant monetary damage or we may be prevented from commercializing product or may be required to obtain license from these third party we may not be able to obtain alternative technology or any required license on reasonable term or at all if we fail to obtain these license or alternative technology we may be unable to develop or commercialize some or all of our product for example we are aware of patent and patent application owned by other party that such party may claim to cover the use of sofosbuvir axicabtagene ciloleucel and bictegravir because patent application are confidential for period of time patent is issued we may not know if our competitor have filed patent application for technology covered by our pending application or if we were the first to invent or first to file an application directed toward the technology that is the subject of our patent application competitor may have filed patent application or received patent and may obtain additional patent and proprietary right that block or compete with our product in addition if competitor file patent application covering our technology we may have to participate in interference derivation proceeding or litigation to determine the right to patent litigation and interference derivation proceeding are unpredictable and expensive such that even if we are ultimately successful our result of operation may be adversely affected by such event patent relating to pharmaceutical biopharmaceutical and biotechnology product compound and process such those that cover our existing compound product and process and those that we will likely file in the future do not always provide complete or adequate protection future litigation or other proceeding regarding the enforcement or validity of our existing patent or any future patent could result in the invalidation of our patent or substantially reduce their protection from time to time certain individual or entity may challenge our patent our pending patent application and the patent application filed by our collaborative partner may not result in the issuance of any patent or may result in patent that do not provide adequate protection result we may not be able to prevent third party from developing compound or product that are closely related to those which we have developed or are developing in addition certain country do not provide effective enforcement of our patent and third party manufacturer may be able to sell generic version of our product in those country for description of our significant pending legal proceeding please see note commitment and contingency legal proceeding of the note to consolidated financial statement included in part ii item of this annual report on form trade secretswe also rely on unpatented trade secret and improvement unpatented internal know and technological innovation for example great deal of our liposomal manufacturing expertise which is key component of our liposomal technology is not covered by patent but is instead protected trade secret we protect these right mainly through confidentiality agreement with our corporate partner employee consultant and vendor these agreement provide that all confidential information developed or made known to an individual during the course of their relationship with will be kept confidential and will not be used or disclosed to third party except in specified circumstance in the case of employee the agreement provide that all invention made by an individual employed by will be our exclusive property we can not be certain that these party will comply with these confidentiality agreement that we have adequate remedy for any breach or that our trade secret will not become known or be independently discovered by our competitor under some of our agreement invention become jointly owned by and our corporate partner and in other case become the exclusive property of one party in certain circumstance it can be difficult to determine who owns particular invention and dispute could arise regarding those invention if our trade secret or confidential information become known or independently discovered by competitor or if we enter into dispute over ownership of invention our business and result of operation could be adversely affected manufacturing and raw materialsour product are either manufactured at our own facility or by third party manufacturer or corporate partner we depend on third party to manufacture the majority of our api and solid dose product we also rely on our corporate partner to manufacture certain of our product additionally we own or lease manufacturing facility in foster city san dimas la verne oceanside and el segundo california edmonton alberta canada and cork ireland where we manufacture certain product and api for clinical and or commercial us manufacturing of our productswe contract with third party to manufacture certain api for clinical and commercial purpose including vosevi epclusa harvoni sovaldi truvada atripla stribild complera eviplera viread genvoya odefsey descovy biktarvy vemlidy emtriva tybost ranexa ambisome zydelig and cayston we generally use multiple third party contract manufacturer to manufacture the api in our product we are the exclusive manufacturer of ambrisentan the api of letairis although another supplier is qualified to make this api we also rely on third party contract manufacturer to manufacture our oral liquid tablet and capsule product for example we use multiple third party contract manufacturer to manufacture epclusa harvoni sovaldi truvada atripla stribild complera eviplera viread genvoya odefsey descovy biktarvy vemlidy and ranexa emtriva vosevi tybost letairis zydelig and hepsera are also completed by third party contract manufacturer in addition we rely on third party contract manufacturer to manufacture our aseptic product such ambisome and cayston we have established clinical and commercial manufacturing facility for the cell processing activity of yescarta yescarta car cell therapy involves harvesting cell from the patient blood ii engineering cell to express cancer specific receptor iii increasing the number of engineered cell and iv infusing the functional cancer specific cell back into the patient for our future product we continue to develop additional manufacturing capability and establish additional third party supplier to manufacture sufficient quantity of our product candidate to undertake clinical trial and to manufacture sufficient quantity of any product that is approved for commercial sale our manufacturing facilitiesat our foster city california facility we conduct process chemistry research and development activity manufacture api for our clinical trial and oversee our third party contract manufacturer at our san dimas california and la verne california facility we manufacture ambisome in san dimas package and label the majority of our commercial product and distribute our product to the america and pacific rim we utilize our oceanside california facility for the clinical manufacture and process development of biologics candidate in preclinical phase and phase testing we utilize our el segundo california facility for the clinical and commercial manufacture and processing of yescarta on patient by patient basis we utilize our cork ireland facility for the commercial manufacture packaging and labeling of our antiviral product we also perform quality control testing labeling packaging and final release of many of our product for distribution to the european union and other international market at our edmonton alberta facility in canada we carry out process research and scale up of our clinical development candidate manufacture api for both investigational and commercial product and conduct chemical development activity to improve existing commercial manufacturing process third party manufacturersour third party manufacturer and corporate partner are independent entity who are subject to their own unique operational and financial risk which are out of our control if we or any of these third party manufacturer or corporate partner fail to perform required this could impair our ability to deliver our product on timely basis or receive royalty or cause delay in our clinical trial and application for regulatory approval further we may have to write the cost of manufacturing any batch that fails pas quality inspection or meet regulatory approval to the extent these risk materialize and affect their performance obligation to our financial result may be adversely affected in addition we our third party manufacturer and our corporate partner may only be able to produce some of our product at one or limited number of facility and therefore have limited manufacturing capacity for certain product we believe the technology we use to manufacture our product is proprietary for product manufactured by our third party contract manufacturer we have disclosed all necessary aspect of this technology to enable them to manufacture the product for we have agreement with these third party manufacturer that are intended to restrict these manufacturer from using or revealing this technology but we can not be certain that these third party manufacturer will comply with these restriction in addition these third party manufacturer could develop their own technology related to the work they perform for that we may need to manufacture our product we could be required to enter into additional agreement with these third party manufacturer if we want to use that technology or allow another manufacturer to use that technology the third party manufacturer could refuse to allow to use their technology or could demand term to use their technology that are not acceptable to regulation of manufacturing processthe manufacturing process for pharmaceutical product is highly regulated and regulator may shut manufacturing facility that they believe do not comply with regulation we our third party manufacturer and our corporate partner are subject to current good manufacturing practice which are extensive regulation governing manufacturing process stability testing record keeping and quality standard defined by fda and ema similar regulation are in effect in other jurisdiction our manufacturing operation are subject to routine inspection by regulatory agency if we are unable to remedy the deficiency cited by fda in these inspection our currently marketed product and the timing of regulatory approval of product in development could be adversely affected further there is risk that regulatory agency in other country where marketing application are pending will undertake similar additional review or apply heightened standard of review which could delay the regulatory approval for product in those country for yescarta we are required by fda to comply with the risk evaluation and mitigation strategy program which includes educating and certifying medical personnel regarding the therapy procedure and the potential side effect profile of our therapy such the potential adverse side effect related to cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxicity additionally we are required to maintain complex chain of identity and custody with respect to patient material such material move to the manufacturing facility through the manufacturing process and back to the patient access to supply and materialswe need access to certain supply and product to conduct our clinical trial and manufacture our product if we are unable to purchase sufficient quantity of these material or find suitable alternate material in timely manner our development effort for our product candidate may be delayed or our ability to manufacture our product would be limited which would limit our ability to generate revenue for example significant portion of the raw material and intermediate used to manufacture our antiviral product are supplied by third party manufacturer and corporate partner outside of the united state result any political or economic factor in specific country or region including any change in or interpretation of trade regulation compliance requirement or tax legislation that would limit or prevent third party outside of the united state from supplying these material would adversely affect our ability to manufacture and supply our antiviral product to meet market need and have material and adverse effect on our operating result seasonal operation and backlogour worldwide product sale do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality for the most part we operate in market characterized by short lead time and the absence of significant backlog we do not believe that backlog information is material to our business whole government regulationour operation and activity are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government authority in the united state and other country in the united state the european union and other country drug are subject to rigorous regulation federal and state statute and regulation govern the testing manufacture safety efficacy labeling storage record keeping approval advertising and promotion of our product result of these regulation product development and product approval process are very expensive and time consuming the regulatory requirement applicable to drug development and approval are subject to change any legal and regulatory change may impact our operation in the future country regulatory agency such fda in the united state and ema european commission for the european union must approve drug before it can be sold in the respective country or country the general process for drug approval in the state is summarized below many other country including country in the european union have similar regulatory structure preclinical testingbefore we can test drug candidate in human we must study the drug in laboratory experiment and in animal to generate data to support the drug candidate potential benefit and safety we submit this data to fda in an investigational new drug ind application seeking it approval to test the compound in human clinical trialsif fda accepts the ind the drug candidate can then be studied in human clinical trial to determine if the drug candidate is safe and effective these clinical trial involve three separate phase that often overlap can take many year and are very expensive these three phase which are subject to considerable regulation are follows phase the drug candidate is given to small number of healthy human control subject or patient suffering from the indicated disease to test for safety dose tolerance pharmacokinetics metabolism distribution and excretion phase the drug candidate is given to limited patient population to determine the effect of the drug candidate in treating the disease the best dose of the drug candidate and the possible side effect and safety risk of the drug candidate it is not uncommon for drug candidate that appears promising in phase clinical trial to fail in the more rigorous phase clinical trial phase if drug candidate appears to be effective and safe in phase clinical trial phase clinical trial are commenced to confirm those result phase clinical trial are conducted over longer term involve significantly larger population are conducted at numerous site in different geographic region and are carefully designed to provide reliable and conclusive data regarding the safety and benefit of drug candidate it is not uncommon for drug candidate that appears promising in phase clinical trial to fail in the more rigorous and extensive phase clinical trial fda approval processwhen we believe that the data from our clinical trial show an acceptable benefit risk profile we submit the appropriate filing usually in the form of an nda or supplemental nda with fda seeking approval to sell the drug candidate for particular use fda may hold public hearing where an independent advisory committee of expert advisor asks additional question and make recommendation regarding the drug candidate this committee make recommendation to fda that is not binding but is generally followed by fda if fda agrees that the compound ha met the required level of safety and efficacy for particular use it will allow to sell the drug candidate in the united state for that use it is not unusual however for fda to reject an application because it belief that the drug candidate is not safe enough or efficacious enough or because it not believe that the data submitted is reliable or conclusive at any point in this process the development of drug candidate can be stopped for number of reason including safety concern and lack of treatment benefit we can not be certain that any clinical trial that we are currently conducting or any that we conduct in the future will be completed successfully or within any specified time period we may choose or fda may require to delay or suspend our clinical trial at any time if it appears that the patient are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or if the drug candidate doe not appear to have sufficient treatment benefit fda may also require phase non registrational study to explore scientific question to further characterize safety and efficacy during commercial use of our drug fda may also require to provide additional data or information improve our manufacturing process procedure or facility or may require extensive surveillance to monitor the safety or benefit of our product candidate if it determines that our filing doe not contain adequate evidence of the safety and benefit of the drug in addition even if fda approves drug it could limit the us of the drug fda can withdraw approval if it doe not believe that we are complying with regulatory standard or if problem are uncovered or occur after approval in addition to obtaining fda approval for each drug we obtain fda approval of the manufacturing facility for any drug we sell including those of company who manufacture our drug for all of these facility are subject to periodic inspection by fda fda must also approve foreign establishment that manufacture product to be sold in the united state and these facility are subject to periodic regulatory inspection our manufacturing facility located in california including our el segundo la verne oceanside and san dimas facility also must be licensed by the state of california in compliance with local regulatory requirement our edmonton alberta manufacturing facility in canada and our facility located near dublin and in cork ireland also must obtain local license and permit in compliance with local regulatory requirement drug that treat serious or life threatening disease and condition that are not adequately addressed by existing drug and for which the development program is designed to address the unmet medical need may be designated fast track candidate by and may be eligible for priority review drug for the treatment of hiv infection that are designated for use under the president emergency plan for aid relief may also qualify for an expedited or priority review rest of worlddrugs are also subject to extensive regulation outside of the united state in the european union there is centralized approval procedure that authorizes marketing of product in all country of the european union which includes most major country in europe if this centralized approval procedure is not used approval in one country of the european union can be used to obtain approval in another country of the european union under one of two simplified application process the mutual recognition procedure or the decentralized procedure both of which rely on the principle of mutual recognition after receiving regulatory approval through any of the european registration procedure separate pricing and reimbursement approval are also required in most country the european union also ha requirement for approval of manufacturing facility for all product that are approved for sale by the european regulatory authority pricing and reimbursementsuccessful commercialization of our product depends in part on the availability of governmental and third party payer reimbursement for the cost of such product and related treatment in the market where we sell our product government health authority private health insurer and other organization generally provide reimbursement in the united state the european union and other significant or potentially significant market for our product and product candidate government authority and third party payer are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical product and service significant portion of our sale of the majority of our product are subject to substantial discount from list price in addition the non retail sector in the united state which includes government institution including state adaps the department of veteran affair correctional facility and large health maintenance organization tends to be even le consistent in term of buying pattern and often cause quarter over quarter fluctuation that do not necessarily mirror patient demand for our product federal and state budget pressure including sequestration well the annual grant cycle for federal and state fund may cause purchasing pattern to not reflect patient demand of our product for example in the first quarter of certain prior year we observed large non retail purchase of our hiv product by number of state adaps that exceeded patient demand we believe such purchase were driven by the grant cycle for federal adap fund we expect to continue to experience fluctuation in the purchasing pattern of our non retail customer which may result in fluctuation in our product sale revenue and earnings in the future in light of the budget crisis faced by many european country we have observed variation in purchasing pattern induced by cost containment measure in europe we believe these measure have caused some government agency and other purchaser to reduce inventory of our product in the distribution channel which ha decreased our revenue and caused fluctuation in our product sale and earnings we may continue to see this trend in the future our product mature private insurer and government payer often reduce the amount they will reimburse patient which increase pressure on to reduce price further new branded or generic product are introduced into major market our ability to maintain pricing and market share may be affected for example tdf one of the active pharmaceutical ingredient in stribild complera eviplera atripla and truvada and the main active pharmaceutical ingredient in viread face generic competition in the european union the united state and certain other country in addition because emtricitabine the other active pharmaceutical ingredient of truvada face generic competition in the european union truvada also face generic competition in the european union and certain other country outside of the united state this ha had negative impact on our business and result of operation see also our item risk factor substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sale of product to treat hiv and hcv if we are unable to increase hiv sale or if hcv sale decrease more than anticipated then our result of operation may be adversely affected patient assistance programsrecently there ha been enhanced scrutiny of company sponsored patient assistance program including insurance premium and co pay assistance program and donation to third party charity that provide such assistance there ha also been enhanced scrutiny by government on reimbursement support offering clinical education program and promotional speaker program if we or our agent vendor or donation recipient are deemed to have failed to comply with law regulation or government guidance in any of these area we could be subject to criminal and civil sanction any similar violation by our competitor could also negatively impact our industry reputation and increase scrutiny over our business and our product see also our item risk factor law and regulation applicable to the health care industry could impose new obligation on require to change our business practice and restrict our operation in the future state healthcare reformlegislative and regulatory change to government prescription drug procurement and reimbursement program occur relatively frequently in the united state and foreign jurisdiction in the united state we along with other pharmaceutical manufacturer of branded drug product are required to pay portion of an industry fee also known the branded prescription drug bpd fee calculated based on select government sale during the year percentage of total industry government sale the amount of the annual bpd fee imposed on the pharmaceutical industry whole is billion in and billion in and thereafter our bpd fee expense were million in million in and million in the bpd fee is not tax deductible since the november election president trump and the congress have made numerous effort to repeal or amend the affordable care act in whole or in part in may the house of representative voted to pas the american health care act the ahca which would repeal many provision of the affordable care act although the senate considered but failed to pas the ahca and other comparable measure the congress may consider further legislation to repeal or replace element of the affordable care act in addition the tax cut and job act which president trump signed into law in december repeal the affordable care act individual health insurance mandate which is considered key component of the affordable care act the future stability of the affordable care act and the resulting impact on our business is thus uncertain and could be material in addition many state have proposed legislation that seek to indirectly or directly regulate pharmaceutical drug pricing by requiring biopharmaceutical manufacturer to publicly report proprietary pricing information or to place maximum price ceiling on pharmaceutical product purchased by state agency if such proposed legislation is passed we may experience additional pricing pressure on our product for example in october california governor signed prescription drug price transparency state bill into law requiring prescription drug manufacturer to provide advance notice and explanation for price increase of certain drug that exceed specified threshold similar bill have been previously introduced at the federal level and we expect that additional legislation may be introduced this year the potential effect of health insurance market destabilization during ongoing repeal and replace discussion well the impact of potential change to the way the medicaid program is financed will likely affect patient source of insurance and resultant drug coverage discussion continue at the federal level regarding policy that would either allow or require the government to directly negotiate drug price with pharmaceutical manufacturer for medicare patient require manufacturer to pay higher rebate in medicare part give state more flexibility on drug that are covered under the medicaid program and other policy proposal that could impact reimbursement for our product other discussion have centered on legislation that would permit the re importation of prescription medication from canada or other country it is difficult to predict the impact if any of any such legislation executive action or medicaid flexibility on the use and reimbursement of our product in the united state including the potential for the importation of generic version of our product further yescarta is administered on an in patient basis it is possible that federal government reimbursement through program like medicare and medicaid will be insufficient to cover the complete cost associated with the therapy this could impact the willingness of some hospital to offer the therapy and doctor to recommend the therapy and could lessen the attractiveness of our therapy to patient which could have an adverse effect on sale of yescarta and our result of operation in addition state medicaid program could request additional supplemental rebate on our product result of the increase in the federal base medicaid rebate private insurer could also use the enactment of these increased rebate to exert pricing pressure on our product and to the extent that private insurer or managed care program follow medicaid coverage and payment development the adverse effect may be magnified by private insurer adopting lower payment schedule health care fraud and abuse law and anti bribery lawswe are subject to various federal and state law pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including anti kickback law and false claim law anti kickback law make it illegal for prescription drug manufacturer to solicit offer receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of business including the purchase or prescription of particular drug due to the breadth of the statutory provision and the increasing attention being given to them by law enforcement authority it is possible that certain of our practice may be challenged under anti kickback or similar law false claim law generally prohibit anyone from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claim for payment by federal and certain state payer including medicare and medicaid or knowingly making using or causing to be made or used false record or statement material to false or fraudulent claim our sale marketing patient support and medical activity may be subject to scrutiny under these law in addition the foreign corrupt practice act and similar worldwide anti bribery law generally prohibit company and their intermediary from making improper payment for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policy mandate compliance with these anti bribery law we operate in part of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree in certain circumstance strict compliance with anti bribery law may conflict with local custom and practice or may require to interact with doctor and hospital some of which may be state controlled in manner that is different than local custom despite our training and compliance program our internal control policy and procedure may not protect from reckless or criminal act committed by our employee or agent violation of fraud and abuse law or anti bribery law may be punishable criminal and or civil sanction including fine and civil monetary penalty well the possibility of exclusion from federal health care program including medicare and medicaid violation can also lead to the imposition of corporate integrity agreement or similar government oversight program if the government were to allege against or convict of violating these law there could be disruption on our business and material adverse effect on our result of operation compulsory licensesin number of developing country government official and other interested group have suggested that pharmaceutical company should make drug for hiv or hcv infection available at low cost alternatively government in those developing country could require that we grant compulsory license to allow competitor to manufacture and sell their own version of our product thereby reducing our product sale for example there is growing attention on the availability of hcv therapy and some activist are advocating for the increased availability of hcv therapy through other mean including compulsory license the government of malaysia ha exercised government right under section of the malaysian patent act to practice the patented invention of sofosbuvir for period of three year for use only in government hospital and clinic we are challenging the malaysian government action in the past certain office of the government of brazil have expressed concern over the affordability of our hiv product and declared that they were considering issuing compulsory license to permit the manufacture of otherwise patented product for hiv infection including viread if compulsory license permit generic manufacturing to override our product patent for our hiv hcv or other product or if we are required to grant compulsory license for these product it could reduce our earnings and cash flow and harm our business in addition certain country do not permit enforcement of our patent or permit our patent to issue and third party manufacturer are able to sell generic version of our product in those country for example in the brazilian health regulatory agency rejected our patent application related to sofosbuvir and our hcv product we successfully appealed those decision and those application are now under examination at the brazilian patent and trademark office sale of generic version of our product could significantly reduce our sale and adversely affect our result of operation particularly if generic version of our product are imported into territory where we have existing commercial sale employeesas of january we had approximately employee we believe we have good relation with our employee environment health and safetywe strive to reduce our environmental footprint and implement sustainable business process and practice we incorporate sustainability throughout the development and distribution of our medicine from the safety and regulatory compliance of our product to the regular efficiency improvement we make to our manufacturing process the operation surrounding our product portfolio are routinely evaluated for new and innovative way to further incorporate social and environmental responsibility our practice include ethical sourcing of material green chemistry practice solvent recycling and continued improvement to the sustainability and efficiency of the api and product development process gilead site around the world identify opportunity to reduce natural resource usage through water conservation sustainable building practice energy conservation recycling and diversion from landfill and alternative transportation we continue to look for way to minimize our impact on the environment some factor that contribute to our environmental impact include greenhouse gas emission produced by employee commute the energy and water consumed by our facility and the use of hazardous material such chemical virus and radioactive compound in our facility please refer to our year in review found on our website at www gilead com under responsibility for some of the measure we have taken to mitigate the environmental impact from our business we are subject to number of law and regulation that require compliance with federal state and local regulation regarding workplace safety and protection of the environment we anticipate additional regulation in the near future law and regulation are implemented and under consideration to mitigate the effect of climate change mainly caused by greenhouse gas emission our business is not energy intensive therefore we do not anticipate being subject to cap and trade system or other mitigation measure that would materially impact our capital expenditure operation or competitive position based on current information and subject to the finalization of proposed regulation we believe that our primary risk related to climate change is increased energy cost other informationwe are subject to the information requirement of the exchange act therefore we file periodic report proxy statement and other information with the sec such report proxy statement and other information may be obtained by visiting the public reference room of the sec at street ne washington or by calling the sec at sec by sending an electronic message to the sec at publicinfo sec gov or by sending fax to the sec at in addition the sec maintains website www sec gov that contains report proxy and information statement and other information regarding issuer that file electronically mailing address of our headquarters is lakeside drive foster city california and our telephone number at that location is our website is www gilead com through link on the investor section of our website under sec filing section we make available the following filing soon reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the sec our annual report on form quarterly report on form current report on form and any amendment to those report filed or furnished pursuant to section or of the exchange act all such filing are available free of charge upon request transaction with iranwe not have any transaction with iran during that would require disclosure in this annual report on form item risk factor in evaluating our business you should carefully consider the following risk in addition to the other information in this annual report on form manifestation of any of the following risk could materially and adversely affect our business result of operation and financial condition we note these factor for investor permitted by the private security litigation reform act of it is not possible to predict or identify all such factor and therefore you should not consider the following risk to be complete statement of all the potential risk or uncertainty that we face substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sale of product to treat hiv and hcv if we are unable to increase hiv sale or if hcv sale decrease more than anticipated then our result of operation may be adversely affected we receive substantial portion of our revenue from sale of our product for the treatment of hiv infection which include genvoya truvada atripla descovy stribild odefsey and complera eviplera during the year ended december sale of our hiv product accounted for approximately of our total product sale and we expect our hiv product to account for higher percentage of our total product sale in most of our hiv product contain tenofovir alafenamide taf tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tdf and or emtricitabine which belong to the nucleoside class of antiviral therapeutic if the treatment paradigm for hiv change causing nucleoside based therapeutic to fall out of favor or if we are unable to maintain or increase our hiv product sale our result of operation would likely suffer and we would likely need to scale back our operation including our spending on research and development effort during the year ended december sale of harvoni epclusa sovaldi and vosevi for the treatment of hcv accounted for approximately of our total product sale the primary driver of our hcv product revenue are patient start net pricing and market share since the second quarter of the number of new patient start ha diminished and we expect patient start to continue to decline relative to in all major market resulting in decrease in our hcv product sale our hcv revenue have declined and are expected to further decline result of increased competition from new hcv product which ha further eroded net pricing and market share we anticipate that this impact on pricing and market share will be more fully reflected in mid our hcv product sale could also be further impacted by larger than anticipated shift in our payer mix to more highly discounted payer segment and geographic region in addition future sale of our hcv product may be difficult to estimate because demand depends in part on the extent of reimbursement of our hcv product by private and government payer we may continue to experience global pricing pressure which could result in larger discount or rebate on our product or delayed reimbursement which negatively impact our product sale and result of operation also private and public payer can choose to exclude our hcv product from their formulary coverage list or limit the type of patient for whom coverage will be provided which would negatively impact the demand for and revenue of our hcv product any change in the formulary coverage reimbursement level or discount or rebate offered on our hcv product to payer may impact our anticipated revenue we expect pricing pressure in the hcv market to continue if we are unable to achieve our forecasted hcv sale our stock price could experience significant volatility we may be unable to sustain or increase sale of our hiv or hcv product for any number of reason including but not limited to the reason discussed and the following our hiv and hcv product are used over longer period of time in many patient and in combination with other product and additional study are conducted new issue with respect to safety resistance and interaction with other drug may arise which could cause to provide additional warning or contraindication on our label narrow our approved indication or halt sale of product each of which could reduce our revenue our product mature private insurer and government payer often reduce the amount they will reimburse patient for these product which increase pressure on to reduce price if physician do not see the benefit of our hiv or hcv product the sale of our hiv or hcv product will be limited new branded or generic product are introduced into major market our ability to maintain pricing and market share may be affected for example tdf one of the active pharmaceutical ingredient in stribild complera eviplera and truvada and the main active pharmaceutical ingredient in viread face generic competition in the european union the united state and certain other country in addition because emtricitabine the other active pharmaceutical ingredient of truvada face generic competition in the european union truvada face generic competition in the european union and certain other country outside of the united state this ha had and is expected to continue to have negative impact on our business and result of operation if we fail to commercialize new product or expand the indication for existing product our prospect for future revenue may be adversely affected if we do not introduce new product or increase sale of our existing product we will not be able to increase or maintain our total revenue continue to expand our effort drug development is inherently risky and many product candidate fail during the drug development process for example during we terminated our phase study of for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and cystic fibrosis and our phase study of for the treatment of hepatitis virus in addition we may decide to terminate product development after expending significant resource and effort in addition if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for product candidate from our recent acquisition of kite pharma inc kite and effectively commercialize kite product candidate we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefit from our acquisition of kite including any expected future revenue from kite product candidate we have filed our marketing authorization application maa in the european union for the approval of once daily single tablet regimen containing bictegravir mg and emtricitabine tenofovir alafenamide mg for the treatment of hiv infection in adult we have also filed maa in the european union for the approval of axicabtagene ciloleucel for the treatment of relapsed refractory diffuse large cell lymphoma transformed follicular lymphoma and primary mediastinal cell lymphoma these and any future marketing application we file may not be approved by the regulatory authority on timely basis or at all even if marketing approval is granted for these product there may be significant limitation on their use further we may be unable to file our marketing application for new product our inability to accurately predict demand for our product uptake of new product or fluctuation in customer inventory make it difficult for to accurately forecast sale and may cause our forecasted revenue and earnings to fluctuate which could adversely affect our financial result and our stock price we may be unable to accurately predict demand for our product including the uptake of new product demand is dependent on number of factor for example the non retail sector in the united state which includes government institution including state aid drug assistance program adaps the department of veteran affair correctional facility and large health maintenance organization tends to be even le consistent in term of buying pattern and often cause quarter over quarter fluctuation that do not necessarily mirror patient demand for our product federal and state budget pressure well the annual grant cycle for federal and state fund may cause purchasing pattern to not reflect patient demand of our product for example in the first quarter of certain prior year we observed large non retail purchase of our hiv product by number of state adaps that exceeded patient demand we believe such purchase were driven by the grant cycle for federal adap fund we expect to continue to experience fluctuation in the purchasing pattern of our non retail customer which may result in fluctuation in our product sale revenue and earnings in the future in light of the budget crisis faced by many european country we have observed variation in purchasing pattern induced by cost containment measure in europe we believe these measure have caused some government agency and other purchaser to reduce inventory of our product in the distribution channel which ha decreased our revenue and caused fluctuation in our product sale and earnings we may continue to see this trend in the future during the year ended december approximately of our product sale in the united state were to three wholesaler mckesson corp amerisourcebergen corp and cardinal health inc the wholesaler with whom we have entered into inventory management agreement make estimate to determine end user demand and may not be completely effective in matching their inventory level to actual end user demand result change in inventory level held by those wholesaler can cause our operating result to fluctuate unexpectedly if our sale to these wholesaler do not match end user demand in addition inventory is held at retail pharmacy and other non wholesaler location with whom we have no inventory management agreement and no control over buying pattern adverse change in economic condition increased competition or other factor may cause retail pharmacy to reduce their inventory of our product which would reduce their order from wholesaler and consequently the wholesaler order from even if end user demand ha not changed for example during the fourth quarter of strong wholesaler and sub wholesaler purchase of our product resulted in inventory draw down by wholesaler and sub wholesaler in the first quarter of inventory in the distribution channel fluctuates from quarter to quarter we may continue to see fluctuation in our earnings and mismatch between prescription demand for our product and our revenue further because our hcv product represent cure and competitor hcv product have entered the market revenue from our hcv product are difficult for and investor to estimate the primary driver of our hcv product revenue are patient start net pricing and market share in our experience the number of patient start is very difficult to accurately predict in addition demand for our hcv product will depend on the extent of reimbursement of our hcv product by private and public payer in united state and other country private and public payer can choose to exclude our hcv product from their formulary coverage list or limit the type of patient for whom coverage will be provided which would negatively impact the demand for and revenue of our hcv product we continue to experience pricing pressure in the united state the european union and other country any change in the formulary coverage reimbursement level or discount or rebate offered on our hcv product to payer may negatively impact our anticipated revenue in addition because rebate claim for product discount are made by payer one or two quarter in arrears we estimate the rebate we will be required to pay in connection with sale during particular quarter based on claim data from prior quarter because hcv related revenue are difficult to predict investor may have widely varying expectation that may be materially higher or lower than our actual or anticipated revenue to the extent our actual or anticipated hcv product revenue exceed or fall short of these expectation our stock price may experience significant volatility yescarta chimeric antigen receptor car cell therapy represents novel approach to cancer treatment that creates significant challenge for yescarta car cell therapy involves harvesting cell from the patient blood ii engineering cell to express cancer specific receptor iii increasing the number of engineered cell and iv infusing the functional cancer specific cell back into the patient advancing this novel and personalized therapy creates significant challenge including educating and certifying medical personnel regarding the procedure and the potential side effect profile of our therapy such the potential adverse side effect related to cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxicity in compliance with the risk evaluation and mitigation strategy rem program required by fda for yescarta using medicine to manage adverse side effect of our therapy such tocilizumab and corticosteroid which may not be available in sufficient quantity may not adequately control the side effect and or may have detrimental impact on the efficacy of the treatment sourcing clinical and commercial supply for the material used to manufacture and process yescarta developing robust and reliable process while limiting contamination risk for engineering patient cell ex vivo and infusing the engineered cell back into the patient and conditioning patient with chemotherapy in advance of administering our therapy which may increase the risk of adverse side effect the use of engineered cell potential cancer treatment is recent development and may not be broadly accepted by physician patient hospital cancer treatment center payer and others in the medical community we may not be able to establish or demonstrate in the medical community the safety and efficacy of yescarta and the potential advantage and side effect compared to existing and future therapeutic if we fail to overcome these significant challenge our sale of yescarta result of operation and stock price could be adversely affected we may be required to pay significant damage to merck co inc merck result of jury finding that we willfully infringed patent owned by merck idenix subsidiary in december idenix universita degli studi di cagliari udsg centre national de la recherche scientifique and université montpellier ii sued in district court for the district of delaware alleging that the commercialization of sofosbuvir will infringe idenix patent no the patent and that an interference exists between the patent and our patent no also in december idenix and udsg sued in the district court for the district of massachusetts alleging that the commercialization of sofosbuvir will infringe patent no the patent and the patent in june the court transferred the massachusetts litigation to the district court for the district of delaware idenix wa acquired by merck in august prior to trial in december idenix committed to give covenant not to sue with respect to any claim arising out of the patent related to sofosbuvir and withdrew that patent from the trial in addition idenix declined to litigate the patent infringement action at trial in light of the appeal then pending at the court of appeal for the federal circuit cafc regarding who wa the first to invent the subject matter claimed in the patent in january the district court stayed idenix infringement claim on the patent pending the outcome of the appeal of the interference decision on that patent the second idenix interference described above unless idenix is successful in persuading the united state supreme court to consider further appeal to challenge the federal circuit june decision in our favor in the second idenix interference we will ask for dismissal of or for judgment to be entered against idenix on the infringement and interference claim jury trial wa held in december on the patent in december the jury found that we willfully infringed the asserted claim of the patent and awarded idenix billion in past damage the party filed post trial motion and briefing and the district judge heard oral argument in september in september the judge denied idenix motion for enhanced damage and attorney fee in february the judge granted our motion arguing that the patent is invalid for lacking enablement the grant of our motion invalidating idenix patent vacates the jury award of billion in past damage idenix ha indicated plan to appeal this decision to the cafc we believe the court decision correctly found that matter of law the patent is invalid and we remain confident in the merit of our case on appeal if the court decision invalidating idenix patent is overturned on appeal the amount we could be required to pay could be material the timing and magnitude of the amount of any such payment could have material adverse impact on our result of operation and stock price our result of operation may be adversely affected by current and potential future healthcare reform legislative and regulatory change to government prescription drug procurement and reimbursement program occur relatively frequently in the united state and foreign jurisdiction in the united state we along with other pharmaceutical manufacturer of branded drug product are required to pay portion of an industry fee also known the branded prescription drug bpd fee calculated based on select government sale during the year percentage of total industry government sale the amount of the annual bpd fee imposed on the pharmaceutical industry whole is billion in and billion in and thereafter our bpd fee expense were million in million in and million in the bpd fee is not tax deductible since the november election president trump and the congress have made numerous effort to repeal or amend the affordable care act in whole or in part in may the house of representative voted to pas the american health care act the ahca which would repeal many provision of the affordable care act although the senate considered but failed to pas the ahca and other comparable measure the congress may consider further legislation to repeal or replace element of the affordable care act in addition the tax cut and job act which president trump signed into law in december repeal the affordable care act individual health insurance mandate which is considered key component of the affordable care act the future stability of the affordable care act and the resulting impact on our business is thus uncertain and could be material in addition many state have proposed legislation that seek to indirectly or directly regulate pharmaceutical drug pricing by requiring biopharmaceutical manufacturer to publicly report proprietary pricing information or to place maximum price ceiling on pharmaceutical product purchased by

care program follow medicaid coverage and payment development the adverse effect may be magnified by private insurer adopting lower payment schedule our existing product are subject to reimbursement from government agency and other third party pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement pressure may reduce profitability successful commercialization of our product depends in part on the availability of governmental and third party payer reimbursement for the cost of such product and related treatment in the market where we sell our product government health authority private health insurer and other organization generally provide reimbursement in the united state the european union and other significant or potentially significant market for our product and product candidate government authority and third party payer are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical product and service significant portion of our sale of the majority of our product are subject to significant discount from list price face significant competition we face significant competition from global pharmaceutical and biotechnology company specialized pharmaceutical firm and generic drug manufacturer our product compete with other available product based primarily on efficacy safety tolerability acceptance by doctor ease of patient compliance ease of use price insurance and other reimbursement coverage distribution and marketing our hiv product compete primarily with product from viiv healthcare company viiv which market fixed dose combination product that compete with biktarvy descovy odefsey genvoya stribild complera eviplera atripla and truvada for example product marketed by viiv including tivicay dolutegravir triumeq abacavir dolutegravir lamivudine and juluca dolutegravir rilpivirine compete with our hiv product in addition lamivudine marketed by viiv competes with emtricitabine the active pharmaceutical ingredient of emtriva and component of biktarvy descovy odefsey genvoya stribild complera eviplera atripla and truvada for tybost we compete with ritonavir marketed by abbvie inc abbvie we also face competition from generic hiv product generic version of lamivudine and combivir lamivudine and zidovudine are available in the united state and certain other country generic version of efavirenz component of atripla are available in the united state canada and europe we have observed some pricing pressure related to the efavirenz component of our atripla sale tdf one of the active pharmaceutical ingredient in stribild complera eviplera atripla and truvada and the main active pharmaceutical ingredient in viread face generic competition in the european union the united state and certain other country in addition because emtricitabine the other active pharmaceutical ingredient of truvada face generic competition in the european union truvada also face generic competition in the european union and certain other country outside of the united state our hcv product sovaldi harvoni epclusa and vosevi compete primarily with mavyret glecaprevir pibrentasvir marketed by abbvie and zepatier elbasvir and grazoprevir marketed by merck our hbv product vemlidy viread and hepsera face competition from existing therapy for treating patient with hbv our hbv product face competition from generic version of tdf our hbv product also compete with baraclude entecavir an oral nucleoside analog marketed by bristol myers squibb company bm well generic entecavir and tyzeka sebivo telbivudine an oral nucleoside analog marketed by novartis pharmaceutical corporation novartis yescarta is expected to compete with other company developing advanced cell therapy for the treatment of relapsed refractory diffuse large cell lymphoma including novartis letairis competes with tracleer bosentan and opsumit macitentan marketed by actelion pharmaceutical inc and also with adcirca tadalafil marketed by united therapeutic corporation and pfizer inc letairis is also expected to face generic competition in the united state starting in july ranexa competes predominantly with generic compound from three distinct class of drug for the treatment of chronic angina in the united state including generic and or branded beta blocker calcium channel blocker and long acting nitrate ranexa is also expected to face generic competition in the united state starting in in addition number of company are pursuing the development of technology which are competitive with our existing product or research program these competing company include specialized pharmaceutical firm and large pharmaceutical company acting either independently or together with other pharmaceutical company furthermore academic institution government agency and other public and private organization conducting research may seek patent protection and may establish collaborative arrangement for competitive product or program if any of these competitor gain market share result of new technology commercialization strategy or otherwise it could adversely affect our result of operation and stock price law and regulation applicable to the health care industry could impose new obligation on require to change our business practice and restrict our operation in the future the health care industry is subject to various federal state and international law and regulation pertaining to drug reimbursement rebate price reporting health care fraud and abuse and data privacy and security in the united state these law include anti kickback and false claim law law and regulation relating to the medicare and medicaid program and other federal and state program the medicaid rebate statute individual state law relating to pricing and sale and marketing practice the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa and other federal and state law relating to the privacy and security of health information violation of these law or any related regulation may be punishable by criminal and or civil sanction including in some instance substantial fine civil monetary penalty exclusion from participation in federal and state health care program including medicare medicaid veteran administration health program and federal employee health benefit program action against executive overseeing our business and burdensome remediation measure in addition these law and regulation are broad in scope and they are subject to change and evolving interpretation which could require to incur substantial cost associated with compliance or to alter one or more of it sale or marketing practice violation of these law or allegation of violation could also result in negative publicity or other consequence that could harm our reputation disrupt our business or adversely affect our result of operation if any or all of these event occur our business and stock price could be materially and adversely affected recently there ha been enhanced scrutiny of company sponsored patient assistance program including insurance premium and co pay assistance program and donation to third party charity that provide such assistance there ha also been enhanced scrutiny by government on reimbursement support offering clinical education program and promotional speaker program if we or our agent vendor or donation recipient are deemed to have failed to comply with law regulation or government guidance in any of these area we could be subject to criminal or civil sanction any similar violation by our competitor could also negatively impact our industry reputation and increase scrutiny over our business and our product see description of our government investigation and related litigation in note commitment and contingency legal proceeding of the note to consolidated financial statement included in part ii item of this annual report on form approximately of our product sale occur outside the united state and currency fluctuation and hedging expense may cause our earnings to fluctuate which could adversely affect our stock price because significant percentage of our product sale are denominated in foreign currency primarily the euro we face exposure to adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rate when the dollar strengthens against these foreign currency the relative value of sale made in the respective foreign currency decrease conversely when the dollar weakens against these currency the relative value of such sale increase overall we are net receiver of foreign currency and therefore benefit from weaker dollar and are adversely affected by stronger dollar we use foreign currency exchange forward and option contract to hedge percentage of our forecasted international sale primarily those denominated in the euro we also hedge certain monetary asset and liability denominated in foreign currency which reduces but doe not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuation between the date transaction is recorded and the date cash is collected or paid foreign currency exchange net of hedge had an unfavorable impact on our product sale of million for the year ended december compared to the period in we can not predict future fluctuation in the foreign currency exchange rate of the dollar if the dollar appreciates significantly against certain currency and our hedging program doe not sufficiently offset the effect of such appreciation our result of operation will be adversely affected and our stock price may decline additionally the expense that we recognize in relation to our hedging activity can also cause our earnings to fluctuate the level of hedging expense that we recognize in particular period is impacted by the change in interest rate spread between the foreign currency that we hedge and the dollar if significant safety issue arise for our marketed product or our product candidate our future sale may be reduced which would adversely affect our result of operation the data supporting the marketing approval for our product and forming the basis for the safety warning in our product label were obtained in controlled clinical trial of limited duration and in some case from post approval use our product are used over longer period of time by many patient with underlying health problem taking numerous other medicine we expect to continue to find new issue such safety resistance or drug interaction issue which may require to provide additional warning or contraindication on our label or narrow our approved indication each of which could reduce the market acceptance of these product regulatory authority have been moving towards more active and transparent pharmacovigilance and are making greater amount of stand alone safety information and clinical trial data directly available to the public through website and other mean such periodic safety update report summary risk management plan summary and various adverse event data safety information without the appropriate context and expertise may be misinterpreted and lead to misperception or legal action which may potentially cause our product sale or stock price to decline for yescarta novel car cell therapy treatment related adverse effect may not be appropriately recognized and managed by the treating medical staff toxicity resulting from personalized cell therapy are not typically encountered in the general patient population and by medical personnel common medicine that may be used at academic medical center and hospital to help manage adverse side effect of yescarta such tocilizumab and corticosteroid may not be available in sufficient quantity may not adequately control such adverse side effect and or may have detrimental impact on the efficacy of the treatment we have trained and expect to continue to train medical personnel to understand the side effect profile of yescarta in compliance with the rem program required by fda for yescarta although we can give no assurance on the efficacy of our training effort inadequate training in recognizing or managing the potential adverse effect of yescarta or the disregard or modification of our training by medical staff could result in more severe or prolonged toxicity or even patient death if serious safety resistance or drug interaction issue arise with our marketed product sale of these product could be limited or halted by or by regulatory authority and our result of operation would be adversely affected our operation depend on compliance with complex fda and comparable international regulation failure to obtain broad approval on timely basis or to maintain compliance could delay or halt commercialization of our product the product we develop must be approved for marketing and sale by regulatory authority and once approved are subject to extensive regulation by fda the european medicine agency ema and comparable regulatory agency in other country we are continuing clinical trial for many of our product for currently approved and additional us we anticipate that we will file for marketing approval in additional country and for additional indication and product over the next several year these product may fail to receive such marketing approval on timely basis or at all further how we manufacture and sell our product is subject to extensive regulation and review discovery of previously unknown problem with our marketed product or problem with our manufacturing safety reporting or promotional activity may result in restriction on our product including withdrawal of the product from the market if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirement including those related to promotion and manufacturing we could be subject to penalty including fine suspension of regulatory approval product recall seizure of product and criminal prosecution for example under fda rule we are often required to conduct post approval clinical study to ass known serious risk signal of serious risk or to identify an unexpected serious risk and implement rem for our product which could include medication guide patient package insert communication plan to healthcare provider or other element fda deems are necessary to assure safe use of the drug which could include imposing certain restriction on the distribution or use of product failure to comply with these or other requirement imposed by fda could result in significant civil monetary penalty and our operating result may be adversely affected the result and anticipated timeline of our clinical trial are uncertain and may not support continued development of product candidate which would adversely affect our prospect for future revenue growth we are required to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of product that we develop for each intended use through extensive preclinical study and clinical trial the result from preclinical and early clinical study do not always accurately predict result in later large scale clinical trial even successfully completed large scale clinical trial may not result in marketable product for example during we terminated our phase study of for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and cystic fibrosis and our phase study of for the treatment of hepatitis virus after determining that study data showed insufficient evidence of treatment benefit if any of our product candidate fails to achieve it primary endpoint in clinical trial if safety issue arise or if the result from our clinical trial are otherwise inadequate to support regulatory approval of our product candidate commercialization of that product candidate could be delayed or halted in addition we may also face challenge in clinical trial protocol design if the clinical trial for any of the product candidate in our pipeline are delayed or terminated our prospect for future revenue growth would be adversely impacted for example we face numerous risk and uncertainty with our product candidate including descovy for pre exposure prophylaxis prep selonsertib for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis nash andecaliximab for the treatment of gastric cancer axicabtagene ciloleucel for the treatment of second line diffuse large cell lymphoma and filgotinib for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis crohn disease and ulcerative colitis each currently in phase clinical trial that could prevent completion of development of these product candidate these risk include our ability to enroll patient in clinical trial the possibility of unfavorable result of our clinical trial the need to modify or delay our clinical trial or to perform additional trial and the risk of failing to obtain fda and other regulatory body approval result our product candidate may never be successfully commercialized further we may make strategic decision to discontinue development of our product candidate if for example we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunity in our pipeline if these program and others in our pipeline can not be completed on timely basis or at all then our prospect for future revenue growth may be adversely impacted in addition clinical trial involving our commercial product could raise new safety issue for our existing product which could in turn decrease our revenue and harm our business due to our reliance on third party contract research organization to conduct our clinical trial we are unable to directly control the timing conduct expense and quality of our clinical trial we extensively outsource our clinical trial activity and usually perform only small portion of the start up activity in house we rely on independent third party contract research organization cro to perform most of our clinical study including document preparation site identification screening and preparation pre study visit training program management and bioanalytical analysis many important aspect of the service performed for by the cro are out of our direct control if there is any dispute or disruption in our relationship with our cro our clinical trial may be delayed moreover in our regulatory submission we rely on the quality and validity of the clinical work performed by third party cro if any of our cro process or result were determined to be invalid or inadequate our own clinical data and result and related regulatory approval could be adversely affected we depend on relationship with other company for sale and marketing performance technology development logistics and commercialization of product candidate and revenue failure to maintain these relationship poor performance by these company or dispute with these company could negatively impact our business we rely on number of significant collaborative relationship with major pharmaceutical company for our sale and marketing performance in certain territory these include collaboration with janssen science ireland uc for odefsey complera eviplera and symtuza in europe and bm for atripla in europe in some country we rely on international distributor for sale of certain of our product some of these relationship also involve the clinical development of these product by our partner reliance on collaborative relationship pose number of risk including the risk that we are unable to control the resource our corporate partner devote to our program or product dispute may arise with respect to the ownership of right to technology developed with our corporate partner disagreement with our corporate partner could cause delay in or termination of the research development or commercialization of product candidate or result in litigation or arbitration contract with our corporate partner may fail to provide significant protection or may fail to be effectively enforced if one of these partner fails to perform our corporate partner have considerable discretion in electing whether to pursue the development of any additional product and may pursue alternative technology or product either on their own or in collaboration with our competitor our corporate partner with marketing right may choose to pursue competing technology or to devote fewer resource to the marketing of our product than they do to product of their own development and our distributor and our corporate partner may be unable to pay given these risk there is great deal of uncertainty regarding the success of our current and future collaborative effort if these effort fail our product development or commercialization of new product could be delayed or revenue from product could decline yescarta is available only through rem program which is required by fda to mitigate the potential risk of the product only hospital and their associated clinic certified in the rem program are permitted to dispense yescarta all relevant staff involved in the prescribing dispensing or administering of yescarta must be trained on the rem program requirement and must successfully complete rem program knowledge assessment failure of hospital and clinic to enroll in the yescarta rem program or to successfully complete and comply with the program requirement may result in regulatory action from fda or decreased sale of yescarta which could harm our business and our reputation for yescarta we rely on technology partner to assist in the development and maintenance of the kite konnect platform this platform is critical to ensure positive prescriber and patient experience well chain of identity and chain of custody of yescarta if the technology platform is incomplete insufficiently maintained or develops technological issue we may experience disruption to the sale and logistics of our yescarta business which could extend for significant period of time and we may need to expend considerable resource and time to repair or improve the platform in cooperation with our partner in addition we rely on site to collect patient white blood cell known apheresis center shipper courier and hospital for the logistical collection of patient white blood cell and ultimate delivery of yescarta to patient any disruption or difficulty incurred by any of these vendor could result in product loss and regulatory action and harm our yescarta business and our reputation in addition to ensure that any apheresis center is prepared to ship cell to our manufacturing facility we plan to conduct quality certification of each apheresis center however apheresis center may choose not to participate in the certification process or we may be unable to complete certification in timely manner or at all which could delay or restrain our manufacturing and commercialization effort result our sale of yescarta may be limited which could harm our result of operation our success depends to significant degree on our ability to defend our patent and other intellectual property right both domestically and internationally we may not be able to obtain effective patent to protect our technology from use by competitor and patent of other company could require to stop using or pay for the use of required technology patent and other proprietary right are very important to our business our success depends to significant degree on our ability to obtain patent and license to patent right preserve trade secret and internal know how defend against infringement and effort to invalidate our patent and operate without infringing on the intellectual property of others if we have properly drafted and enforceable patent it can be more difficult for our competitor to use our technology to create competitive product and more difficult for our competitor to obtain patent that prevents from using technology we create part of our business strategy we actively seek patent protection both in the united state and internationally and file additional patent application when appropriate to cover improvement in our compound product and technology we have number of and foreign patent patent application and right to patent related to our compound product and technology but we can not be certain that issued patent will be enforceable or provide adequate protection or that pending patent application will result in issued patent patent application are confidential for period of time before patent is issued result we may not know if our competitor filed patent application for technology covered by our pending application or if we were the first to invent or first to file an application directed toward the technology that is the subject of our patent application competitor may have filed patent application or received patent and may obtain additional patent and proprietary right that block or compete with our product in addition if competitor file patent application covering our technology we may have to participate in litigation interference or other proceeding to determine the right to patent or validity of any patent granted litigation interference or other proceeding are unpredictable and expensive and could divert management attention from other operation such that even if we are ultimately successful our result of operation may be adversely affected by such event for example tdf one of the active pharmaceutical ingredient in stribild complera eviplera atripla and truvada and the main active pharmaceutical ingredient in viread face generic competition in the european union the united state and certain other country in addition because emtricitabine the other active pharmaceutical ingredient of truvada face generic competition in the european union truvada also face generic competition in the european union and certain other country outside of the united state letairis is also expected to face generic competition in the united state starting in july the entry of these generic product may lead to market share and price erosion and have negative impact on our business and result of operation in addition we do not own any patent covering ranolazine the active ingredient of ranexa instead when it wa discovered that only sustained release formulation of ranolazine would achieve therapeutic plasma level we obtained patent on those formulation and the characteristic plasma level they achieve for yescarta the composition of matter patent ha expired in the european union in the european union and the united state patent application are pending related to kite proprietary manufacturing process we may obtain patent for certain product many year before marketing approval is obtained for those product because patent have limited life which may begin to run prior to the commercial sale of the related product the commercial value of the patent may be limited however we may be able to apply for patent term extension or supplementary protection certificate in some country generic manufacturer have sought and may continue to seek fda approval to market generic version of our product through an abbreviated new drug application anda the application form typically used by manufacturer seeking approval of generic drug see description of our anda litigation in note commitment and contingency legal proceeding of the note to consolidated financial statement included in part ii item of this annual report on form and risk factor entitled litigation with generic manufacturer ha increased our expense which may continue to reduce our earnings if we are unsuccessful in all or some of these lawsuit some or all of our claim in the patent may be narrowed or invalidated and generic version of our product could be launched prior to our patent expiry beginning on page our success depends in large part on our ability to operate without infringing upon the patent or other proprietary right of third party if we infringe the valid patent of third party we may be required to pay significant monetary damage or we may be prevented from commercializing product or may be required to obtain license from these third party we may not be able to obtain alternative technology or any required license on commercially reasonable term or at all if we fail to obtain these license or alternative technology we may be unable to develop or commercialize some or all of our product for example we are aware of patent and patent application owned by third party that such party may claim to cover the use of sofosbuvir axicabtagene ciloleucel and bictegravir see also description of our litigation regarding sofosbuvir axicabtagene ciloleucel and bictegravir in note commitment and contingency legal proceeding of the note to consolidated financial statement included in part ii item of this annual report on form and the risk factor entitled if any of our hcv product is proven to infringe the patent of any third party we may be required to pay significant monetary damage which could adversely affect our financial result beginning on page and if any party is successful in establishing exclusive right to axicabtagene ciloleucel our anticipated revenue and earnings from the sale of that product could be adversely affected beginning on page we are also aware of patent no and assigned to the department of health and human service that purport to claim process of protecting primate host from infection by an immunodeficiency retrovirus by administering combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir or tdf prior to exposure of the host to the immunodeficiency retrovirus we have been in contact with the department of health and human service about the scope and relevance of the patent and have explained that we not believe that these patent are valid because the patent office wa not given the most relevant prior art and because physician and patient were using the claimed method year before the center for disease control and prevention filed the application for the patent furthermore we also rely on unpatented trade secret and improvement unpatented internal know how and technological innovation for example great deal of our liposomal manufacturing expertise which is key component of our liposomal technology is not covered by patent but is instead protected trade secret we protect these right mainly through confidentiality agreement with our corporate partner employee consultant and vendor these agreement provide that all confidential information developed or made known to an individual during the course of their relationship with will be kept confidential and will not be used or disclosed to third party except in specified circumstance in the case of employee the agreement provide that all invention made by an individual while employed by will be our exclusive property we can not be certain that these party will comply with these confidentiality agreement that we have adequate remedy for any breach or that our trade secret internal know how or technological innovation will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitor under some of our agreement invention become jointly owned by and our corporate partner and in other case become the exclusive property of one party in certain circumstance it can be difficult to determine who owns particular invention and dispute could arise regarding those invention if our trade secret internal know how technological innovation or confidential information become known or independently discovered by competitor or if we enter into dispute over ownership of invention our business and result of operation could be adversely affected if any of our hcv product is proven to infringe the patent of any third party we may be required to pay significant monetary damage which could adversely affect our financial result we own patent and patent application that claim sofosbuvir sovaldi chemical entity and it metabolite and the fixed dose combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir harvoni sofosbuvir and velpatasvir epclusa and sofosbuvir velpatasvir and voxilaprevir vosevi we are aware of patent and patent application owned by third party that have been or may in the future be alleged by such party to cover the use of our hcv product if third party obtain valid and enforceable patent and successfully prove infringement of those patent by our hcv product we could be required to pay significant monetary damage current legal proceeding of significance related to sofosbuvir include litigation with idenix pharmaceutical inc idenix in march the european patent office epo granted idenix european patent no the patent which corresponds to the patent the same day that the patent wa granted we filed an opposition with the epo seeking to revoke the patent an opposition hearing wa held in february and the epo ruled in our favor and revoked the patent idenix ha appealed see also description of our idenix litigation in note commitment and contingency legal proceeding of the note to consolidated financial statement included in part ii item of this annual report on form litigation with merck in august merck contacted requesting that we pay royalty on the sale of sofosbuvir and obtain license to patent no the patent and patent no the patent which it co owns with ionis pharmaceutical inc the and patent cover compound which do not include but may relate to sofosbuvir we filed lawsuit in august in the district court for the northern district of california seeking declaratory judgment that the merck patent are invalid and not infringed during patent prosecution merck amended it patent application in an attempt to cover compound related to sofosbuvir initially in march jury determined that we had not established that merck patent are invalid for lack of written description or lack of enablement and awarded merck million in damage however in june the court ruled in our favor on our defense of unclean hand and determined that merck may not recover any damage from for the and patent the judge ha determined that merck is required to pay our attorney fee due to the exceptional nature of this case in july the court issued decision setting the amount of attorney fee awarded to gilead merck ha filed notice of appeal to the cafc regarding the court decision on our defense of unclean hand and it award of attorney fee we appealed the issue relating to the invalidity of merck patent the cafc heard oral argument in february if the decision on our defense of unclean hand is reversed on appeal and merck patent is upheld we may be required to pay damage and royalty on sale of sofosbuvir containing product following the appeal in that event the judge ha indicated that will determine the amount of the royalty if necessary at the conclusion of any appeal in this case litigation with the university of minnesotathe university of minnesota the university ha obtained patent no patent which purport to broadly cover nucleoside with antiviral and anticancer activity in august the university filed lawsuit against in the court for the district of minnesota alleging that the commercialization of sofosbuvir containing product infringes the patent we believe that the patent is invalid and will not be infringed by the continued commercialization of sofosbuvir in october the court granted our motion to transfer the case to california we have also filed four petition for inter partes review in the uspto alleging that all asserted claim are invalid for anticipation and obviousness petition for inter partes review filed by initiative for medicine access knowledgein october we received notice that initiative for medicine access knowledge mak submitted multiple petition requesting inter partes review to the uspto patent trial and appeal board ptab alleging that certain patent associated with sofosbuvir are invalid either not novel or obvious we strongly believe mak petition are without merit and that sofosbuvir the only approved hcv drug of it kind is both novel and not obvious accordingly we will defend against these allegation if the ptab decides to initiate one or more inter partes review decision would be expected about year later either party can appeal the ptab decision to the cafc european patent claimsin february several party filed opposition in the epo requesting revocation of one of our granted european patent covering sofosbuvir that expires in in october the epo upheld the validity of certain claim of our sofosbuvir patent we anticipate that the challenger will appeal this decision in favor of our patent we have appealed this decision seeking to restore all of the original claim and several of the original opposing party have also appealed requesting full revocation the appeal process may take several year in april several party filed opposition in the epo requesting revocation of our granted european patent relating to sofosbuvir that expires in we can not predict the ultimate outcome of intellectual property claim related to our hcv product and we have spent and will continue to spend significant resource defending against these claim if we are unsuccessful in all or some of these lawsuit we could be required to pay significant monetary damage which could have significant negative effect on our financial result if any party is successful in establishing exclusive right to axicabtagene ciloleucel our anticipated revenue and earnings from the sale of that product could be adversely affected in october we acquired kite which is now our wholly owned subsidiary through the acquisition we acquired axicabtagene ciloleucel car cell therapy in october we received approval from fda for axicabtagene ciloleucel now known commercially yescarta we own patent and patent application that claim axicabtagene ciloleucel chimeric dna segment third party may have or may obtain right to patent that allegedly could be used to prevent or attempt to prevent from commercializing axicabtagene ciloleucel or to require to obtain license in order to commercialize axicabtagene ciloleucel for example we are aware that juno therapeutic inc juno ha exclusively licensed patent no the patent which wa issued to sloan kettering cancer center in september juno and sloan kettering cancer center filed lawsuit against kite in the district court for the central district of california alleging that the commercialization of axicabtagene ciloleucel infringes the patent in october following fda approval for yescarta juno filed second complaint alleging that axicabtagene ciloleucel infringes the patent juno subsequently moved to dismiss the september complaint and ha maintained the october complaint in august kite filed petition for inter partes review in the uspto alleging that the asserted claim of the patent are invalid obvious in december the ptab determined that the claim of the patent are not invalid due to obviousness in february kite filed notice of appeal to the cafc that appeal is currently pending we can not predict the ultimate outcome of intellectual property claim related to axicabtagene ciloleucel if juno patent is upheld valid and juno successfully prof infringement of that patent by axicabtagene ciloleucel we could be prevented from selling yescarta unless we were able to obtain license to this patent such license may not be available on commercially reasonable term or at all which could adversely impact our business and result of operation manufacturing problem including at our third party manufacturer and corporate partner could cause inventory shortage and delay product shipment and regulatory approval which may adversely affect our result of operation in order to generate revenue from our product we must be able to produce sufficient quantity of our product to satisfy demand many of our product are the result of complex manufacturing process the manufacturing process for pharmaceutical product is also highly regulated and regulator may shut down manufacturing facility that they believe do not comply with regulation our product are either manufactured at our own facility or by third party manufacturer or corporate partner we depend on third party to perform manufacturing activity effectively and on timely basis for the majority of our solid dose product our third party manufacturer and our corporate partner are subject to good manufacturing practice gmp which are extensive regulation governing manufacturing process stability testing record keeping and quality standard defined by fda and ema similar regulation are in effect in other jurisdiction our third party manufacturer and corporate partner are independent entity who are subject to their own unique operational and financial risk which are out of our control if we or any of these third party manufacturer or corporate partner fail to perform required this could impair our ability to deliver our product on timely basis or receive royalty or cause delay in our clinical trial and application for regulatory approval further we may have to write off the cost of manufacturing any batch that fails to pas quality inspection or meet regulatory approval in addition we our third party manufacturer and our corporate partner may only be able to produce some of our product at one or limited number of facility and therefore have limited manufacturing capacity for certain product and we may not be able to locate additional or replacement facility on reasonable basis or at all our sale of such product could also be adversely impacted by our reliance on such limited number of facility to the extent these risk materialize and affect their performance obligation to our financial result may be adversely affected our manufacturing operation are subject to routine inspection by regulatory agency if we are unable to remedy any deficiency cited by fda in these inspection our currently marketed product and the timing of regulatory approval of product in development could be adversely affected further there is risk that regulatory agency in other country where marketing application are pending will undertake similar additional review or apply heightened standard of review which could delay the regulatory approval for product in those country if approval of any of our product candidate were delayed or if production of our marketed product wa interrupted our anticipated revenue and our stock price would be adversely affected we have limited experience managing the cell engineering process and our process may be more difficult or more expensive than the approach taken by our current and future competitor we can not be sure that the manufacturing process employed by will result in engineered cell that will be safe and effective in addition we may encounter difficulty in production particularly in scaling up and validating initial production to meet patient demand and ensuring the absence of contamination these problem could include difficulty with production cost and yield quality control including stability of the product quality assurance testing operator error shortage of qualified personnel well compliance with strictly enforced federal state and foreign regulation further if contaminant are discovered in our supply of yescarta or in the manufacturing facility such manufacturing facility may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination which could require substantial resource and management attention we can not assure you that any stability or other issue relating to the manufacture of yescarta will not occur in the future or that any such issue may be remedied on timely basis or at all in addition we may fail to manage the logistics of collecting and shipping patient material to the manufacturing site and shipping yescarta back to the patient logistical and shipment delay and problem caused by our vendor or other factor not in our control such weather and natural disaster could prevent or delay the delivery of our product and product candidate to patient additionally we are required to maintain complex chain of identity and custody with respect to patient material such material move to the manufacturing facility through the manufacturing process and back to the patient failure to maintain chain of identity and custody could result in patient death loss of product or regulatory action which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and our stock price we may not be able to obtain material or supply necessary to conduct clinical trial or to manufacture and sell our product which would limit our ability to generate revenue we need access to certain supply and product to conduct our clinical trial and to manufacture our product if we are unable to purchase sufficient quantity of these material or find suitable alternate material in timely manner our development effort for our product candidate may be delayed or our ability to manufacture our product would be limited which would limit our ability to generate revenue supplier of key component and material must be named in the new drug application or maa filed with fda ema or other regulatory authority for any product candidate for which we are seeking marketing approval and significant delay can occur if the qualification of new supplier is required even after manufacturer is qualified by the regulatory authority the manufacturer must continue to expend time money and effort in the area of production and quality control to ensure full compliance with gmp manufacturer are subject to regular periodic inspection by the regulatory authority following initial approval if result of these inspection regulatory authority determines that the equipment facility laboratory or process do not comply with applicable regulation and condition of product approval the regulatory authority may suspend the manufacturing operation if the manufacturing operation of any of the single supplier for our product are suspended we may be unable to generate sufficient quantity of commercial or clinical supply of product to meet market demand which would in turn decrease our revenue and harm our business in addition if delivery of material from our supplier were interrupted for any reason we may be unable to ship certain of our product for commercial supply or to supply our product in development for clinical trial in addition some of our product and the material that we utilize in our operation are made at only one facility which we may not able to replace in timely manner and on commercially reasonable term or at all problem with any of the single supplier we depend on in the event of disaster including an earthquake equipment failure or other difficulty may negatively impact our development and commercialization effort significant portion of the raw material and intermediate used to manufacture our antiviral product are supplied by third party manufacturer and corporate partner outside of the united state result any political or economic factor in specific country or region including any change in or interpretation of trade regulation compliance requirement or tax legislation that would limit or prevent third party outside of the united state from supplying these material would adversely affect our ability to manufacture and supply our antiviral product to meet market need and have material and adverse effect on our operating result if we were to encounter any of these difficulty our ability to provide our product and product candidate to patient would be jeopardized litigation with generic manufacturer ha increased our expense which may continue to reduce our earnings if we are unsuccessful in all or some of these lawsuit some or all of our claim in the patent may be narrowed or invalidated and generic version of our product could be launched prior to our patent expiry part of the approval process for some of our product fda granted new chemical entity nce exclusivity period during which other manufacturer application for approval of generic version of our product will not be approved generic manufacturer may challenge the patent protecting product that have been granted nce exclusivity one year prior to the end of the nce exclusivity period generic manufacturer have sought and may continue to seek fda approval for similar or identical drug through an anda the application form typically used by manufacturer seeking approval of generic drug to seek approval for generic version of product nce status generic manufacturer may submit it anda to fda four year after the branded product approval for sofosbuvir this date fall in december consequently it is possible that one or more generic manufacturer can file an anda for sofosbuvir of december current legal proceeding of significance with some of our generic manufacturer include mylanin february we received notice that mylan pharmaceutical inc mylan submitted an anda to fda requesting permission to manufacture and market generic version of tybost cobicistat in the notice mylan alleges that the patent covering cobicistat is invalid obvious and that mylan generic product can not infringe an invalid claim in march we filed lawsuit against mylan in the district court for the district of delaware and district court for the northern district of west virginia the party have agreed to dismiss the action in west virginia and the trial in delaware wa stayed the patent in suit that cover tybost is also listed in the orange book for stribild and genvoya in november we received notice that mylan submitted an anda to fda requesting permission to manufacture and market generic version of evotaz atazanavir cobicistat and challenging the validity of our cobicistat compound patent citing the argument it ha made in the ongoing litigation involving tybost in december we filed lawsuit against mylan in the district court for the northern district of west virginia amnealin may we received notice that amneal pharmaceutical llc amneal submitted an anda to fda requesting permission to manufacture and market generic version of truvada at low dosage strength in the notice amneal alleges that two patent associated with emtricitabine are invalid unenforceable and or will not be infringed by amneal manufacture use or sale of generic version of truvada at low dosage strength in july we filed lawsuit against amneal in the district court for the district of delaware for infringement of our patent natco and tevain february we received notice from natco pharma limited natco and teva pharmaceutical teva that they have each submitted an anda to fda requesting permission to manufacture and market generic version of sovaldi in teva notice it alleges that nine patent associated with sofosbuvir are invalid unenforceable and or will not be infringed by teva manufacture use or sale of generic version of sovaldi in natco notice it alleges that two patent associated with sofosbuvir are invalid unenforceable and or will not be infringed by natco manufacture use or sale of generic version of sovaldi natco did not challenge all patent listed on the orange book for sovaldi we are evaluating the notice letter and determining next step we can not predict the ultimate outcome of the foregoing action and other litigation with generic manufacturer and we may spend significant resource enforcing and defending these patent if we are unsuccessful in these lawsuit some or all of our original claim in the patent may be narrowed or invalidated and the patent protection for these product could be substantially shortened further if all of the patent covering one or more product are invalidated fda could approve the request to manufacture generic version of such product in the united state prior to the expiration date of those patent the sale of generic version these product earlier than their patent expiration would have significant negative effect on our revenue and result of operation import from country where our product are available at lower price and unapproved generic or counterfeit version of our product could have negative impact on our reputation and business price for our product are based on local market economics and competition and sometimes differ from country to country our sale in country with relatively higher price may be reduced if product can be imported into those or other country from lower price market if our hiv hbv and hcv product which we have agreed to make available at substantially reduced price to certain low and middle income country participating in our gilead access program are re exported from these low and middle income country into the united state europe or other higher price market our revenue would be adversely affected in addition we have entered into voluntary licensing agreement with generic drug company in india south africa and china well licensing agreement with the medicine patent pool united nation backed public health organization which allows generic drug company to manufacture generic version of hiv and hbv product incorporating our licensed compound taf cobicistat elvitegravir and bictegravir for distribution in certain low and middle income country we have also entered into licensing agreement with generic manufacturer in india egypt and pakistan to produce and distribute generic version of our hcv product in certain low and middle income country if generic version of our hiv hbv and hcv product under these license are then re exported to the united state europe or other market outside of these low and middle income country our revenue would be adversely affected in addition purchase of our product in country where our selling price are relatively low for resale in country in which our selling price are relatively high may adversely impact our revenue and gross margin and may cause our sale to fluctuate from quarter to quarter for example in the european union we are required to permit product purchased in one country to be sold in another country purchase of our product in country where our selling price are relatively low for resale in country in which our selling price are relatively high can affect the inventory level held by our wholesaler and can cause the relative sale level in the various country to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and not reflect the actual consumer demand in any given quarter these quarterly fluctuation may impact our earnings which could adversely affect our stock price and harm our business we are also aware of the existence of various buyer club around the world that promote the personal importation of generic version of our hcv product that have not been approved for use in the country into which they are imported result patient may be at risk of taking unapproved medication which may not be they purport to be may not have the potency they claim to have or may contain harmful substance to the extent patient take unapproved generic version of one or more of our medication and are injured or not cured by these product our brand or the commercial or scientific reputation of our hcv product could be harmed further third party may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit version of our product which do not meet the rigorous quality standard of our manufacturing and supply chain for example in the first quarter of bottle of counterfeit drug labeled under the harvoni brand name were discovered at retail pharmacy chain and pharmaceutical wholesaler in japan we investigated this matter and accelerated planned change to our product packaging to make counterfeiting more difficult we cooperated and continue to cooperate with the japanese health ministry also in the third quarter of bottle of counterfeit drug labeled under the sovaldi brand name were discovered at retail pharmacy chain and pharmaceutical wholesaler in germany we investigated this matter and determined that number of wholesaler had obtained sovaldi from an unapproved source we cooperated and continue to cooperate with the german regulatory authority also in there were report that product labeled epclusa wa available in multiple country which we determined wa not authentic product based on sample analysis and the lot number we are working with regulatory authority to investigate this matter we actively take action to discourage counterfeit of our product around the world including working with local regulatory and legal authority to enforce law against counterfeit drug counterfeit drug pose serious risk to patient health and safety our reputation and business could suffer result of counterfeit drug sold under our brand name expensive litigation and government investigation have increased our expense which may continue to reduce our earnings we are involved in number of litigation investigation and other dispute related matter that require to expend substantial internal and financial resource we expect these matter will continue to require high level of internal and financial resource for the foreseeable future these matter have reduced and will continue to reduce our earnings and require significant management attention please see description of our litigation investigation and other dispute related matter in note commitment and contingency legal proceeding of the note to consolidated financial statement included in part ii item of this annual report on form the outcome of such legal proceeding or any other legal proceeding that may be brought against the investigation or any other investigation that may be initiated and any other dispute related matter are inherently uncertain and adverse development or outcome can result in significant expense monetary damage penalty or injunctive relief against that could significantly reduce our earnings and cash flow and harm our business some country we may be required to grant compulsory license for our product or our patent may not be enforced in number of developing country government official and other interested group have suggested that pharmaceutical company should make drug for hiv or hcv infection available at low cost alternatively government in those developing country could require that we grant compulsory license to allow competitor to manufacture and sell their own version of our product thereby reducing our product sale for example there is growing attention on the availability of hcv therapy and some activist are advocating for the increased availability of hcv therapy through other mean including compulsory license the government of malaysia ha exercised government right under section of the malaysian patent act to practice the patented invention of sofosbuvir for period of three year for use only in government hospital and clinic we are challenging the malaysian government action in the past certain office of the government of brazil have expressed concern over the affordability of our hiv product and declared that they were considering issuing compulsory license to permit the manufacture of otherwise patented product for hiv infection including viread if compulsory license permit generic manufacturing to override our product patent for our hiv hcv or other product or if we are required to grant compulsory license for these product it could reduce our earnings and cash flow and harm our business in addition certain country do not permit enforcement of our patent or permit our patent to issue and third party manufacturer are able to sell generic version of our product in those country for example in the brazilian health regulatory agency rejected our patent application related to sofosbuvir and our hcv product we successfully appealed those

highlight during total revenue decreased to billion and total product sale decreased to billion compared to billion and billion in respectively primarily due to the competitive dynamic of the hcv

commercial perspective we will support the launch of biktarvy and continue to promote the use of our existing taf containing regimen in addition we believe truvada for pre exposure prophylaxis prep will continue to be an integral part of our growth in hiv in the united state community embrace the public health benefit of prevention in hcv we expect decline in product sale in all major market result of increased competition hcv revenue are driven by four variable patient start net pricing market share and treatment duration treatment duration ha stabilized variable and pricing of all regimen ha gravitated towards the week regimen price we anticipate both pricing and market share to stabilize by mid with more predictable but slightly declining patient start moving forward in cell therapy we will continue to promote the use of yescarta in the united state and prepare for anticipated approval in europe we will continue to help ensure patient access to our product around the world including through our gilead access program under which more than million people receive our hiv medicine in low and middle income country our progress on all of these initiative is subject to number of uncertainty including but not limited to the continuation of an uncertain global macroeconomic environment additional pricing pressure from payer and competitor slower than anticipated growth in our hiv product an increase in discount chargebacks and rebate due to ongoing contract and future negotiation with commercial and government payer market share and price erosion caused by the introduction of generic version of truvada outside the united state and viread and letairis in the united state inaccuracy in our hcv patient start estimate potential amendment to the affordable

policy estimate and judgment the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and result of operation is based on our consolidated financial statement included in item of this annual report on form which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle the preparation of these financial statement requires to make estimate and judgment that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense and related disclosure on an ongoing basis we evaluate and base our estimate on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumption that we believe be reasonable under the circumstance the result of which form the basis for making judgment about the carrying value of asset and liability that are not readily apparent from other source actual result may differ significantly from these estimate we believe the following critical accounting policy reflect the more significant judgment and estimate used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statement revenue recognition product sale we recognize revenue from product sale when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists delivery ha occurred the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured we record product sale net of estimated mandatory and supplemental discount to government payer in addition to discount to private payer and other related charge these are generally referred to gross to net deduction and are recorded in the same period the related sale occur government and other rebate and chargebacks represent the majority of our gross to net deduction and require complex and significant judgment by management estimate are assessed each period and updated to reflect current information government and other rebate and chargebacksgovernment and other rebate and chargebacks include amount paid to payer and healthcare provider in the united state including medicaid rebate aid drug assistance program veteran administration and public health service discount and other rebate well foreign government rebate rebate and chargebacks are based on contractual arrangement or statutory requirement which may vary by product by payer and individual payer plan for qualified program that can purchase our product through wholesaler or other distributor at lower contractual price the wholesaler or distributor charge back to the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual price our consolidated allowance for government and other chargebacks that are payable to our direct customer are classified reduction of account receivable and totaled million of december and million of december our consolidated allowance for government and other rebate that will be paid to party other than our direct customer are recorded in accrued government and other rebate on our consolidated balance sheet and totaled billion of december and billion of december our allowance for government and other rebate and chargebacks are estimated based on product sold historical utilization rate pertinent third party industry information estimated patient population known market event or trend channel inventory data and or other market data we also consider new information regarding change in program regulation and guideline that would impact the amount of the actual rebate and or our expectation regarding future utilization rate for these program we believe that the methodology that we use to estimate our government and other rebate and chargebacks is reasonable and appropriate given the current fact and circumstance however actual result may differ significantly from our estimate during the last three year our actual government rebate and chargebacks claimed for prior period have varied by le than from our estimate the following table summarizes the consolidated activity and ending balance in our government and other rebate and chargebacks account in million accrued government and other rebate and chargebacks balance at beginning of year decrease increase to product sale payment balance at end of yearyear ended december activity related to sale related to sale prior to ended december activity related to sale related to sale prior to decrease in our government and other rebate and chargebacks in compared to wa primarily driven by lower hcv sale contingencieswe are party to various legal action the most significant of these are described in note commitment and contingency legal proceeding of the note to consolidated financial statement included in item of this annual report on form it is not possible to determine the outcome of these matter we recognize accrual for such action to the extent that we conclude that loss is both probable and reasonably estimable we accrue for the best estimate of loss within range however if no estimate in the range is better than any other then we accrue the minimum amount in the range if we determine that loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the possible loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable because of the inherent uncertainty and unpredictability related to these matter accrual are based on what we believe to be the best information available at the time of our assessment including the legal fact and circumstance of the case status of the proceeding applicable law and the view of legal counsel upon the final resolution of such matter it is possible that there may be loss in excess of the amount recorded and such amount could have material adverse effect on our result of operation cash flow or financial position we periodically reassess these matter when additional information becomes available and adjust our estimate and assumption when fact and circumstance indicate the need for any change we did not recognize any accrual for such matter of december and we did not believe loss were probable valuation of intangible assetsin conjunction with our business combination we have recorded intangible asset primarily related to ipr project we had total intangible asset of billion of december compared to billion of december the identifiable intangible asset are measured at their respective fair value of the acquisition date and may be subject to revision within the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date the model used in valuing these intangible asset require the use of significant estimate and assumption including but not limited to estimate of revenue and operating profit related to the product or product candidate the probability of success for unapproved product candidate considering their stage of development the time and resource needed to complete the development and approval of product candidate the life of the potential commercialized product and associated risk including the inherent difficulty and uncertainty in developing product candidate such obtaining fda and other regulatory approval and risk related to the viability of and potential alternative treatment in any future target market we believe the fair value used to record intangible asset acquired in connection with business combination using information known and knowable and are based upon reasonable estimate and assumption given the fact and circumstance of the related valuation date intangible asset related to ipr project are considered to be indefinite lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated effort if and when development is complete which generally occurs if and when regulatory approval to market product is obtained the associated asset would be deemed finite lived and would then be amortized based on their respective estimated useful life at that point in time during the period the asset are considered indefinite lived they are not amortized but are tested for impairment on an annual basis well between annual test if we become aware of any event or change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the ipr project are below their respective carrying amount the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible asset is dependent on assumption such the expected timing or probability of achieving the specified milestone change in projected revenue or change in discount rate significant judgment is employed in determining these assumption and change to our assumption could have significant impact on our result of operation in any given period intangible asset with finite useful life are amortized over their estimated useful life primarily on straight line basis intangible asset with finite useful life are reviewed for impairment when fact or circumstance suggest that the carrying value of these asset may not be recoverable on october in connection with our kite acquisition we acquired intangible asset primarily related to ipr for axicabtagene ciloleucel kite and kte which had an estimated aggregate fair value of billion on october fda approved axicabtagene ciloleucel now known commercially yescarta making it the first car cell therapy for the treatment of adult patient with relapsed or refractory large cell lymphoma after two or more line of systemic therapy which includes diffuse large cell lymphoma transformed follicular lymphoma and primary mediastinal cell lymphoma upon approval we reclassified billion of the purchased ipr finite lived intangible asset we are amortizing this asset over an estimated useful life of year using the straight line method see note acquisition of the note to consolidated financial statement included in item of this annual report on form of december we had indefinite lived intangible asset of billion which consisted of purchased ipr from our acquisition of kite see note acquisition of the note to consolidated financial statement included in item of this annual report on form in the estimated fair value of our ipr related to momelotinib and simtuzumab wa written down to zero due to termination of clinical development of such program and result we recorded impairment charge of million within research and development expense on our consolidated statement of income included in item of this annual report on form provision for income taxeswe estimate our income tax provision including deferred tax asset and liability based on significant management judgment we evaluate the realization of all or portion of our deferred tax asset on quarterly basis we record valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset to the amount that are more likely than not to be realized we consider future taxable income ongoing tax planning strategy and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for valuation allowance if we expect to realize deferred tax asset for which we have previously recorded valuation allowance we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made the valuation allowance wa million of december and million of december the increase of our valuation allowance from december to december wa primarily related to kite we are subject to income tax in the united state and various foreign jurisdiction including ireland due to economic and political condition various country are actively considering and have made change to existing tax law for example the united state recently enacted significant tax reform and certain provision of the new law will significantly affect we can not predict the form or timing of potential legislative change that could have material adverse impact on our result of operation in addition significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income tax on december tax reform wa signed into law in the united state making significant change to the internal revenue code of amended change include but are not limited to corporate tax rate decrease from to effective for tax year beginning after december implementation of modified territorial tax system and repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiary we calculated provisional estimate of the impact from tax reform in our income tax provision in accordance with our interpretation of tax reform and guidance available of the date of this filing result we recorded an estimated billion net charge to income tax expense in the fourth quarter of the period in which tax reform wa enacted this amount includes provisional million deferred tax benefit related to the re measurement of certain deferred tax asset and liability based on the revised rate at which they are expected to reverse in the future and ii provisional billion charge related to the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings determined of december the provisional transition tax charge includes federal net of certain offsetting adjustment related to unrecognized tax benefit state and local and foreign withholding tax on the accumulated foreign earnings which are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested of december in accordance with the sec sab we have determined that the million of the deferred tax benefit recorded in connection with the re measurement of certain deferred tax asset and liability and the billion of current tax expense recorded in connection with the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings are provisional and subject to further adjustment during the measurement period not to exceed one year from the enactment of tax reform given the complexity of tax reform we may be refining our estimate of these provisional amount further guidance is issued from the treasury the sec and the fasb additionally we are continuing to evaluate the accounting policy election required with regard to the tax on global intangible low taxed income the global minimum tax the fasb allows company to adopt policy election to account for the global minimum tax under one of two method account for the global minimum tax component of tax expense in the period in which company is subject to the rule the period cost method or ii account for the global minimum tax in company measurement of deferred tax the deferred method we have not elected method and will only do so after our completion of the analysis of the global minimum tax provision our election method will depend in part on analyzing expected future taxable income inclusion related to global minimum tax under both methodology in order to determine the most appropriate method should we decide to elect the deferred method of accounting for the global minimum tax it is possible that our provisional estimate for re measuring our deferred tax may materially change we will finalize the analysis for the accounting policy election during the measurement period we record liability related to unrecognized tax benefit in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax recognized in an enterprise financial statement by prescribing minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax position taken or expected to be taken in tax return an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax position in any period could have material impact on the result of operation for that period the total unrecognized tax benefit billion at both december and if recognized would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition of december we believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefit will decrease by approximately million in the next month due to potential settlement of tax examination and lapse of statute of limitation we file federal state and foreign income tax return in the united state and in many foreign jurisdiction for federal and california income tax purpose the statute of limitation is open for and onwards for certain acquired entity the statute of limitation is open for all year from inception due to our utilization of their net operating loss and credit carried over from prior year our income tax return are subject to audit by federal state and foreign tax authority we are currently under examination by the irs for the tax year from to and by various state and foreign jurisdiction there are differing interpretation of tax law and

interest dividend amortization of purchase premium and discount realized gain and loss on sale of security and other than temporary decline in the fair value of security if any the cost of security sold is based on the specific identification method we regularly review all of our investment for other than temporary decline in fair value our review includes the consideration of the cause of the impairment including the creditworthiness of the security issuer the number of security in an unrealized loss position the severity and duration of the unrealized loss whether we have the intent to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of their amortized cost basis when we determine that the decline in fair value of an investment is below our accounting basis and the decline is other than temporary we reduce the carrying value of the security we hold and record loss for the amount of such decline marketable and non marketable equity securitieswe record investment in public company available for sale security at fair market value we also invest in equity security of company whose security are not publicly traded and where fair value is not readily available these investment are recorded using either the cost method or the equity method of accounting depending on our ownership percentage

also subject to credit risk from our account receivable related to our product sale the majority of our trade account receivable arises from product sale in the united state europe and japan to date we have not experienced significant loss with respect to the collection of our account receivable we believe that our allowance for doubtful account wa adequate at december certain of the raw material and component that we utilize in our operation are obtained through single supplier certain of the raw material that we utilize in our operation are made at only one facility since the supplier of key component and raw material must be named in new drug application filed with food and drug administration fda for product significant delay can occur if the qualification of new supplier is required if

periodically review the composition of our inventory in order to identify obsolete slow moving or otherwise unsaleable item unsaleable item are observed and there are no alternate us for the inventory we record write down to net realizable value in the period that the impairment is first recognized when future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized based on management judgment we capitalize pre launch inventory cost prior to regulatory approval number of factor are taken into consideration including the current status in the regulatory approval process potential impediment to the approval process such safety or efficacy anticipated initiative that could impact the indication in which the compound will be used viability of commercialization and marketplace trend of december and the amount of pre launch inventory on our consolidated balance sheet wa not significant property plant and equipmentproperty plant and equipment

includes capitalized software we had unamortized capitalized software cost on our consolidated balance sheet of million of december and million of december capitalized interest on construction in progress is included in property plant and equipment interest capitalized in and wa not significant acquisitionswe account for business combination using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that asset acquired including in process research and development ipr project and liability assumed be recorded at their fair value of the acquisition date on our consolidated balance sheet any excess of purchase price over the fair value of net asset acquired is recorded goodwill the determination of estimated fair value requires to make significant estimate and assumption result we may record adjustment to the fair value of asset acquired and liability assumed within the measurement period up to one year from the acquisition date with the corresponding offset to goodwill transaction cost associated with business combination are expensed they are incurred when we determine net asset acquired do not meet the definition of business combination under the acquisition method of accounting acquired ipr is expensed and no goodwill is recorded goodwill and intangible assetsgoodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair value of asset acquired and liability assumed in business combination intangible asset with indefinite useful life are related to purchased ipr project and are measured at their respective fair value of the acquisition date we do not amortize goodwill and intangible asset with indefinite useful life intangible asset related to ipr project are considered to be indefinite lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated effort if and when development is complete which generally occurs if and when regulatory approval to market product is obtained the associated asset are deemed finite lived and are amortized based on their respective estimated useful life at that point in time we test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment on an annual basis and in between annual test if we become aware of any event or change that would indicate the fair value of the asset are below their carrying amount intangible asset with finite useful life are amortized over their estimated useful life primarily on straight line basis and are reviewed for impairment when fact or circumstance suggest that the carrying value of these asset may not be recoverable impairment of long lived asset long lived asset including property plant and equipment and finite lived intangible asset are reviewed for impairment whenever fact or circumstance either internally or externally may suggest that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable should there be an indication of impairment we test for recoverability by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flow expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and it eventual disposition to the carrying amount of the asset or asset group any excess of the carrying value of the asset or asset group over it estimated fair value is recognized an impairment loss currency translation transaction gain and loss and hedging contract non entity operation are recorded in

currency rate at period end foreign currency translation adjustment are recorded component of aoci within stockholder equity foreign currency transaction gain and loss are recorded in other income expense net on our consolidated statement of income net foreign currency transaction gain and loss were immaterial for the year ended december and we hedge portion of our foreign currency exposure related to outstanding monetary asset and liability well forecasted product sale using foreign currency exchange forward and option contract in general the market risk related to these contract is offset by corresponding gain and loss on the hedged transaction the credit risk associated with these contract is driven by change in interest and currency exchange rate and result varies over time by working only with major bank and closely monitoring current market condition we seek to limit the risk that counterparties to these contract may be unable to perform we also seek to limit our risk of loss by entering into contract that permit net settlement at maturity therefore our overall risk of loss in the event of counterparty default is limited to the amount of any unrecognized gain on outstanding contract those contract that have positive fair value at the date of default we do not enter into derivative contract for trading purpose fair value of financial instrument we apply fair value accounting for all financial asset and liability and non financial asset and liability that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statement on recurring basis we define fair value the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date when determining the fair value measurement for asset and liability which are required to be recorded at fair value we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market based risk measurement or assumption that market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability such risk inherent in valuation technique transfer restriction and credit risk derivative financial instrumentswe recognize all derivative instrument either asset or liability at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet change in the fair value of derivative are recorded each period in current earnings or aoci depending on whether derivative is designated part of hedge transaction and if it is the type of hedge transaction we classify the cash flow from these instrument in the same category the cash flow from the hedged item we do not hold or issue derivative instrument for trading or speculative purpose we ass both at inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivative that are used in hedging transaction are highly effective in offsetting the change in cash flow or fair value of the hedged item we also ass hedge ineffectiveness on quarterly basis and record the gain or loss related to the ineffective portion to current earnings to the extent significant if we determine that forecasted transaction is probable of not occurring we discontinue hedge accounting for the affected portion of the hedge instrument and any related unrealized gain or loss on the contract is recognized in other income expense net on our consolidated statement of income income taxesour income tax provision is computed under the liability method deferred tax asset and liability are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of asset and liability using enacted tax rate in effect for the year in which the difference are expected to reverse significant estimate are required in determining our provision for income tax some of these estimate are based on interpretation of applicable tax law or regulation we record liability related to unrecognized tax benefit in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax recognized in an enterprise financial statement by prescribing minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax position taken or expected to be taken in tax return an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax position in any period could have material impact on the result of operation for that

net cash provided by operating activity to other within net cash used in financing activity in january the fasb issued accounting standard update no asu clarifying the definition of business asu

in the first quarter of we are evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statement fair value measurement we determine the fair value of financial and non financial asset and liability using the fair value hierarchy which establishes three level of input that may be used to measure fair value follows level input include quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability level input include observable input other than level input such quoted price for similar asset or liability quoted price for identical or similar asset or liability in market that are not active or other input that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability for our marketable security we review trading activity and pricing of the measurement date when sufficient quoted pricing for identical security is not available we use market pricing and other observable market input for similar security obtained from various third party data provider these input either represent quoted price for similar asset in active market or have been derived from observable market data and level input include unobservable input that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the underlying asset or liability our level asset and liability include those whose fair value measurement are determined using pricing model discounted cash flow methodology or similar valuation technique and significant management judgment or estimation our financial instrument consist primarily of cash and cash equivalent marketable security account receivable foreign currency exchange contract equity security account payable and short term and long term debt cash and cash equivalent marketable security foreign currency exchange contract and equity security are reported at their respective fair value on our consolidated balance sheet short term and long

the patent protection for sofosbuvir taf and cobicistat in the european union could be substantially shortened or eliminated entirely if our patent are revoked and no other european patent are granted covering these compound our exclusivity may be based entirely on regulatory exclusivity granted by the european medicine agency sovaldi ha been granted regulatory exclusivity that will prevent generic sofosbuvir from entering the european union for year following approval of sovaldi or january if we lose patent protection for sofosbuvir prior to our revenue and result of operation could be
