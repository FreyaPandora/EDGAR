risk relating to retail operation overall economic and market condition may adversely affect the general retail environment our concentration in the retail real estate market mean that we are subject to number of factor that could adversely affect the retail environment generally including without limitation change in international national regional and local economic condition tenant bankruptcy and resulting rejection of our lease the impact on our retail tenant and demand for retail space at our property from the increasing use of the internet by retailer and consumer local real estate condition such an oversupply of or reduction in demand for retail space or retail good decrease in rental rate declining real estate value and the availability and creditworthiness of tenant level of consumer spending change in consumer confidence and fluctuation in seasonal spending the willingness of retailer to lease space in our property increased operating cost change in applicable law and regulation including tax environmental safety and zoning perception by consumer of the safety convenience and attractiveness of our property casualty and other natural disaster and the potential for terrorist activity we derive our operating result primarily from retail tenant many of have been and continue to be under degree of economic stress significant deterioration in the creditworthiness of our retail tenant could have material adverse effect on some of our property depend on anchor store or other major tenant to attract shopper and could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more of these anchor store or major tenant our property are typically anchored by department store and other large nationally recognized tenant the value of some of our property could be materially and adversely affected if these anchor or other major tenant fail to comply with their contractual obligation or cease their operation for example among department store and other large store often referred to big box store corporate merger activity typically result in the closure of duplicate or geographically overlapping store location further sustained adverse pressure on the result of our department store and major tenant may have similarly sustained adverse impact upon our own result certain department store and other national retailer have experienced and may continue to experience for the foreseeable future given current macroeconomic uncertainty and le than desirable level of consumer confidence considerable decrease in customer traffic in their retail store increased competition from alternative retail option such those accessible via the internet and other form of pressure on their business model pressure on these department store and national retailer increase their ability to maintain their store meet their obligation both to and to their external lender and supplier withstand takeover attempt by investor or rival or avoid bankruptcy and or liquidation may be impaired and result in closure of their store or their seeking of lease modification with any lease modification could be unfavorable to the lessor and could decrease rent or expense recovery charge other tenant table of content may be entitled to modify the economic or other term of or terminate their existing lease with in the event of such closure if department store or major tenant were to close it store at our property we may experience difficulty and delay and incur significant expense in replacing the tenant well in leasing space in area adjacent to the vacant department store or major tenant at attractive rate or at all additionally department store or major tenant closure may result in decreased customer traffic which could lead to decreased sale at our property if the sale of store operating in our property were to decline significantly due to the closing of anchor store or other national retailer adverse economic condition or other reason tenant may be unable to pay their minimum rent or expense recovery charge in the event of any default by tenant we may not be able to fully recover and or may experience delay and cost in enforcing our right landlord to

operation if tenant file for bankruptcy the tenant may have the right to reject and terminate one or more of it lease with and we can not be sure that it will affirm one or more of it lease and continue to make rental payment to in timely manner bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenant would bar all effort by to collect pre bankruptcy debt from that tenant or from their property unless we receive an order permitting to do so from the bankruptcy court in addition we can not evict tenant solely because of it bankruptcy if lease is assumed by the tenant in bankruptcy all pre bankruptcy balance due under the lease must be paid to in full however if lease is rejected by tenant in bankruptcy we would have general unsecured claim for damage in connection with such balance if bankrupt tenant vacates space it might not do so in timely manner and we might be unable to lease the vacated space during that time at attractive rate or at all furthermore we may be required to incur significant expense in replacing the bankrupt tenant any unsecured claim we hold bankrupt tenant might be paid only to the extent that fund are available and only in the same percentage is paid to all other holder of unsecured claim and there are restriction under bankruptcy law that limit the amount of the claim we can make if lease is rejected result it is likely that we would recover substantially le than the full value of any unsecured claim we hold we continually seek to re lease vacant space resulting from tenant termination the bankruptcy of tenant particularly an anchor tenant or national tenant with multiple location may make the re leasing of their space difficult and costly and it also may be more difficult to lease the remainder of the space at the affected property future tenant bankruptcy may impact our ability to successfully execute our re leasing strategy and could materially and adversely affect we face wide range of competition that could affect

which could restrict our ability to dispose of the property even though the sale might otherwise be desirable risk relating to debt and the financial market we have substantial debt burden that could affect our future operation of december our consolidated mortgage and unsecured indebtedness excluding related premium discount and debt issuance cost totaled billion result of this indebtedness we are required to use substantial portion of our cash flow for debt service including selected repayment at scheduled maturity which limit our ability to use those cash flow to fund the growth of our business we are also subject to the risk normally associated with debt financing including the risk that our cash flow from operation will be insufficient to meet required debt service or that we will

we obtain since we depend primarily on debt financing to fund the growth of our business an adverse change in our credit rating including actual change and change in outlook or even the initiation of review of our credit rating that could result in an adverse change could have material adverse effect on the agreement that govern our indebtedness contain various covenant that impose restriction on that might affect our ability to operate freely we have variety of unsecured debt including the credit facility and secured property level debt certain of the agreement that govern our indebtedness contain covenant including among other thing limitation on our ability to incur secured and unsecured indebtedness sell all or substantially all of our asset and engage in merger and certain acquisition in addition certain of the agreement that govern our indebtedness contain financial covenant that require to maintain certain financial ratio including certain coverage ratio these covenant may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiative or certain transaction that might otherwise be advantageous to in addition our ability to comply with these provision might be affected by event beyond our control failure to comply with any of our financing covenant could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could accelerate the related indebtedness well other of our indebtedness which could have material adverse effect on our hedging interest rate protection arrangement may not effectively limit our interest rate risk we selectively manage our exposure to interest rate risk by combination of interest rate protection agreement to effectively fix or cap all or portion of our variable rate debt in addition we refinance fixed rate debt at time when we believe rate and other term are appropriate our effort to manage these exposure may not be successful our use of interest rate hedging arrangement to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose to additional risk including risk that counterparty to hedging arrangement may fail to honor it obligation or that we could be required to fund our contractual payment obligation under such arrangement in relatively large amount or on short notice developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate from risk associated with interest rate fluctuation there can be no assurance that our hedging activity will have the desired beneficial impact on our result of operation liquidity or financial condition termination of these hedging agreement typically involves cost such transaction fee or breakage cost risk relating to income tax simon and certain subsidiary of the operating partnership have elected to be taxed reit in the united state and certain international operation also are structured to be taxed in manner similar to the reit structure the failure to maintain simon or these subsidiary qualification reit or change in local tax law or regulation in certain of our international operation could result in adverse tax consequence we are subject to certain income based tax both domestically and internationally and other tax including state and local tax franchise tax and withholding tax on dividend from certain of our international investment we currently follow local tax law and regulation in various domestic and international jurisdiction should these law or regulation change the amount of tax we pay may increase accordingly in the united state simon and certain subsidiary of the operating partnership have elected to be taxed reit under section through of the internal revenue code we believe simon and these subsidiary have been organized and operated in manner which allows them to qualify for taxation reit under the internal revenue code we intend to continue to operate in this manner however qualification and taxation reit depend upon the ability of simon and these subsidiary to satisfy several requirement some of which are outside our control including test related to our annual operating result asset diversification distribution level and diversity of stock ownership the various reit qualification test required by the internal revenue code are highly technical and complex accordingly there can be no assurance that simon or any of these subsidiary ha operated in accordance with these requirement or will continue to operate in manner so to qualify or remain qualified reit if simon or any of these subsidiary fail to comply with those provision simon or any such subsidiary may be subject to monetary penalty or ultimately to possible disqualification reit if such event occur and if available relief provision do not apply table of content simon or any such subsidiary will not be allowed deduction for distribution to stockholder in computing taxable income simon or any such subsidiary will be subject to corporate level income tax on taxable income at the corporate rate and unless entitled to relief under relevant statutory provision simon or any such subsidiary will also be disqualified from treatment reit for the four taxable year following the year during which qualification wa lost any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for among other thing our operation and distribution to stockholder in addition if simon fails to qualify reit it will not be required to make distribution to our stockholder moreover failure by any subsidiary of the operating partnership that ha elected to be taxed reit to qualify reit would also cause simon to fail to qualify reit and the same adverse consequence would apply to it and it stockholder failure by simon or any of these subsidiary to qualify reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital which could materially and adversely affect the tax imposed on reit engaging in prohibited transaction may limit our ability to engage in transaction which would be treated sale for federal income tax purpose reit net income from prohibited transaction is subject to penalty tax in general prohibited transaction are sale or other disposition of property other than foreclosure property held primarily for sale to customer in the ordinary course of business although we do not intend to hold any property that would

determination and no guarantee can be given that the irs would agree with our characterization of our property or that we will always be able to make use of the available safe harbor reit distribution requirement could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our business plan in order for simon and certain subsidiary of the operating partnership to qualify to be taxed reit and assuming that certain other requirement are also satisfied simon and each such subsidiary generally must distribute at least of their respective reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividend paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain to their respective equity holder each year to this point simon and each such subsidiary have historically distributed at least of taxable income and thereby avoided income tax altogether to the extent that simon or any such subsidiary satisfies this distribution requirement and qualifies for taxation reit but distributes le than of it reit taxable income simon or any such subsidiary will be subject to federal corporate income tax on it undistributed net taxable income and could be subject to nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that is distributed to equity holder in calendar year is le than the required minimum distribution amount specified under federal income tax law we intend to make distribution to the equity holder of simon and the aforementioned subsidiary of the operating partnership to comply with the reit requirement of the internal revenue code from time to time simon and the aforementioned subsidiary of the operating partnership might generate taxable income greater than their respective cash flow result of difference in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditure the creation of reserve or required debt or amortization payment if simon and these subsidiary do not have other fund available in these situation simon and these subsidiary could be required to access capital on unfavorable term the receipt of which can not be assured sell asset at disadvantageous price distribute amount that would otherwise be invested in future acquisition capital expenditure or repayment of debt or make taxable distribution of capital stock or debt security to make distribution sufficient to enable them to pay enough of their respective reit taxable income to satisfy the reit distribution requirement and avoid corporate income tax and the excise tax in particular year these alternative could increase cost or reduce our equity further amount distributed will not be available to fund the growth of our business thus compliance with the reit requirement may adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our business plan table of content complying with reit requirement might cause to forego otherwise attractive acquisition opportunity or liquidate otherwise attractive investment to qualify to be taxed reit for federal income tax purpose simon and certain subsidiary of the operating partnership must ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least of the value of their

any such subsidiary must correct the failure within day after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provision to avoid losing it reit qualification and suffering adverse tax consequence result we might be required to liquidate or forego otherwise attractive investment these action could have the effect of reducing our income and amount available for distribution to equity holder in addition to the asset test set forth above to qualify to be taxed reit simon and these subsidiary must continually satisfy test concerning among other thing the source of their respective income the amount they distribute to equity holder and the ownership of their respective share we might be unable to pursue investment that would be otherwise advantageous to in order to satisfy the source of income or asset diversification requirement for qualifying reit thus compliance with the reit requirement may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investment

various other assumption believed to be reasonable under the circumstance these judgment affect the reported amount of asset and liability disclosure of contingent asset and liability at the date of the financial statement and the reported amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period if our judgment or interpretation of the fact and circumstance relating to various transaction had been different it is possible that different accounting policy would have been applied resulting in different presentation of our financial statement from time to time we reevaluate our estimate and assumption in the event estimate or assumption prove to be different from actual result adjustment are made in subsequent period to reflect more current information below is discussion of accounting policy that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimate about matter that are inherently uncertain for summary of our significant accounting policy see note of the note to the consolidated financial statement we lessor retain substantially all of the risk and benefit of ownership of the investment property and account for our lease operating lease we accrue minimum rent on straight line basis over the term of their respective lease substantially all of our retail tenant are also required to pay overage rent based on sale over stated base amount during the lease year we recognize overage rent only when each tenant sale exceed it sale threshold we review investment property for impairment on property by property basis whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of investment property may not be recoverable these circumstance include but are not limited to decline in property cash flow occupancy or comparable sale per square foot we measure any impairment of investment property when the estimated undiscounted operating income depreciation and amortization plus it residual value is le than the carrying value of the property to the extent impairment ha occurred we charge to income the excess of carrying value of the property over it estimated fair value we may decide to sell property that are held for use and the sale price of these property may differ from their carrying value we also review our investment including investment in unconsolidated entity if event or circumstance change indicating that the carrying amount of our investment may not be recoverable we will record an impairment charge if we determine that decline in the fair value of the investment below carrying value is other than temporary change in economic and operating condition that occur subsequent to our review of recoverability of investment property and other investment could impact the assumption used in that assessment and could result in future charge to earnings if assumption regarding those investment differ from actual result to maintain simon status reit we must distribute at least of reit taxable income in any given year and meet certain asset and income test we monitor our business and transaction that may potentially impact simon reit status in the unlikely event that we fail to maintain simon reit status and available relief provision do not apply we would be required to pay federal income tax at regular corporate income tax rate during the period simon did not qualify reit if simon lost it reit status it could not elect to be taxed reit for four taxable year following the year during which qualification wa lost unless it failure wa due to reasonable cause and certain other condition were met result failing to maintain reit status would result in significant increase in the income tax expense recorded and paid during those period table of content we make estimate part of our valuation of the purchase price of acquisition including the component of excess investment in joint venture to the various component of the acquisition based upon the relative fair value of each component the most significant component of our valuation are typically the determination of relative fair value to the building if vacant land and market value of in place lease in the case of the fair value of building and fair value of land and other intangible our estimate of the value of these component will affect the amount of depreciation or amortization we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term in the case of the market value of in place lease we make our best estimate of the tenant ability to pay rent based upon the tenant operating performance at the property including the competitive position of the property in it market well sale psf rent psf and overall occupancy cost for the tenant in place at the acquisition date our assumption affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired in place lease variety of cost are incurred in the development and leasing of property after determination is made to capitalize cost it is allocated to the specific component of project that is benefited determination of when development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves judgment the cost of land and building under development include specifically identifiable cost the capitalized cost include pre construction cost essential to the development of the property development cost construction cost interest cost real estate tax salary and related cost and other cost incurred during the period of

operating partnership partnership agreement to exchange their unit for share of common stock or cash selected by simon the sole general partner accordingly we classify unit held by limited partner in permanent equity because simon may elect to issue share of common stock to limited partner exercising their exchange right rather than using cash under the operating partnership partnership agreement the operating partnership is required to redeem unit held by simon only when simon ha repurchased share of common stock we classify unit held by simon in permanent equity because the decision to

accounting pronouncement in may the financial accounting standard board fasb issued accounting standard update asu revenue from contract with customer asu amends the existing accounting standard for revenue recognition the new standard provides accounting guidance for all revenue arising from contract with customer and affect all entity that enter into contract to provide good or service to their customer the guidance also provides model for the measurement and recognition of gain and loss on the sale of certain nonfinancial asset such property including real estate our revenue impacted by this standard primarily include management development leasing and financing fee revenue for service performed related to various domestic joint venture that we manage licensing fee earned from

similar investment of the same issuer this guidance will be applied prospectively upon the occurrence of an event which establishes fair value to all other investment we currently account for using the cost method in february the fasb issued asu lease which will result in lessee recognizing most leased asset and corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet lessor accounting will remain substantially similar to the current accounting however certain refinement were made to conform the standard with the recently issued revenue recognition guidance in asu specifically related to the allocation and recognition of contract consideration earned from lease and non lease revenue component asu also limit the capitalization of leasing cost to initial direct cost which will likely result in reduction to our capitalized leasing cost and an increase in expense though the amount of such change is highly dependent upon the leasing compensation structure in place at the time of adoption substantially all of our revenue and the revenue of our equity method investment are earned from arrangement that are within the scope of asu upon adoption of asu consideration related to non lease component identified in our lease arrangement will be accounted for using the guidance in asu which we have determined would necessitate that we reallocate consideration received under many of our lease arrangement between the lease and non lease component ii result in recognizing revenue allocated to our primary non lease component consideration received from fixed common area maintenance arrangement on straight line basis and iii require separate presentation of revenue recognized from lease and non lease component on our statement of operation however on january the fasb issued an exposure draft that proposes targeted improvement to asu which include creating practical expedient that would provide lessor an option not to separate lease and non lease component when certain criterion are met and instead account for those component single component if the fasb adopts this proposed update we believe we would meet the criterion to account for lease and non lease component single component which would alleviate the requirement upon adoption of asu that we reallocate or separately present lease and non lease component we would however recognize consideration received from fixed common area maintenance arrangement on straight line basis further upon adoption of asu lease of land and other arrangement where we are the lessee will be recognized on our balance sheet undiscounted future minimum lease payment due under long term ground lease with termination date which range from to excluding extension option over the entire term of these lease total approximately

under the standard in february the fasb issued asu other income gain and loss from the derecognition of nonfinancial asset which clarifies the scope and application of accounting standard codification on the sale or transfer of nonfinancial asset and in substance asset to noncustomers including partial sale the standard generally aligns the measurement of retained interest in nonfinancial asset with that of retained interest in business it also eliminates the use of the carryover basis for contribution of real estate into joint venture where control of the real estate is not retained which will result in the recognition of gain or loss upon contribution we adopted the standard using the modified retrospective approach on january and there wa no cumulative effect adjustment to recognize in august the fasb issued asu derivative and hedging topic targeted improvement to accounting for hedging activity which introduced amendment to the hedge accounting model to allow for better alignment with risk management practice in addition to simplifying the hedge accounting model the provision may permit more risk management strategy to qualify for hedge accounting including interest
