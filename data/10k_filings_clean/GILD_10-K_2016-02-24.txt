to launch generic version of ranexa on february patent protection and certain challenge patent and other proprietary right are very important to our business if we have properly drafted and enforceable patent it can be more difficult for our competitor to use our technology to create competitive product and more difficult for our competitor to obtain patent that prevents from using technology we create part of our business strategy we actively seek patent protection both in the united state and internationally and file additional patent application when appropriate to cover improvement in our compound product and technology patent covering certain of the active pharmaceutical ingredient of truvada atripla stribild complera eviplera genvoya vitekta emtriva letairis and

begin to run prior to the commercial sale of the related product the commercial value of the patent may be limited however we may be able to apply for patent term extension or supplementary protection certificate in some country for example extension for the patent or supplementary protection certificate on many of our product have been granted in the united state and in number of european country compensating in part for delay in obtaining marketing approval similar patent term extension may be available for other product that we are developing but we can not be certain we will obtain them in some country it is also important that we do not infringe the valid patent of third party if we infringe the valid patent of third party we may be prevented from commercializing product or may be required to obtain license from these third party we may not be able to obtain alternative technology or any required license on reasonable term or at all if we fail to obtain these license or alternative technology we may be unable to develop or commercialize some or all of our product for example we are aware of body of patent that may relate to our operation of letairis education and access program leap our restricted distribution program designed to support letairis and we are aware of patent and patent application owned by other party that may claim to cover the use of sofosbuvir and the use of the combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir because patent application are confidential for period of time until patent is issued we may not know if our competitor have filed patent application for technology covered by our pending application or if we were the first to invent or first to file an application directed toward the technology that is the subject of our patent application competitor may have filed patent application or received patent and may obtain additional patent and proprietary right that block or compete with our product in addition if competitor file patent application covering our technology we may have to participate in interference derivation proceeding or litigation to determine the right to patent litigation and interference derivation proceeding are unpredictable and expensive such that even if we are ultimately successful our result of operation may be adversely affected by such event patent relating to pharmaceutical biopharmaceutical and biotechnology product compound and process such those that cover our existing compound product and process and those that we will likely file in the future do not always provide complete or adequate protection future litigation or other proceeding regarding the enforcement or validity of our existing patent or any future patent could result in the invalidation of our patent or substantially reduce their protection from time to time certain individual or entity may challenge our patent our pending patent application and the patent application filed by our collaborative partner may not result in the issuance of any patent or may result in patent that do not provide adequate protection result we may not be able to prevent third party from developing compound or product that are closely related to those which we have developed or are developing in addition certain country in south america africa and asia including brazil and china do not provide effective enforcement of our patent and third party manufacturer may be able to sell generic version of our product in those country litigation related to sofosbuvir in january we acquired pharmasset inc pharmasset through the acquisition we acquired sofosbuvir nucleotide analog that act to inhibit the replication of the hepatitis virus hcv in december we received food and drug administration fda approval of sofosbuvir now known commercially sovaldi in october we also received approval of the fixed dose combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir ldv sof now known commercially harvoni we have received number of contractual and intellectual property claim regarding sofosbuvir we have carefully considered these claim both prior to and following the acquisition and believe they are without merit we can not predict the ultimate outcome of such claim we own patent and patent application that claim sofosbuvir sovaldi chemical entity and it metabolite and the fixed dose combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir harvoni third party may have or may obtain right to patent that allegedly could be used to prevent or attempt to prevent from commercializing sovaldi or harvoni for example we are aware of patent and patent application owned by other party that have been or may in the future be alleged by such party to cover the use of sovaldi and harvoni we can not predict the ultimate outcome of intellectual property claim related to sovaldi or harvoni we have spent and will continue to spend significant resource defending these claim if third party successfully obtain valid and enforceable patent and successfully prove infringement of those patent by sovaldi and or harvoni we could be prevented from selling these product unless we were able to obtain license under such patent such license may not be available on commercially reasonable term or at all proceeding and litigation with idenix pharmaceutical inc idenix in february we received notice that the patent and trademark office uspto declared interference no first idenix interference between our patent no the patent and idenix pending patent application no an interference is proceeding before the uspto designed to determine who wa the first to invent the subject matter claimed by both party in january the uspto patent trial and appeal board ptab determined that pharmasset and not idenix wa the first to invent the compound in dispute and accordingly gilead prevailed in the first idenix interference idenix ha appealed the ptab decision to the district court for the district of delaware in december after receiving our request to do the uspto declared interference no second idenix interference between our pending patent application no and idenix patent no the patent the patent is related to the idenix patent application at issue in the first idenix interference and includes claim directed to method of treating hcv with nucleoside compound the purpose of the second idenix interference wa to determine who wa first to invent the claimed method of treating hcv with compound similar to those which were involved in the first idenix interference in march the ptab determined that pharmasset and not idenix wa the first to invent the claimed method of treating hcv idenix appealed this decision in both the district court for the district of delaware and the court of appeal for the federal circuit cafc we have filed motion to dismiss the appeal in delaware and will respond to the appeal filed in the cafc we believe that the idenix claim involved in the first and second idenix interference and similar and foreign patent claiming the same compound metabolite and us thereof are invalid result we filed an impeachment action in the federal court of canada to invalidate idenix canadian patent no the patent which is the canadian patent that corresponds to the patent idenix asserted that the commercialization of sovaldi in canada will infringe it patent and that our canadian patent no corresponding to the patent involved in the first idenix interference is invalid trial on these issue wa held in january and february and in november the federal court of canada rendered it public decision holding that idenix patent is invalid and that gilead patent is valid in the same month idenix appealed the court decision we filed similar legal action in norway in the oslo district court seeking to invalidate idenix norwegian patent corresponding to the patent in september idenix filed an invalidation action in the norwegian proceeding against our norwegian patent no patent which corresponds to gilead patent in march the norwegian court found all claim in the idenix norwegian patent to be invalid and upheld the validity of all claim in the challenged gilead patent in april idenix appealed the march decision to the norwegian court of appeal the appeal hearing from the march decision took place in february in january we filed legal action in the federal court of australia seeking to invalidate idenix australian patent corresponding to the patent in april idenix asserted that the commercialization of sovaldi in australia will infringe it australian patent corresponding to the patent month long trial wa completed in october in sydney decision is pending in march the european patent office epo granted idenix european patent no the patent which corresponds to the patent the same day that the patent wa granted we filed an opposition with the epo seeking to revoke the patent an opposition hearing wa held in february and the epo ruled in our favor and revoked the patent in march idenix also initiated infringement proceeding against in the united kingdom uk germany and france alleging that the commercialization of sovaldi would infringe the uk german and french counterpart of the patent trial wa held in the uk in october to determine the issue of infringement and validity of the idenix uk patent in december the high court of justice of england and wale uk court invalidated all challenged claim of the patent on multiple ground the uk court ha granted idenix permission to appeal the december judgment the appeal of the uk court decision is scheduled for july in march the german court in düsseldorf determined that the idenix patent wa highly likely to be invalid and stayed the infringement proceeding pending the outcome of the opposition hearing held by the epo in february idenix ha not appealed this decision of the german court staying the proceeding upon idenix request the french proceeding have been stayed idenix ha not been awarded patent corresponding to the patent in japan or china in the event such patent are issued we expect to challenge them in proceeding similar to those we invoked in other country in december idenix universita degli studi di cagliari udsg centre national de la recherche scientifique and université montpellier ii sued in district court for the district of delaware alleging that the commercialization of sofosbuvir will infringe the patent and that an interference exists between the patent and our patent no also in december idenix and udsg sued in the district court for the district of massachusetts that the commercialization of sofosbuvir will infringe patent no and in june the court transferred the massachusetts litigation to the district court for the district of delaware the district court ha set trial date in october and december for resolution of these issue decision by the district court may be appealed by either party to the cafc idenix wa acquired by merck in august while the acquisition not change our view of the lack of merit in the claim made by idenix merck ha greater resource than idenix and may therefore choose to fund the litigation at higher level than idenix litigation with merckin august merck contacted requesting that we pay royalty on the sale of sofosbuvir and obtain license to patent no and which it co owns with isi pharmaceutical inc in august we filed lawsuit in the district court for the northern district of california seeking declaratory judgment that the merck patent are invalid and not infringed merck patent no and cover compound which do not include but may relate to sofosbuvir during patent prosecution merck amended it patent application in an attempt to cover compound related to sofosbuvir if the court determines that merck patent are valid and that we have infringed those claim we may be required to obtain license from and pay royalty to merck to commercialize sofosbuvir the court ha set trial date of march for this lawsuit either party may appeal decision by the district court to the cafc litigation with abbvie inc abbvie abbvie ha obtained patent no and abbvie patent which purport to cover the use of combination of ldv sof or harvoni for the treatment of hcv gilead is aware that abbvie ha pending patent application in the united state and granted and pending application in other country we own published and pending patent application directed to the use of combination for the treatment of hcv and specifically to the combination of ldv sof certain of our application were filed before the abbvie patent for this reason and others we believe the abbvie patent are invalid accordingly in december we filed lawsuit in the district court for the district of delaware seeking declaratory judgment that the abbvie patent are invalid and unenforceable well other relief we believe that abbott laboratory inc and abbvie conspired to eliminate competition in the hcv market by falsely representing to the uspto that they and not gilead invented method of treating hcv using combination of ldv sof in february and march abbvie responded to our lawsuit by also filing two lawsuit in the district court for the district of delaware alleging that our fixed dose combination of ldv sof will infringe it patent all of those lawsuit have been consolidated into single action in the united state either party may appeal decision by the district court to the cafc the abbvie patent have not blocked or delayed the commercialization of our combination product in the united state canada or europe we do not expect any other foreign patent to block or delay the commercialization around the world the court ha set trial date of september for this lawsuit additionally abbvie ha obtained patent no which purport to cover solid oral dosage form containing ledipasvir accordingly in may we filed lawsuit in the district court for the district of delaware seeking declaratory judgment that abbvie patent is invalid well other relief we do not expect abbvie patent to block the commercialization of our combination product the court ha set trial date of july in august we brought an impeachment action seeking declaration that abbvie canadian patent no patent which purport to cover the use of combination of ldv sof for the treatment of hcv is invalid on the same day abbvie brought an infringement action which asserts that commercialization of harvoni in canada will infringe it patent the impeachment action ha been stayed and we have counterclaimed for invalidity

february several party filed opposition in the european patent office requesting revocation of our granted european patent covering sofosbuvir that expires in while we are confident in the strength of our sofosbuvir patent we can not predict the ultimate outcome of these opposition if we are unsuccessful in defending these opposition some or all of our patent claim may be narrowed or revoked and the patent protection for sofosbuvir in europe could be substantially shortened or eliminated entirely if the sofosbuvir patent is revoked and no other european patent are granted covering sofosbuvir our exclusivity will be based entirely on regulatory exclusivity granted by the european medicine agency ema sovaldi ha been granted regulatory exclusivity that will prevent generic sofosbuvir from entering the european union for year following approval of sovaldi or january if we lose exclusivity for sovaldi prior to our expected revenue and result of operation could be negatively impacted for

timely manner and may be unable to manufacture ambisome to meet market need we utilize our cork ireland facility primarily for solid dose tablet manufacturing of certain of our antiviral product well product packaging activity we package and label drug product for harvoni sovaldi truvada atripla stribild complera eviplera viread genvoya tybost and vitekta and label hepsera and emtriva at our facility in cork ireland we also perform quality control testing final labeling and secondary packaging of both ambisome and cayston and final release of many of our product for the european union and elsewhere at this facility we distribute our product to the european union and other international market from our dublin ireland site at our edmonton alberta facility in canada we carry out process research and scale up of our clinical development candidate manufacture api for both investigational and commercial product and conduct chemical development activity to improve existing commercial manufacturing process we also manufacture the api of letairis and hepsera at our edmonton site our oceanside california facility is designed and equipped to produce biologic compound for toxicological phase and phase clinical study we use the facility for the process development and manufacture of simtuzumab an investigational monoclonal antibody candidate bulk drug substance an investigational mab inhibitor and other biologics party manufacturer our third party manufacturer and corporate partner are independent entity who are subject to their own unique operational and financial risk which are out of our control if we or any of these third party manufacturer or corporate partner fail to perform required this could impair our ability to deliver our product on timely basis or receive royalty or cause delay in our clinical trial and application for regulatory approval further we may have to write the cost of manufacturing any batch that fails to pas quality inspection or meet regulatory approval to the extent these risk materialize and affect their performance obligation to our financial result may be adversely affected in addition we our third party manufacturer and our corporate partner may only be able to produce some of our product at one or limited number of facility and therefore have limited manufacturing capacity for certain product we believe the technology we use to manufacture our product is proprietary for product manufactured by our third party contract manufacturer we have disclosed all necessary aspect of this technology to enable them to manufacture the product for we have agreement with these third party manufacturer that are intended to restrict these manufacturer from using or revealing this technology but we can not be certain that these third party manufacturer will comply with these restriction in addition these third party manufacturer could develop their own technology related to the work they perform for that we may need to manufacture our product we could be required to enter into additional agreement with these third party manufacturer if we want to use that technology or allow another manufacturer to use that technology the third party manufacturer could refuse to allow to use their technology or could demand term to use their technology that are not acceptable to regulation of manufacturing process the manufacturing process for pharmaceutical product is highly regulated and regulator may shut manufacturing facility that they believe do not comply with regulation we our third party manufacturer and our corporate partner are subject to current good manufacturing practice which are extensive regulation governing manufacturing process stability testing record keeping and quality standard defined by fda and the european medicine agency ema similar regulation are in effect in other country our manufacturing operation are subject to routine inspection by regulatory agency for example in we received letter from fda related to the extent of method revalidations being conducted stability program oversight audit trail review data management and quality management system gap we completed and filed our response to these observation with fda if we are unable to remedy the deficiency cited by fda or to the extent there are additional deficiency cited by fda in future inspection our currently marketed product and the timing of regulatory approval of product in development could be adversely affected further there is risk that regulatory agency in other country where marketing application are pending will undertake similar additional review or apply heightened standard of review which could delay the regulatory approval for product in those country if approval of any of our product candidate were delayed or if production of our marketed product wa interrupted our anticipated revenue and our stock price would be adversely affected access to supply and material we need access to certain supply and product to manufacture our product if we are unable to purchase sufficient quantity of these material or find suitable alternate material in timely manner our development effort for our product candidate may be delayed or our ability to manufacture our product would be limited which would limit our ability to generate revenue for example significant portion of the raw material and intermediate used to manufacture our antiviral product harvoni sovaldi truvada atripla stribild complera eviplera viread genvoya emtriva tybost and vitekta are supplied by china based company result an international trade dispute between china and the united state or any other action by the chinese government that would limit or prevent chinese company from supplying these material would adversely affect our ability to manufacture and supply our hiv and hcv product to meet market need and have material and adverse effect on our operating result seasonal operation and backlog our worldwide product sale do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality for the most part we operate in market characterized by short lead time and the absence of significant backlog we do not believe that backlog information is material to our business whole government regulation our operation and activity are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government authority in the united state and other country in the united state the european union and other country drug are subject to rigorous federal and state statute and regulation govern the testing manufacture safety efficacy labeling storage record keeping approval advertising and promotion of our product result of these regulation product development and product approval process are very expensive and time consuming country regulatory agency such fda in the united state and european medicine agency for the european union must approve drug before it can be sold in the respective country or country the general process for drug approval in the united state is summarized below many other country including country in the european union and japan have very similar regulatory structure preclinical testing before we can test drug candidate in human we must study the drug in laboratory experiment and in animal to generate data to support the drug candidate potential benefit and safety we submit this data to fda in an investigational new drug ind application seeking it approval to test the compound in human clinical trial if fda accepts the ind the drug candidate can then be studied in human clinical trial to determine if the drug candidate is safe and effective these clinical trial involve three separate phase that often overlap can take many year and are very expensive these three phase which are subject to considerable regulation are follows phase the drug candidate is given to small number of healthy human control subject or patient suffering from the indicated disease to test for safety dose tolerance pharmacokinetics metabolism distribution and excretion phase the drug candidate is given to limited patient population to determine the effect of the drug candidate in treating the disease the best dose of the drug candidate and the possible side effect and safety risk of the drug candidate it is not uncommon for drug candidate that appears promising in phase clinical trial to fail in the more rigorous phase clinical trial phase if drug candidate appears to be effective and safe in phase clinical trial phase clinical trial are commenced to confirm those result phase clinical trial are conducted over longer term involve significantly larger population are conducted at numerous site in different geographic region and are carefully designed to provide reliable and conclusive data regarding the safety and benefit of drug candidate it is not uncommon for drug candidate that appears promising in phase clinical trial to fail in the more rigorous and extensive phase clinical trial fda approval process when we believe that the data from our clinical trial show an adequate level of safety and efficacy we submit the appropriate filing usually in the form of an nda or supplemental nda with fda seeking approval to sell the drug candidate for particular use fda may hold public hearing where an independent advisory committee of expert advisor asks additional question and make recommendation regarding the drug candidate this committee make recommendation to fda that is not binding but is generally followed by fda if fda agrees that the compound ha met the required level of safety and efficacy for particular use it will allow to sell the drug candidate in the united state for that use it is not unusual however for fda to reject an application because it belief that the drug candidate is not safe enough or efficacious enough or because it doe not believe that the data submitted is reliable or conclusive at any point in this process the development of drug candidate can be stopped for number of reason including safety concern and lack of treatment benefit we can not be certain that any clinical trial that we are currently conducting or any that we conduct in the future will be completed successfully or within any specified time period we may choose or fda may require to delay or suspend our clinical trial at any time if it appears that the patient are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or if the drug candidate doe not appear to have sufficient treatment benefit fda may also require phase non registrational study to explore scientific question to further characterize safety and efficacy during commercial use of our drug fda may also require to provide additional data or information improve our manufacturing process procedure or facility or may require extensive surveillance to monitor the safety or benefit of our product candidate if it determines that our filing doe not contain adequate evidence of the safety and benefit of the drug in addition even if fda approves drug it could limit the us of the drug fda can withdraw approval if it doe not believe that we are complying with regulatory standard or if problem are uncovered or occur after approval addition to obtaining fda approval for each drug we obtain fda approval of the manufacturing facility for any drug we sell including those of company who manufacture our drug for all of these facility are subject to periodic inspection by fda fda must also approve foreign establishment that manufacture product to be sold in the united state and these facility are subject to periodic regulatory inspection our manufacturing facility located in california including our oceanside and san dimas facility also must be licensed by the state of california in compliance with local regulatory requirement our manufacturing facility located in canada including our edmonton alberta facility and our facility located near dublin and in cork ireland also must obtain local license and permit in compliance with local regulatory requirement drug that treat serious or life threatening disease and condition that are not adequately addressed by existing drug and for which the development program is designed to address the unmet medical need may be designated fast track candidate by fda and may be eligible for accelerated and priority review drug for the treatment of hiv infection that are designated for use under the president emergency plan for aid relief may also qualify for an expedited or priority review harvoni sovaldi truvada atripla stribild complera viread genvoya and zydelig received accelerated approval and priority review drug receiving accelerated approval must be monitored in post marketing clinical trial in order to confirm the safety and benefit of the drug drug are also subject to extensive regulation outside of the united state in the european union there is centralized approval procedure that authorizes marketing of product in all country of the european union which includes most major country in europe if this centralized approval procedure is not used approval in one country of the european union can be used to obtain approval in another country of the european union under one of two simplified application process the mutual recognition procedure or the decentralized procedure both of which rely on the principle of mutual recognition after receiving regulatory approval through any of the european registration procedure separate pricing and reimbursement approval are also required in most country the european union also ha requirement for approval of manufacturing facility for all product that are approved for sale by the european regulatory authority pricing and reimbursementsuccessful commercialization of our product depends in part on the availability of governmental and third party payer reimbursement for the cost of such product and related treatment in the market where we sell our product government health authority private health insurer and other organization generally provide reimbursement in the united state the european union japan and other significant or potentially significant market for our product and product candidate government authority and third party payer are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical product and service result significant portion of our sale of the majority of our product are subject to substantial discount and rebate obligation in the united state state aid drug assistance program adaps which purchase significant portion of our hiv product rely on federal supplemental federal and state funding to help fund purchase of our product if federal and state fund are not available in amount sufficient to support the number of patient that rely on adaps sale of our hiv product could be negatively impacted which would reduce our revenue in prior quarter because of the insufficiency of federal and state fund and many state reduced eligibility criterion we saw an increase in the number of patient on state adap waitlists and we may see similar increase in future period result of any reduction in federal and state adap support until these patient are enrolled in an adap they generally receive free product from industry supported patient assistance program or are unable to access treatment the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the united state and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement control in the european union will put additional pressure on product pricing reimbursement and usage which may adversely affect our product sale and profitability these pressure can arise from rule and practice of managed care group judicial decision and governmental law and regulation related to medicare medicaid and healthcare reform pharmaceutical reimbursement policy and pricing in general we continue to experience global pricing pressure on our hcv product which often result in increase in the amount of discount required on our product or delayed reimbursement which could negatively impact our future product sale and result of operation also private and public payer can choose to exclude harvoni or sovaldi from their formulary coverage or limit the type of patient for whom coverage will be provided which could negatively impact the demand for and revenue of harvoni and sovaldi any change in the formulary coverage reimbursement level or discount or rebate offered on our hcv product to payer may impact our anticipated revenue we expect pricing pressure in the hcv market to continue see also our risk factor substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sale of product to treat hcv and hiv if we are unable to maintain or continue increasing sale of these product our result of operation may be adversely affected july we received letter from the senate committee on finance senate committee requesting information and supporting documentation from related to sovaldi and the pricing of sovaldi in the united state the letter raised concern about our approach to pricing sovaldi it affordability and it impact on federal government spending and public health in december the senate committee released the result of the investigation which alleged that we engaged in revenue driven pricing strategy in setting sovaldi price gilead disagrees with many of the conclusion in the report in january we received letter from the massachusetts attorney general that their office is considering whether our pricing of sovaldi and harvoni may constitute an unfair trade practice in violation of massachusetts law in february the massachusetts attorney general office served with civil investigative demand requesting that we produce document related to our hcv product it is possible that the result of the senate committee investigation and any action taken by the massachusetts attorney general or other state government could result in negative publicity or other negative action that could harm our reputation reduce demand for harvoni sovaldi or other sofosbuvir containing product and or reduce coverage of harvoni sovaldi or other sofosbuvir containing product including by federal health care program such medicare and medicaid and state health care program if any or all of these event occur our business and stock price could be materially and adversely affected in country outside the united state the success of our commercialized product and any other product candidate we may develop will depend largely on obtaining and maintaining government reimbursement because in many country patient are unlikely to use prescription drug that are not reimbursed by their government recently many country in the european union have increased the level of discounting required on our product and these effort could continue country attempt to manage healthcare expenditure especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crisis experienced by many country in the european union cost containment pressure in the european union especially in southern europe could lead to delay in the treatment of patient and also delay pricing approval by month or more which could negatively impact the commercialization of new product reimbursement policy may adversely affect our ability to sell our product on profitable basis in many international market government control the price of prescription pharmaceutical including through the implementation of reference pricing price cut rebate revenue related tax tender and profit control and they expect price of prescription pharmaceutical to decline over the life of the product or volume increase for example we anticipate the government of japan will impose significant pricing discount for harvoni and sovaldi that will start taking effect in the first half of united state healthcare reformlegislative and regulatory change to government prescription drug procurement and reimbursement program occur relatively frequently in the united state and foreign jurisdiction in march healthcare reform legislation wa adopted in the united state requiring to further rebate or discount product reimbursed or paid for by various public payer including medicaid and other entity eligible to purchase discounted product through the drug pricing program under the public health service act such adaps in the united state we along with other pharmaceutical manufacturer of branded drug product are required to pay portion of an industry fee also known the branded prescription drug bpd fee calculated based on select government sale during the year percentage of total industry government sale the amount of the annual bpd fee to be billed to the pharmaceutical industry whole is billion in through which will increase to billion in increase to peak of billion in and then decrease to billion in and thereafter the bpd fee is not tax deductible in the internal revenue service irs issued final regulation which accelerated the expense recognition criterion for the fee obligation from the year in which the fee is paid to the year in which the market share used to allocate the fee is determined our bpd fee expense were million in million in and million in we expect our portion of the bpd fee to increase the total annual industry wide fee increase through and drug patent expire on major drug of other company in addition even though not addressed in the healthcare reform legislation discussion continue at the federal level on legislation that would either allow or require the federal government to directly negotiate price concession from pharmaceutical manufacturer or set minimum requirement for medicare part pricing further certain state have proposed legislation that seek to regulate pharmaceutical drug pricing if such proposed legislation is passed we may experience additional pricing pressure on our product in addition state medicaid program could request additional supplemental rebate on our product result of the increase in the federal base medicaid rebate private insurer could also use the enactment of these increased rebate to exert pricing pressure on our product and to the extent that private insurer or managed care program follow medicaid coverage and payment development the adverse effect may be magnified by private insurer adopting lower payment schedule health care fraud and abuse law and anti bribery law we are subject to various federal and state law pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including anti kickback law and false claim law anti kickback law make it illegal for prescription drug manufacturer to solicit offer receive or any remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of business including the purchase or prescription of particular drug due to the breadth of the statutory provision and the increasing attention being given to them by law enforcement authority it is possible that certain of our practice may be challenged under anti kickback or similar law false claim law generally prohibit anyone from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claim for payment by federal and certain state payer including medicare and medicaid or knowingly making using or causing to be made or used false record or statement material to false or fraudulent claim our sale marketing and medical activity may be subject to scrutiny under these law in addition the foreign corrupt practice act and similar worldwide anti bribery law generally prohibit company and their intermediary from making improper payment for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policy mandate compliance with these anti bribery law we operate in part of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree in certain circumstance strict compliance with anti bribery law may conflict with local custom and practice or may require to interact with doctor and hospital some of which may be state controlled in manner that is different than local custom despite our training and compliance program our internal control policy and procedure may not protect from reckless or criminal act committed by our employee or agent violation of fraud and abuse law or anti bribery law may be punishable by criminal and or civil sanction including fine and civil monetary penalty well the possibility of exclusion from federal health care program including medicare and medicaid violation can also lead to the imposition of corporate integrity agreement or similar government oversight program if the government were to allege against or convict of violating these law there could be disruption on our business and material adverse effect on our result of operation compulsory license in number of developing country government official and other interested group have suggested that pharmaceutical company should make drug for hcv or hiv infection available at low cost alternatively government in those developing country could require that we grant compulsory license to allow competitor to manufacture and sell their own version of our product thereby reducing our product sale for example there is growing attention on the availability of hcv therapy and some activist are advocating for the increased availability of hcv therapy through mean including compulsory license in the past certain office of the government of brazil have expressed concern over the affordability of our hiv product and declared that they were considering issuing compulsory license to permit the manufacture of otherwise patented product for hiv infection including viread in addition concern over the cost and availability of tamiflu related to potential avian flu pandemic and influenza generated international discussion over compulsory licensing of our tamiflu patent for example the canadian government considered allowing canadian manufacturer to manufacture and export the active ingredient in tamiflu to eligible developing and least developed country under canada access to medicine regime furthermore roche issued voluntary license to permit third party manufacturing of tamiflu for example roche granted sublicense to shanghai pharmaceutical group co ltd for china and sublicense to india hetero drug limited for india and certain developing country if compulsory license permit generic manufacturing to override our product patent for harvoni sovaldi our hiv product or tamiflu or if we are required to grant compulsory license for these product it could reduce our earnings and cash flow and harm our business in addition certain country do not permit enforcement of our patent and third party manufacturer are able to sell generic version of our product in those country for example in july the brazilian patent authority rejected our patent application for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate the active pharmaceutical ingredient in viread this wa the highest level of appeal available to within the brazilian patent authority because we do not currently have patent in brazil the brazilian government now purchase it supply of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate from generic manufacturer sale of generic version of our product could significantly reduce our sale and adversely affect our result of operation particularly if generic version of our product are imported into territory where we have existing commercial sale employeesas of january we had approximately employee we believe we have good relation with our employee environment health and safety we strive to incorporate sustainability in all phase of our drug development business from the ethical sourcing of natural renewable material to utilizing green chemistry practice we continue to look for way to minimize our impact on the environment some factor that contribute to our environmental impact include greenhouse gas emission produced by employee commute the energy and water consumed by our facility and the use of hazardous material such chemical virus and radioactive compound in our facility please refer to our sustainability report found on our website at www gilead com under responsibility for some of the measure we have taken to mitigate the environmental impact from our business are subject to number of law and regulation that require compliance with federal state and local regulation regarding workplace safety and protection of the environment we anticipate additional regulation in the near future law and regulation are implemented and under consideration to mitigate the effect of climate change mainly caused by greenhouse gas emission our business is not energy intensive therefore we do not anticipate being subject to cap and trade system or other mitigation measure that would materially impact our capital expenditure operation or competitive position based on current information and subject to the finalization of proposed regulation we believe that our primary risk related to climate change is increased energy cost other information we are subject to the information requirement of the exchange act therefore we file periodic report proxy statement and other information with the sec such report proxy statement and other information may be obtained by visiting the public reference room of the sec at street ne washington or by calling the sec at sec by sending an electronic message to the sec at publicinfo sec gov or by sending fax to the sec at in addition the sec maintains website www sec gov that contains report proxy and information statement and other information regarding issuer that file electronically the mailing address of our headquarters is lakeside drive foster city california and our telephone number at that location is our website is www gilead com through link on the investor section of our website under sec filing in the financial information section we make available the following filing soon reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the sec our annual report on form quarterly report on form current report on form and any amendment to those report filed or furnished pursuant to section or of the exchange act all such filing are available free of charge upon request transaction with iranwe did not have any transaction with iran during that would require disclosure in this annual report on form item risk factorsin evaluating our business you should carefully consider the following risk in addition to the other information in this annual report on form manifestation of any of the following risk could materially and adversely affect our business result of operation and financial condition we note these factor for investor permitted by the private security litigation reform act of it is not possible to predict or identify all such factor and therefore you should not consider the following risk to be complete statement of all the potential risk or uncertainty that we face substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sale of product to treat hcv and hiv if we are unable to maintain or continue increasing sale of these product our result of operation may be adversely affected during the year ended december sale of harvoni and sovaldi for the treatment of hcv accounted for approximately of our total product sale we can not be certain if prior year sale of our hcv product are indicative of future sale the number of warehoused hcv patient ha diminished since the first quarter of and we anticipate that the rate at which new patient started treatment during the second half of may be more indicative of the pace of new patient start in with the approval and entry of competitor hcv product in december and january we can not predict whether and to extent our hcv revenue may be adversely affected by competition from these product based on price and or market share result of the launch of competing regimen we have experienced and may continue to experience increased pricing pressure we have provided significant discount or rebate to public and private payer in order to obtain formulary status and to expand access for patient to our hcv product in addition future sale of harvoni and sovaldi are difficult to estimate because demand depends in part on the extent of reimbursement of our hcv product by private and government payer in light of continued fiscal and debt crisis experienced by several country in the european union eu and japan government have announced or implemented measure to manage healthcare expenditure we continue to experience global pricing pressure which often result in increase in the amount of discount required on our product or delayed reimbursement which could negatively impact our future product sale and result of operation also private and public payer can choose to exclude harvoni or sovaldi from their formulary coverage list or limit the type of patient for whom coverage will be provided which would negatively impact the demand for and revenue of harvoni and sovaldi any change in the formulary coverage reimbursement level or discount or rebate offered on our hcv product to payer may impact our anticipated revenue we expect pricing pressure in the hcv market to continue for example we anticipate the government of japan will impose significant pricing discount for harvoni and sovaldi that will start taking effect in the first half of if we are unable to maintain our forecast for hcv similar to prior year or obtain approval or reimbursement for additional hcv product candidate in the currently anticipated timeline our result of operation and stock price could be negatively affected we receive substantial portion of our revenue from sale of our product for the treatment of hiv infection particularly our single tablet regimen product stribild complera eviplera and atripla during the year ended december sale of our hiv product accounted for approximately of our total product sale most of our hiv product contain tenofovir alafenamide taf tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and or emtricitabine which belong to the nucleoside class of antiviral therapeutic if the treatment paradigm for hiv change causing nucleoside based therapeutic to fall out of favor or if we are unable to maintain or continue increasing our hiv product sale our result of operation would likely suffer and we would likely need to scale back our operation including our spending on research and development effort we may not be able to sustain or increase the growth rate of sale of our hcv or hiv product for any number of reason including but not limited to the following our hcv and hiv product are used over longer period of time in many patient and in combination with other product and additional study are conducted new issue with respect to safety resistance and interaction with other drug may arise which could cause to provide additional warning or contraindication on our label narrow our approved indication or halt sale of product each of which could reduce our revenue our product mature private insurer and government payer often reduce the amount they will reimburse patient for these product which increase pressure on to reduce price if physician do not see the benefit of our hcv or hiv product the sale of our hcv or hiv product will be limited new hcv or new or generic hiv product are introduced into major market our ability to maintain pricing and market share may be affected if we fail to commercialize new product or expand the indication for existing product our prospect for future revenue may be adversely affected if we do not introduce new product or increase sale of our existing product we will not be able to increase or maintain our total revenue continue to expand our effort drug development is inherently risky and many product candidate fail during the drug development process for example in january we announced that we terminated our phase study of simtuzumab for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis after data showed lack of treatment benefit in the second quarter of we filed our nda and maa for the approval of two dos of fixed dose combination of emtricitabine and taf for the treatment of hiv infection in adult and pediatric patient age year and older in combination with other hiv antiretroviral agent in the united state and european union in the third quarter of we filed our nda and maa for the approval of the single tablet regimen of rilpivirine emtricitabine and taf in the united state and european union in the fourth quarter of we filed our nda and maa for the approval of single tablet regimen of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir for the treatment of hcv in the united state and european union in the first quarter of we filed our nda and maa for the approval of taf for the treatment of chronic hepatitis virus hbv infection in the united state and european union these marketing application may not be approved by the regulatory authority on timely basis or at all even if marketing approval is granted for these product there may be significant limitation on their use further we may be unable to file our marketing application for new product our inability to accurately predict demand for our product the uptake of new product or the timing of fluctuation in the inventory maintained by customer make it difficult for to accurately forecast sale and may cause our revenue and earnings to fluctuate which could adversely affect our financial result and our stock price we may be unable to accurately predict demand for our product including the uptake of new product demand is dependent on number of factor for example our hcv product harvoni and sovaldi represent significant change in the treatment paradigm for hcv infected patient due to the shortened duration of treatment and the reduction or elimination of the need for pegylated interferon injection and ribavirin in certain patient population because these product represent cure and are in new therapeutic area for revenue from these product in and beyond are difficult for and investor to estimate demand for harvoni and sovaldi will depend on the availability of hcv patient and the extent of reimbursement of our hcv product by private and public payer in the united state and other country private and public payer can choose to exclude harvoni or sovaldi from their formulary coverage list or limit the type of patient for whom coverage will be provided which would negatively impact the demand for and revenue of harvoni and sovaldi also because our hcv product represent significant change in the treatment paradigm and in light of the launch of competitive product sale level or prescription growth rate may not be indicative of future sale we have experienced and may continue to experience increased pricing pressure in the united state european union and other country and in certain case have significant discount to private and public payer in order to obtain formulary status or to expand access for patient to our hcv product any change in the formulary coverage reimbursement level or discount or rebate offered on our hcv product to payer may negatively impact our anticipated revenue we expect pricing pressure to continue because hcv related revenue are difficult to predict investor may have widely varying expectation that may be materially higher or lower than our actual revenue to the extent our hcv product revenue exceed or fall short of these expectation our stock price may experience significant volatility in the year ended december approximately of our product sale in the united state were to three wholesaler amerisourcebergen corp mckesson corp and cardinal health inc the wholesaler with whom we have entered into inventory management agreement make estimate to determine end user demand and may not be completely effective in matching their inventory level to actual end user demand result change in inventory level held by those wholesaler can cause our operating result to fluctuate unexpectedly if our sale to these wholesaler do not match end user demand in addition inventory is held at retail pharmacy and other non wholesaler location with whom we have no inventory management agreement and no control over buying pattern adverse change in economic condition or other factor may cause retail pharmacy to reduce their inventory of our product which would reduce their order from wholesaler and consequently the wholesaler order from even if end user demand ha not changed for example during the second half of strong wholesaler and sub wholesaler purchase of our hiv product resulted in inventory draw down by wholesaler and sub wholesaler in the first quarter of inventory in the distribution channel fluctuates from quarter to quarter we may continue to see fluctuation in our earnings and mismatch between prescription demand for our product and our revenue in addition the non retail sector in the united state which includes government institution including state aid drug assistance program adaps veteran administration va correctional facility and large health maintenance organization tends to be even le consistent in term of buying pattern and often cause quarter over quarter fluctuation that do not necessarily mirror patient demand for our product federal and state budget pressure including sequestration well the annual grant cycle for federal and state fund may cause purchasing pattern to not reflect patient demand of our product for example in the first quarter of certain prior year we observed large non retail purchase of our hiv product by number of state adaps that exceeded patient demand we believe such purchase were driven by the grant cycle for federal adap fund additionally during the second half of we experienced fluctuation in va new patient start and purchasing pattern due to va funding we expect to continue to experience fluctuation in the purchasing pattern of our non retail customer which may result in fluctuation in our product sale revenue and earnings in the future in light of the global economic downturn and budget crisis faced by many european country we have observed variation in purchasing pattern induced by cost containment measure in europe we believe these measure have caused some government agency and other purchaser to reduce inventory of our product in the distribution channel which ha decreased our revenue and caused fluctuation in our product sale and earnings we may continue to see this trend in the future our result of operation may be adversely affected by current and potential future healthcare reform legislative and regulatory change to government prescription drug procurement and reimbursement program occur relatively frequently in the united state and foreign jurisdiction in the united state we along with other pharmaceutical manufacturer of branded drug product are required to pay portion of an industry fee also known the branded prescription drug bpd fee calculated

significant portion of our sale of the majority of our product are subject to significant discount from list price and rebate obligation see also our risk factor substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sale of product to treat hcv and hiv if we are unable to maintain or continue increasing sale of these product our result of operation may be adversely affected in the united state state aid drug assistance program adaps which purchase significant portion of our hiv product rely on federal supplemental federal and state funding to help fund purchase of our product if federal and state fund are not available in amount sufficient to support the number of patient that rely on adaps sale of our hiv product could be negatively impacted which would reduce our revenue in prior quarter because of the insufficiency of federal and state fund and many state reduced eligibility criterion we saw an increase in the number of patient on state adap waitlists and we may see similar increase in future period result of any reduction in federal and state adap support until these patient are enrolled in an adap they generally receive free product from industry supported patient assistance program or are unable to access treatment the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the united state and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement control in the european union will put additional pressure on product pricing reimbursement and usage which may adversely affect our product sale and profitability these pressure can arise from rule and practice of managed care group judicial decision and governmental law and regulation related to medicare medicaid and healthcare reform pharmaceutical reimbursement policy and pricing in general we continue to experience global pricing pressure on our hcv product which often result in increase in the amount of discount required on our product or delayed reimbursement which could negatively impact our future product sale and result of operation also private and public payer can choose to exclude harvoni or sovaldi from their formulary coverage or limit the type of patient for whom coverage will be provided which could negatively impact the demand for and revenue of harvoni and sovaldi any change in the formulary coverage reimbursement level or discount or rebate offered on our hcv product to payer may impact our anticipated revenue we expect pricing pressure in the hcv market to continue see also our risk factor substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sale of product to treat hcv and hiv if we are unable to maintain or continue increasing sale of these product our result of operation may be adversely affected in july we received letter from the senate committee on finance senate committee requesting information and supporting documentation from related to sovaldi and the pricing of sovaldi in the united state the letter raised concern about our approach to pricing sovaldi it affordability and it impact on federal government spending and public health in december the senate committee released the result of the investigation which alleged that we engaged in revenue driven pricing strategy in setting sovaldi price gilead disagrees with many of the conclusion in the report in january we received letter from the massachusetts attorney general that their office is considering whether our pricing of sovaldi and harvoni may constitute an unfair trade practice in violation of massachusetts law in february the massachusetts attorney general office served with civil investigative demand requesting that we produce document related to our hcv product it is possible that the result of the senate committee investigation and any action taken by the massachusetts attorney general or other state government could result in negative publicity or other negative action that could harm our reputation reduce demand for harvoni sovaldi or other sofosbuvir containing product and or reduce coverage of harvoni sovaldi or other sofosbuvir containing product including by federal health care program such medicare and medicaid and state health care program if any or all of these event occur our business and stock price could be materially and adversely affected in country outside the united state the success of our commercialized product and any other product candidate we may develop will depend largely on obtaining and maintaining government reimbursement because in many country patient are unlikely to use prescription drug that are not reimbursed by their government recently many country in the european union have increased the level of discounting required on our product and these effort could continue country attempt to manage healthcare expenditure especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crisis experienced by many country in the european union cost containment pressure in the european union especially in southern europe could lead to delay in the treatment of patient and also delay pricing approval by month or more which could negatively impact the commercialization of new product reimbursement policy may adversely affect our ability to sell our product on profitable basis in many international market government control the price of prescription pharmaceutical including the implementation of reference pricing price cut rebate revenue related tax tender and profit control and they expect price of prescription pharmaceutical to decline over the life of the product or volume increase for example we anticipate the government of japan will impose significant pricing discount for harvoni and sovaldi that will start taking effect in the first half of approximately of our product sale occur outside the united state and currency fluctuation and hedging expense may cause our earnings to fluctuate which could adversely affect our stock price because significant percentage of our product sale are denominated in foreign currency primarily the euro and yen we face exposure to adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rate when the dollar strengthens against these foreign currency the relative value of sale made in the respective foreign currency decrease conversely when the dollar weakens against these currency the relative value of such sale increase overall we are net receiver of foreign currency and therefore benefit from weaker dollar and are adversely affected by stronger dollar we use foreign currency exchange forward and option contract to hedge percentage of our forecasted international sale primarily those denominated in the euro and yen we also hedge certain monetary asset and liability denominated in foreign currency which reduces but doe not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuation between the date transaction is recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid foreign currency exchange net of hedge had an unfavorable impact of million on our revenue compared to and favorable impact of million on our revenue compared to we can not predict future fluctuation in the foreign currency exchange rate of the dollar if the dollar appreciates significantly against certain currency and our hedging program doe not sufficiently offset the effect of such appreciation our result of operation will be adversely affected and our stock price may decline additionally the expense that we recognize in relation to our hedging activity can also cause our earnings to fluctuate the level of hedging expense that we recognize in particular period is impacted by the change in interest rate spread between the foreign currency that we hedge and the dollar we face significant competition we face significant competition from large global pharmaceutical and biotechnology company specialized pharmaceutical firm and generic drug manufacturer our hcv product harvoni and sovaldi compete with viekira pak ombitasvir paritaprevir and ritonavir tablet co packaged with dasabuvir tablet marketed by abbvie inc abbvie zepatier elbasvir and grazoprevir marketed by merck co inc merck daklinza daclastavir marketed by bristol myers squibb company bm and olysio simeprevir marketed by janssen therapeutic our hiv product compete primarily with product from viiv healthcare viiv which market fixed dose combination product that compete with genvoya stribild complera eviplera atripla and truvada for example two product marketed by viiv tivicay dolutegravir an integrase inhibitor and triumeq single tablet triple combination antiretroviral regimen could adversely impact sale of our hiv product in addition lamivudine marketed by this joint venture competes with emtricitabine the active pharmaceutical ingredient of emtriva and component of genvoya stribild complera eviplera atripla and truvada for tybost we compete with ritonavir marketed by abbvie we also face competition from generic hiv product generic version of lamivudine and combivir lamivudine and zidovudine are available in the united state and certain other country generic version of sustiva efavirenz component of our atripla are now available in canada and europe and we anticipate competition from generic efavirenz in the united state in december we have observed some pricing pressure related to the sustiva component of our atripla sale our hbv product viread and hepsera face competition from baraclude entecavir marketed by bm well generic entecavir our hbv product also compete with tyzeka sebivo telbivudine marketed by novartis pharmaceutical corporation novartis zydelig competes with imbruvica ibrutinib marketed by pharmacyclics inc gazyva obinutuzumab marketed by genentech member of the roche group and treanda bendamustine hydrochloride marketed by cephalon inc letairis competes with tracleer bosentan and opsumit macitentan marketed by actelion pharmaceutical inc and also with adcirca tadalafil marketed by united therapeutic corporation and pfizer inc pfizer competes predominantly with generic compound from three distinct class of drug for the treatment of chronic angina in the united state including generic and or branded beta blocker calcium channel blocker and long acting nitrate cayston competes with tobi tobramycin inhalation solution marketed by novartis tamiflu competes with relenza zanamivir marketed by glaxosmithkline and product sold by generic competitor ambisome competes with vfend voriconazole marketed by pfizer and caspofungin product developed by merck that is marketed cancidas in the united state and caspofungin elsewhere in addition we are aware of at least three lipid formulation that claim similarity to ambisome becoming available outside of the united state these formulation may reduce market demand for ambisome furthermore the manufacture of lipid formulation of amphotericin is very complex and if any of these formulation are found to be unsafe sale of ambisome may be negatively impacted by association in addition number of company are pursuing the development of technology which are competitive with our existing product or research program these competing company include specialized pharmaceutical firm and large pharmaceutical company acting either independently or together with other pharmaceutical company furthermore academic institution government agency and other public and private organization conducting research may seek patent protection and may establish collaborative arrangement for competitive product or program if any of these competitor gain market share on our product it could adversely affect our result of operation and stock price if significant safety issue arise for our marketed product or our product candidate our future sale may be reduced which would adversely affect our result of operation the data supporting the marketing approval for our product and forming the basis for the safety warning in our product label were obtained in controlled clinical trial of limited duration and in some case from post approval use our product are used over longer period of time by many patient with underlying health problem taking numerous other medicine we expect to continue to find new issue such safety resistance or drug interaction issue which may require to provide additional warning or contraindication on our label or narrow our approved indication each of which could reduce the market acceptance of these product regulatory authority have been moving towards more active and transparent pharmacovigilance and are making greater amount of stand alone safety information and clinical trial data directly available to the public through website and other mean periodic safety update report summary risk management plan summary and various adverse event data safety information without the appropriate context and expertise may be misinterpreted and lead to misperception or legal action which may potentially cause our product sale or stock price to decline further if serious safety resistance or drug interaction issue arise with our marketed product sale of these product could be limited or halted by or by regulatory authority and our result of operation would be adversely affected our operation depend on compliance with complex fda and comparable international regulation failure to obtain broad approval on timely basis or to maintain compliance could delay or halt commercialization of our product the product we develop must be approved for marketing and sale by regulatory authority and once approved are subject to extensive regulation by the food and drug administration fda the european medicine agency ema and comparable regulatory agency in other country we are continuing clinical trial for harvoni sovaldi truvada atripla stribild complera eviplera viread genvoya emtriva tybost vitekta letairis ranexa cayston zydelig and hepsera for currently approved and additional us we anticipate that we will file for marketing approval in additional country and for additional indication and product over the next several year these product may fail to receive such marketing approval on timely basis or at all further how we manufacture and sell our product is subject to extensive regulation and review discovery of previously unknown problem with our marketed product or problem with our manufacturing safety reporting or promotional activity may result in restriction on our product including withdrawal of the product from the market if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirement including those related to promotion and manufacturing we could be subject to penalty including fine suspension of regulatory approval product recall seizure of product and criminal prosecution for example under fda rule we are often required to conduct post approval clinical study to ass known serious risk signal of serious risk or to identify an unexpected serious risk and implement risk evaluation and mitigation strategy for our product which could include medication guide patient package insert communication plan to healthcare provider or other element fda deems are necessary to assure safe use of the drug which could include imposing certain on the distribution or use of product failure to comply with these or other requirement if imposed on sponsor by fda could result in significant civil monetary penalty and our operating result may be adversely affected the result and anticipated timeline of our clinical trial are uncertain and may not support continued development of product candidate which would adversely affect our prospect for future revenue growth we are required to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of product that we develop for each intended use through extensive preclinical study and clinical trial the result from preclinical and early clinical study do not always accurately predict result in later large scale clinical trial even successfully completed large scale clinical trial may not result in marketable product for example in january we announced that we terminated our phase trial of simtuzumab for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis after result showed lack of treatment benefit if any of our product candidate fails to achieve it primary endpoint in clinical trial if safety issue arise or if the result from our clinical trial are otherwise inadequate to support regulatory approval of our product candidate commercialization of that product candidate could be delayed or halted in addition we may also face challenge in clinical trial protocol design if the clinical trial for any of the product candidate in our pipeline are delayed or terminated our prospect for future revenue growth would be adversely impacted for example we face numerous risk and uncertainty with our product candidate including the single tablet regimen of emtricitabine and taf for the treatment of hiv the single tablet regimen of sof velpatasvir and for the treatment of chronic hcv idelalisib for the treatment of relapsed refractory indolent non hodgkin lymphoma and frontline and relapsed refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia momelotinib for the treatment of myelofibrosis and pancreatic cancer eleclazine formerly for the treatment of long qt syndrome and for the treatment of ulcerative colitis each currently in phase clinical trial that could prevent completion of development of these product candidate these risk include our ability to enroll patient in clinical trial the possibility of unfavorable result of our clinical trial the need to modify or delay our clinical trial or to perform additional trial and the risk of failing to obtain fda and other regulatory body approval result our product candidate may never be successfully commercialized further we may make strategic decision to discontinue development of our product candidate if for example we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunity in our pipeline if these program and others in our pipeline can not be completed on timely basis or at all then our prospect for future revenue growth may be adversely impacted in addition clinical trial involving our commercial product could raise new safety issue for our existing product which could in turn decrease our revenue and harm our business due to our reliance on third party contract research organization to conduct our clinical trial we are unable to directly control the timing conduct expense and quality of our clinical trial we extensively outsource our clinical trial activity and usually perform only small portion of the start up activity in house we rely on independent third party contract research organization cro to perform most of our clinical study including document preparation site identification screening and preparation pre study visit training program management and bioanalytical analysis many important aspect of the service performed for by the cro are out of our direct control if there is any dispute or disruption in our relationship with our cro our clinical trial may be delayed moreover in our regulatory submission we rely on the quality and validity of the clinical work performed by third party cro if any of our cro process methodology or result were determined to be invalid or inadequate our own clinical data and result and related regulatory approval could be adversely affected we depend on relationship with other company for sale and marketing performance development and commercialization of product candidate and revenue failure to maintain these relationship poor performance by these company or dispute with these company could negatively impact our business we rely on number of significant collaborative relationship with major pharmaceutical company for our sale and marketing performance in certain territory these include collaboration with janssen for complera eviplera bm for atripla in the united state europe and canada hoffmann la roche ltd together with hoffmann la roche inc roche for tamiflu worldwide and gsk for ambrisentan in territory outside of the united state in some country we rely on international distributor for sale of truvada viread hepsera emtriva and ambisome some of these relationship also involve the clinical development of these product by our partner reliance on collaborative relationship pose number of risk including the risk that we are unable to control the resource our corporate partner devote to our program or product dispute may arise with respect to the ownership of right to technology developed with our corporate partner disagreement with our corporate partner could cause delay in or termination of the research development or commercialization of product candidate or result in litigation or arbitration contract with our corporate partner may fail to provide significant protection or may fail to be effectively enforced if one of these partner fails to perform our corporate partner have considerable discretion in electing whether to pursue the development of any additional product and may pursue alternative technology or product either on their own or in collaboration with our competitor our corporate partner with marketing right may choose to pursue competing technology or to devote fewer resource to the marketing of our product than they do to product of their own development and our distributor and our corporate partner may be unable to pay particularly in light of current economic condition given these risk there is great deal of uncertainty regarding the success of our current and future collaborative effort if these effort fail our product development or commercialization of new product could be delayed or revenue from product could decline in addition letairis and cayston are distributed through third party specialty pharmacy which are pharmacy specializing in the dispensing of medication for complex or chronic condition that may require high level of patient education and ongoing counseling the use of specialty pharmacy requires significant coordination with our sale and marketing medical affair regulatory affair legal and finance organization and involves risk including but not limited to risk that these specialty pharmacy will not provide with accurate or timely information regarding their inventory patient data or safety complaint not effectively sell or support letairis or cayston not devote the resource necessary to sell letairis or cayston in the volume and within the time frame that we expect not be able to satisfy their financial obligation to or others or cease operation we also rely on third party to administer our letairis education and access program leap the restricted distribution program designed to support letairis this third party provides information and education to prescribers and patient on the risk of letairis confirms insurance coverage and investigates alternative source of reimbursement or assistance ensures fulfillment of the risk management requirement mandated for letairis by fda and coordinate and control dispensing to patient through the third party specialty pharmacy failure of this third party or the specialty pharmacy that distribute letairis to perform expected may result in regulatory action from fda or decreased letairis sale either of which would harm our business further cayston may only be taken by patient using specific inhalation device that delivers the drug to the lung of patient our ongoing distribution of cayston is entirely reliant upon the manufacturer of that device this manufacturer could encounter other issue with regulatory agency related to the device or be unable to supply sufficient quantity of this device in addition the manufacturer may not be able to provide adequate warranty support for the device after it ha been distributed to patient with respect to distribution of the drug and device to patient we are reliant on the capability of specialty pharmacy for example the distribution channel for drug and device is complicated and requires coordination the reimbursement approval process associated with both drug and device are similarly complex if the device manufacturer is unable to obtain reimbursement approval or receives approval at lower than expected price sale of cayston may be adversely affected any of the previously described issue may limit the sale of cayston which would adversely affect our financial result our success will depend to significant degree on our ability to defend our patent and other intellectual property right both domestically and internationally we may not be able to obtain effective patent to protect our technology from use by competitor and patent of other company could require to stop using or pay for the use of required technology patent and other proprietary right are very important to our business our success will depend to significant degree on our ability to obtain patent and license to patent right preserve trade secret defend against infringement and effort to invalidate our patent and operate without infringing on the intellectual property of others we have properly drafted and enforceable patent it can be more difficult for our competitor to use our technology to create competitive product and more difficult for our competitor to obtain patent that prevents from using technology we create part of our business strategy we actively seek patent protection both in the united state and internationally and file additional patent application when appropriate to cover improvement in our compound product and technology we have number of and foreign patent patent application and right to patent related to our compound product and technology but we can not be certain that issued patent will be enforceable or provide adequate protection or that pending patent application will result in issued patent patent application are confidential for period of time before patent is issued result we may not know if our competitor filed patent application for technology covered by our pending application or if we were the first to invent or first to file an application directed toward the technology that is the subject of our patent application competitor may have filed patent application or received patent and may obtain additional patent and proprietary right that block or compete with our product in addition if competitor file patent application covering our technology we may have to participate in litigation interference or other proceeding to determine the right to patent litigation interference or other proceeding are unpredictable and expensive such that even if we are ultimately successful our result of operation may be adversely affected by such event patent do not cover the ranolazine compound the active ingredient of ranexa instead when it wa discovered that only sustained release formulation of ranolazine would achieve therapeutic plasma level patent were obtained on those formulation and the characteristic plasma level they achieve patent do not cover the active ingredient in ambisome we may obtain patent for certain product many year before marketing approval is obtained for those product because patent have limited life which may begin to run prior to the commercial sale of the related product the commercial value of the patent may be limited however we may be able to apply for patent term extension or supplementary protection certificate in some country generic manufacturer have sought and may continue to seek fda approval to market generic version of our product through an abbreviated new drug application anda the application form typically used by manufacturer seeking approval of generic drug see description of our anda litigation in note commitment and contingency legal proceeding of the note to consolidated financial statement included in item of this annual report on form and risk factor entitled litigation with generic manufacturer ha increased our expense which may continue to reduce our earnings if we are unsuccessful in all or some of these lawsuit some or all of our claim in the patent may be narrowed or invalidated and generic version of our product could be launched prior to our patent expiry beginning on page our success depends in large part on our ability to operate without infringing upon the patent or other proprietary right of third party if we infringe the valid patent of third party we may be prevented from commercializing product or may be required to obtain license from these third party we may not be able to obtain alternative technology or any required license on reasonable term or at all if we fail to obtain these license or alternative technology we may be unable to develop or commercialize some or all of our product for example we are aware of patent that may relate to our operation of leap our restricted distribution program designed to support letairis and we are aware of patent and patent application owned by other party that may claim to cover the use of sofosbuvir see description of our litigation regarding sofosbuvir in note commitment and contingency legal proceeding of the note to consolidated financial statement included in item of this annual report on form and the risk factor entitled if any party is successful in establishing exclusive right to harvoni and or sovaldi our expected revenue and earnings from the sale of harvoni and or sovaldi could be adversely affected beginning on page furthermore we also rely on unpatented trade secret and improvement unpatented internal know how and technological innovation we protect these right mainly through confidentiality agreement with our corporate partner employee consultant and vendor these agreement provide that all confidential information developed or made known to an individual during the course of their relationship with will be kept confidential and will not be used or disclosed to third party except in specified circumstance in the case of employee the agreement provide that all invention made by an individual while employed by will be our exclusive property we can not be certain that these party will comply with these confidentiality agreement that we have adequate remedy for any breach or that our trade secret will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitor under some of our agreement invention become jointly owned by and our corporate partner and in other case become the exclusive property of one party in certain circumstance it can be difficult to determine who owns particular invention and dispute could arise regarding those invention if our trade secret or confidential information become known or independently discovered by competitor or if we enter into dispute over ownership of invention our business and result of operation could be adversely affected any party is successful in establishing exclusive right to harvoni and or sovaldi our expected revenue and earnings from the sale of harvoni and or sovaldi could be adversely affected we own patent and patent application that claim sofosbuvir sovaldi chemical entity and it metabolite and the fixed dose combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir harvoni third party may have or may obtain right to patent that allegedly could be used to prevent or attempt to prevent from commercializing harvoni or sovaldi for example we are aware of patent and patent application owned by other party that may be alleged by such party to cover the use of harvoni and sovaldi we can not predict the ultimate outcome of intellectual property claim related to harvoni or sovaldi and we have spent and will continue to spend significant resource defending against these claim if these party successfully obtain valid and enforceable patent and successfully prove infringement of those patent by harvoni and or sovaldi we could be prevented from selling sofosbuvir unless we were able to obtain license under such patent such license may not be available on commercially reasonable term or at all interference proceeding and litigation with idenix pharmaceutical inc idenix in february we received notice that the patent and trademark office uspto had declared interference no first idenix interference between our patent no the patent and idenix pending patent application no an interference is proceeding before the uspto designed to determine who wa the first to invent the subject matter claimed by both party in january the uspto patent trial and appeal board ptab determined that pharmasset and not idenix wa the first to invent the compound in dispute and accordingly gilead prevailed in the first idenix interference idenix ha appealed the ptab decision to the district court for the district of delaware in december after receiving our request to do so the uspto declared interference no second idenix interference between our pending patent application no and idenix patent no the patent the patent is related to the idenix patent application at issue in the first idenix interference and includes claim directed to method of treating hcv with nucleoside compound the purpose of the second idenix interference wa to determine who wa first to invent the claimed method of treating hcv with compound similar to those which were involved in the first idenix interference in march the ptab determined that pharmasset and not idenix wa the first to invent the claimed method of treating hcv idenix appealed this decision in both the district court for the district of delaware and the court of appeal for the federal circuit cafc we have filed motion to dismiss the appeal in delaware and will respond to the appeal filed in the cafc we believe that the idenix claim involved in the first and second idenix interference and similar and foreign patent claiming the same compound metabolite and us thereof are invalid result we filed an impeachment action in the federal court of canada to invalidate idenix canadian patent no the patent which is the canadian patent that corresponds to the patent idenix asserted that the commercialization of sovaldi in canada will infringe it patent and that our canadian patent no corresponding to the patent involved in the first idenix interference is invalid trial on these issue wa held in january and february and in november the federal court of canada rendered it public decision holding that idenix patent is invalid and that gilead patent is valid in the same month idenix appealed the court decision we filed similar legal action in norway in the oslo district court seeking to invalidate idenix norwegian patent corresponding to the patent in september idenix filed an invalidation action in the norwegian proceeding against our norwegian patent no patent which corresponds to gilead patent in march the norwegian court found all claim in the idenix norwegian patent to be invalid and upheld the validity of all claim in the challenged gilead patent in april idenix appealed the march decision to the norwegian court of appeal the appeal hearing from the march decision took place in february in january we filed legal action in the federal court of australia seeking to invalidate idenix australian patent corresponding to the patent in april idenix asserted that the commercialization of sovaldi in australia will infringe it australian patent corresponding to the patent month long trial wa completed in october in sydney decision is pending in march the european patent office epo granted idenix european patent no the patent which corresponds to the patent the same day that the patent wa granted we filed an opposition with the epo seeking to revoke the patent an opposition hearing wa held in february and the epo ruled in our favor and revoked the patent in march idenix also initiated infringement proceeding against in the united kingdom uk germany and france alleging that the commercialization of sovaldi would infringe the uk german and french counterpart of the patent trial wa held in the uk in october to determine the issue of infringement and validity of the idenix uk patent in december the high court of justice of england and wale uk court invalidated challenged claim of the patent on multiple ground the uk court ha granted idenix permission to appeal the december judgment the appeal of the uk court decision is scheduled for july in march the german court in düsseldorf determined that the idenix patent wa highly likely to be invalid and stayed the infringement proceeding pending the outcome of the opposition hearing held by the epo in february idenix ha not appealed this decision of the german court staying the proceeding upon idenix request the french proceeding have been stayed idenix ha not been awarded patent corresponding to the patent in japan or china in the event such patent are issued we expect to challenge them in proceeding similar to those we invoked in other country in december idenix universita degli studi di cagliari udsg centre national de la recherche scientifique and université montpellier ii sued in district court for the district of delaware alleging that the commercialization of sofosbuvir will infringe the patent and that an interference exists between the patent and our patent no also in december idenix and udsg sued in the district court for the district of massachusetts alleging that the commercialization of sofosbuvir will infringe patent no and in june the court transferred the massachusetts litigation to the district court for the district of delaware the district court ha set trial date in october and december for resolution of these issue decision by the district court may be appealed by either party to the cafc idenix wa acquired by merck in august while the acquisition doe not change our view of the lack of merit in the claim made by idenix merck ha greater resource than idenix and may therefore choose to fund the litigation at higher level than idenix litigation with merck in august merck contacted requesting that we pay royalty on the sale of sofosbuvir and obtain license to patent no and which it co owns with isi pharmaceutical inc in august we filed lawsuit in the district court for the northern district of california seeking declaratory judgment that the merck patent are invalid and not infringed merck patent no and cover compound which do not include but may relate to sofosbuvir during patent prosecution merck amended it patent application in an attempt to cover compound related to sofosbuvir if the court determines that merck patent are valid and that we have infringed those claim we may be required to obtain license from and pay royalty to merck to commercialize sofosbuvir the court ha set trial date of march for this lawsuit either party may appeal decision by the district court to the cafc litigation with abbvieabbvie ha obtained patent no and abbvie patent which purport to cover the use of combination of ldv sof or harvoni for the treatment of hcv gilead is aware that abbvie ha pending patent application in the united state and granted and pending application in other country we own published and pending patent application directed to the use of combination for the treatment of hcv and specifically to the combination of ldv sof certain of our application were filed before the abbvie patent for this reason and others we believe the abbvie patent are invalid accordingly in december we filed lawsuit in the district court for the district of delaware seeking declaratory judgment that the abbvie patent are invalid and unenforceable well other relief we believe that abbott laboratory inc and abbvie conspired to eliminate competition in the hcv market by falsely representing to the uspto that they and not gilead invented method of treating hcv using combination of ldv sof in february and march abbvie responded to our lawsuit by also filing two lawsuit in the district court for the district of delaware alleging that our fixed dose combination of ldv sof will infringe it patent all of those lawsuit have been consolidated into single action in the united state either party may appeal decision by the district court to the cafc the abbvie patent have not blocked or delayed the commercialization of our combination product in the united state canada or europe we do not expect any other foreign patent to block or delay the commercialization around the world the court ha set trial date of september for this lawsuit additionally abbvie ha obtained patent no which purport to cover solid oral dosage form containing ledipasvir accordingly in may we filed lawsuit in the district court for the district of delaware seeking declaratory judgment that abbvie patent is invalid well other relief we do not expect abbvie patent to block the commercialization of our combination product the court ha set trial date of july in august we brought an impeachment action seeking declaration that abbvie canadian patent no patent which purport to cover the use of combination of ldv sof for the treatment of hcv is invalid on the same day abbvie brought an infringement action which asserts that commercialization of harvoni in canada will infringe it the impeachment action ha been stayed and we have counterclaimed for invalidity in the infringement proceeding trial date ha not been set in november abbvie filed lawsuit against in the regional court düsseldorf for infringement of two quasi patent known utility model utility model are unexamined ip right and are not the same standard patent one utility model de purport to cover the use of combination of direct acting antiviral which includes at least an hcv polymerase inhibitor and an hcv inhibitor in the treatment of hcv the other utility model de purport to cover solid dispersion that includes ledipasvir trial date ha not been set if court determines that the abbvie patent are valid and that we have infringed those claim we may be required to obtain license from and pay royalty to abbvie to commercialize sofosbuvir combination product european patent claimsin february several party filed opposition in the european patent office requesting revocation of our granted european patent covering sofosbuvir that expires in while we are confident in the strength of our sofosbuvir patent we can not predict the ultimate outcome of these action if we are unsuccessful in defending these opposition some or all of our patent claim may be narrowed or revoked and the patent protection for sofosbuvir in europe could be substantially shortened or eliminated entirely if the sofosbuvir patent is revoked and no other european patent are granted covering sofosbuvir our exclusivity will be based entirely on regulatory exclusivity granted by the ema sovaldi ha been granted regulatory exclusivity that will prevent generic sofosbuvir from entering the eu for year following approval of sovaldi or january if we lose exclusivity for sovaldi prior to our expected revenue and result of operation could be negatively impacted for the year including and succeeding the year in which such exclusivity is lost which may cause our stock price to decline manufacturing problem including at our third party manufacturer and corporate partner could cause inventory shortage and delay product shipment and regulatory approval which may adversely affect our result of operation in order to generate revenue from our product we must be able to produce sufficient quantity of our product to satisfy demand many of our product are the result of complex manufacturing process the manufacturing process for pharmaceutical product is also highly regulated and regulator may shut down manufacturing facility that they believe do not comply with regulation our product are either manufactured at our own facility or by third party manufacturer or corporate partner we depend on third party to perform manufacturing activity effectively and on timely basis for the majority of our solid dose product in addition roche either by itself or through third party is responsible for manufacturing tamiflu we our third party manufacturer and our corporate partner are subject to good manufacturing practice gmp which are extensive regulation governing manufacturing process stability testing record keeping and quality standard defined by fda and the ema similar regulation are in effect in other country our third party manufacturer and corporate partner are independent entity who are subject to their own unique operational and financial risk which are out of our control if we or any of these third party manufacturer or corporate partner fail to perform required this could impair our ability to deliver our product on timely basis or receive royalty or cause delay in our clinical trial and application for regulatory approval further we may have to write off the cost of manufacturing any batch that fails to pas quality inspection or meet regulatory approval in addition we our third party manufacturer and our corporate partner may only be able to produce some of our product at one or limited number of facility and therefore have limited manufacturing capacity for certain product to the extent these risk materialize and affect their performance obligation to our financial result may be adversely affected our manufacturing operation are subject to routine inspection by regulatory agency for example in we received letter from fda related to the extent of method revalidations being conducted stability program oversight audit trail review data management and quality management system gap we completed and filed our response to these observation with fda if we are unable to remedy the deficiency cited by fda or to the extent there are additional deficiency cited by fda in future inspection our currently marketed product and the timing of regulatory approval of product in development could be adversely affected further there is risk that regulatory agency in other country where marketing application are pending will undertake similar additional review or apply heightened standard of review which could delay the regulatory approval for product in those country if approval of any of our product candidate were delayed or if production of our marketed product wa interrupted our anticipated revenue and our stock price would be adversely affected may not be able to obtain material or supply necessary to conduct clinical trial or to manufacture and sell our product which would limit our ability to generate revenue we need access to certain supply and product to conduct our clinical trial and to manufacture our product if we are unable to purchase sufficient quantity of these material or find suitable alternate material in timely manner our development effort for our product candidate may be delayed or our ability to manufacture our product would be limited which would limit our ability to generate revenue supplier of key component and material must be named in the nda or maa filed with fda ema or other regulatory authority for any product candidate for which we are seeking marketing approval and significant delay can occur if the qualification of new supplier is required even after manufacturer is qualified by the regulatory authority the manufacturer must continue to expend time money and effort in the area of production and quality control to ensure full compliance with gmp manufacturer are subject to regular periodic inspection by the regulatory authority following initial approval if result of these inspection regulatory authority determines that the equipment facility laboratory or process do not comply with applicable regulation and condition of product approval the regulatory authority may suspend the manufacturing operation if the manufacturing operation of any of the single supplier for our product are suspended we may be unable to generate sufficient quantity of commercial or clinical supply of product to meet market demand which would in turn decrease our revenue and harm our business in addition if delivery of material from our supplier were interrupted for any reason we may be unable to ship certain of our product for commercial supply or to supply our product in development for clinical trial in addition some of our product and the material that we utilize in our operation are made at only one facility for example we manufacture certain drug product intermediate utilized in ambisome exclusively at our facility in san dimas california in the event of disaster including an earthquake equipment failure or other difficulty we may be unable to replace this manufacturing capacity in timely manner and may be unable to manufacture ambisome to meet market need in addition we depend on single supplier for amphotericin the active pharmaceutical ingredient of ambisome and high quality cholesterol in the manufacture of ambisome we also rely on single source for the active pharmaceutical ingredient found in letairis and cayston astellas llc which market lexiscan in the united state is responsible for the commercial manufacture and supply of product in the united state and is dependent on single supplier for the active pharmaceutical ingredient of lexiscan problem with any of the single supplier we depend on may negatively impact our development and commercialization effort significant portion of the raw material and intermediate used to manufacture our antiviral product including harvoni sovaldi truvada atripla stribild complera eviplera viread genvoya and emtriva are supplied by china based company result an international trade dispute between china and the united state or any other action by the chinese government that would limit or prevent chinese company from supplying these material would adversely affect our ability to manufacture and supply our antiviral product to meet market need and have material and adverse effect on our operating result litigation with generic manufacturer ha increased our expense which may continue to reduce our earnings if we are unsuccessful in all or some of these lawsuit some or all of our claim in the patent may be narrowed or invalidated and generic version of our product could be launched prior to our patent expiry part of the approval process for some of our product fda granted new chemical entity nce exclusivity period during which other manufacturer application for approval of generic version of our product will not be approved generic manufacturer may challenge the patent protecting product that have been granted nce exclusivity one year prior to the end of the nce exclusivity period generic manufacturer have sought and may continue to seek fda approval for similar or identical drug through an anda the application form typically used by manufacturer seeking approval of generic drug current legal proceeding of significance with some of our generic manufacturer include april and july we received notice that mylan inc mylan submitted an anda to fda requesting permission to manufacture and market generic version of truvada and complera in the notice mylan alleges that the patent associated with truvada and complera are invalid unenforceable and or will not be infringed by mylan manufacture use or sale of generic version of these product we filed lawsuit against mylan in district court for the northern district of west virginia for infringement of our patent in june we received notice that mylan submitted petition for inter partes review ipr to the ptab alleging that four patent associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate are invalid we opposed mylan petition in december the ptab issued decision denying each of mylan petition for ipr in january mylan requested rehearing on the basis that it belief the ptab decision is wrong in august and november the ptab denied mylan request for rehearing in october we reached an agreement with mylan to settle the proceeding the term of the settlement agreement are confidential apotexin june we received notice that apotex inc apotex submitted an abbreviated new drug submission ands to health canada requesting permission to manufacture and market generic version of truvada and separate ands requesting permission to manufacture and market generic version of viread in the notice apotex alleges that three of the patent associated with truvada and two of the patent associated with viread are invalid unenforceable and or will not be infringed by apotex manufacture use or sale of generic version of truvada or viread in august we filed lawsuit against apotex in the federal court of canada seeking an order of prohibition against approval of this ands hearing in that case is scheduled for april tevain november december and august we received notice that teva pharmaceutical teva submitted an abbreviated new drug submission ands to the canadian minister of health requesting permission to manufacture and market generic version of truvada atripla and viread in the notice teva alleges that the patent associated with truvada atripla and viread are invalid unenforceable and or will not be infringed by teva manufacture use or sale of generic version of those product we filed lawsuit against teva in the federal court of canada seeking an order of prohibition against approval of these application in december the court issued an order prohibiting the canadian minister of health from approving teva generic version of our viread truvada and atripla product until expiry of our patent in july teva ha appealed that decision that decision did not rule on the validity of the patent and accordingly the only issue on appeal is whether the minister of health should be prohibited from approving teva product the appeal will be heard by the canadian federal court of appeal after the trial in the impeachment action the court will determine the validity of the patent in the pending impeachment action trial in the impeachment action is scheduled for november if teva is successful in invalidating our patent teva may be able to launch generic version of our viread

associated with ambrisentan tablet is invalid unenforceable and or will not be infringed by sigmapharm manufacture use or sale of generic version of letairis in june we filed lawsuit against sigmapharm in the district court for the district of new jersey we can not predict the ultimate outcome of the foregoing action and other litigation with generic manufacturer and we may spend significant resource enforcing and defending these patent if we are unsuccessful in these lawsuit some or all of our original claim in the patent may be narrowed or invalidated and the patent protection for truvada viread and letairis in the united state and atripla truvada and viread in canada could be substantially shortened further if all of the patent covering one or more product are invalidated fda or health canada could approve the request to manufacture generic version of such product in the united state or canada respectively prior to the expiration date of those patent the sale of version of these product earlier than their patent expiration would have significant negative effect on our revenue and result of operation we face credit risk from our emerging market and southern european customer that may adversely affect our result of operation we have exposure to customer credit risk in emerging market and southern europe southern european product sale to government owned or supported customer in southern europe specifically spain italy portugal and greece have historically been subject to significant payment delay due to government funding and reimbursement practice this ha resulted and may continue to result in day sale outstanding being significantly higher in these country due to the average length of time that account receivable remain outstanding of december our account receivable in southern europe specifically greece italy portugal and spain totaled approximately billion of which million were greater than day past due including million greater than day past due historically receivable balance with certain publicly owned hospital accumulate over period of time and are then subsequently settled large lump sum payment this pattern is also experienced by other pharmaceutical company that sell directly to hospital if significant change were to occur in the reimbursement practice of these european government or if government funding becomes unavailable we may not be able to collect on amount due to from these customer and our result of operation would be adversely affected our revenue and gross margin could be reduced by import from country where our product are available at lower price price for our product are based on local market economics and competition and sometimes differ from country to country our sale in country with relatively higher price may be reduced if product can be imported into those or other country from lower price market there have been case in which other pharmaceutical product were sold at steeply discounted price in the developing world and then exported to european country where they could be re sold at much higher price if this happens with our product particularly truvada and viread which we have agreed to make available at substantially reduced price to more than country participating in our gilead access program or atripla which merck distributes at substantially reduced price to hiv infected patient in developing country under our agreement our revenue would be adversely affected in addition we have established partnership with india based generic manufacturer to distribute generic version of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and taf contingent on regulatory approval to developing world country including india we expanded these agreement to include right to stribild tybost and vitekta we also entered into agreement with certain india based generic manufacturer to produce and distribute generic emtricitabine in the developing world including single tablet regimen containing emtricitabine and fixed dose combination of emtricitabine co formulated with our other hiv medicine starting in september we entered into licensing agreement with india based generic manufacturer to produce and distribute generic sofosbuvir and the fixed dose combination of ldv sof to developing country if generic version of our hiv and hcv medication under these license are then re exported to the united state europe or other market outside of these developing world country our revenue would be adversely affected part of our commitment to make sovaldi available in the developing world at discounted price we entered into an agreement to make sovaldi available in egypt country that ha among the highest hcv prevalence in the world if the discounted sovaldi is re exported from these developing country into the united state or other higher price market our revenue could be adversely affected in addition purchase of our product in country where our selling price are relatively low for resale in country in which our selling price are relatively high may adversely impact our revenue and gross margin and may cause our sale to fluctuate from quarter to quarter for example in the european union we are required to permit product purchased in one country to be sold in another country purchase of our product in country where our selling price are relatively low for resale in country in which our selling price are relatively high can affect the inventory level held by our wholesaler and can cause the relative sale level in the various country to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and not reflect the actual consumer demand in any given quarter these quarterly fluctuation may impact our earnings which could adversely affect our stock price and harm our business litigation and government investigation have increased our expense which may continue to reduce our earnings we are involved in number of litigation investigation and other dispute related matter that require to expend substantial internal and financial resource we expect these matter will continue to require high level of internal and financial resource for the foreseeable future these matter have reduced and will continue to reduce our earnings please see description of our litigation related to sofosbuvir and litigation with generic manufacturer in note commitment and contingency legal proceeding of the note to consolidated financial statement included in item of this annual report on form the outcome of such lawsuit or any other lawsuit that may be brought against the investigation or any other investigation that may be initiated are inherently uncertain and adverse development or outcome can result in significant expense monetary damage penalty or injunctive relief against that could significantly reduce our earnings and cash flow and harm our business in some country we may be required to grant compulsory license for our product or our patent may not be enforced in number of developing country government official and other interested group have suggested that pharmaceutical company should make drug for hcv or hiv infection available at low cost alternatively government in those developing country could require that we grant compulsory license to allow competitor to manufacture and sell their own version of our product thereby reducing our product sale for example there is growing attention on the availability of hcv therapy and some activist are advocating for the increased availability of hcv therapy through mean including compulsory license in the past certain office of the government of brazil have expressed concern over the affordability of our hiv product and declared that they were considering issuing compulsory license to permit the manufacture of otherwise patented product for hiv infection including viread in addition concern over the cost and availability of tamiflu related to potential avian flu pandemic and influenza generated international discussion over compulsory licensing of our tamiflu patent for example the canadian government considered allowing canadian manufacturer to manufacture and export the active ingredient in tamiflu to eligible developing and least developed country under canada access to medicine regime furthermore roche issued voluntary license to permit third party manufacturing of tamiflu for example roche granted sublicense to shanghai pharmaceutical group co ltd for china and sublicense to india hetero drug limited for india and certain developing country if compulsory license permit generic manufacturing to override our product patent for harvoni sovaldi our hiv product or tamiflu or if we are required to grant compulsory license for these product it could reduce our earnings and cash flow and harm our business in addition certain country do not permit enforcement of our patent and third party manufacturer are able to sell generic version of our product in those country for example in july the brazilian patent authority rejected our patent application for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate the active pharmaceutical ingredient in viread this wa the highest level of appeal available to within the brazilian patent authority because we do not currently have patent in brazil the brazilian government now purchase it supply of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate from generic manufacturer sale of generic version of our product could significantly reduce our sale and adversely affect our result of operation particularly if generic version of our product are imported into territory where we have existing commercial sale we may face significant liability resulting from our product that may not be covered by insurance and successful claim could materially reduce our earnings the testing manufacturing marketing and use of our commercial product well product candidate in development involve substantial risk of product liability claim these claim may be made directly by consumer healthcare provider pharmaceutical company or others we may be unable to maintain sufficient coverage for product liability that may arise in addition the cost to defend lawsuit or pay damage for product liability claim may exceed our coverage if we are unable to maintain adequate coverage or if claim exceed our coverage our financial condition and our ability to clinically test our product candidate and market our product will be adversely affected in addition negative publicity associated with any claim regardless of their merit may decrease the future demand for our product and impair our financial condition business disruption from natural or man made disaster may harm our future revenue our worldwide operation

reduce our earnings we are subject to income tax in both the united state and various foreign jurisdiction including ireland due to economic and political condition various country are actively considering change to existing tax law we can not predict the form or timing of potential legislative change that could have material adverse impact on our result of operation in addition significant

hcv new patient start ha diminished since the first quarter of indicative of the rapid initiation of treatment for many warehoused patient followed by flattening of patient in the remaining quarter we anticipate that the rate at which new patient start treatment in the second half of may be more indicative of the pace of new patient start in in europe we expect early launch market to stabilize and new market to ramp up treatment in japan patient number are difficult to predict because our hcv product were recently launched additionally we anticipate the government of japan will impose

resourceswe believe our existing capital resource supplemented by cash flow generated from our operation will be adequate to satisfy our capital need for the foreseeable future our future capital

preclinical study and clinical trial the cost timing and outcome of regulatory review the expansion of our sale and marketing capability administrative expense the possibility of acquiring additional manufacturing capability or office facility the possibility of acquiring other company or new product cost associated with the settlement and conversion of our convertible senior note and related warrant the establishment of additional collaborative relationship with other company and cost associated with the defense settlement and adverse result of litigation and government investigation we may in the future require additional funding which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financing if such funding is required we can not guarantee that it will be available to on favorable term if at all accounting policy estimate and judgment the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and result of operation is based on our consolidated financial statement which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle the preparation of these financial statement requires to make estimate and judgment that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense and related disclosure on an ongoing basis we evaluate and base our estimate on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumption that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance the result of which form the basis for making judgment about the carrying value of asset and liability that are not readily apparent from other source actual result may differ significantly from these estimate we believe the following critical accounting policy reflect the more significant judgment and estimate used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statement revenue recognition product sale we recognize revenue from product sale when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists delivery ha occurred the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured we record product sale net of estimated mandatory and supplemental discount to government payer in addition to discount to private payer and other related charge these are generally referred to gross to net deduction and are recorded in the same period the related sale occur government and other rebate and chargebacks represent the majority of our gross to net deduction and require complex and significant judgment by management estimate are assessed each period and updated to reflect current information government and other rebate and chargebacksgovernment and other rebate and chargebacks include amount paid to payer and healthcare provider in the united state including medicaid rebate adaps veteran administration and public health service discount and other rebate well foreign government rebate rebate and chargebacks are based on contractual arrangement or statutory requirement which may vary by product by payer and individual payer plan for qualified program that can purchase our product through wholesaler or other distributor at lower contractual price the wholesaler or distributor charge back to the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual price our consolidated allowance for government and other chargebacks that are payable to our direct customer are classified reduction of account receivable and totaled million of december and million of december our consolidated allowance for government and other rebate that will be paid to party other than our direct customer are recorded in accrued government and other rebate on our consolidated balance sheet and totaled billion of december and billion of december our allowance for government and other rebate and chargebacks are estimated based on product sold historical utilization rate pertinent third party industry information estimated patient population known market event or trend channel inventory data and or other market data we also consider new information regarding change in program regulation and guideline that would impact the amount of the actual rebate and or our expectation regarding future utilization rate for these program we believe that the methodology that we use to estimate our government and other rebate and chargebacks is reasonable and appropriate given the current fact and circumstance however actual result may differ significantly from our estimate during the last three year our actual government rebate and chargebacks claimed for prior period have varied by le than from our estimate following table summarizes the consolidated activity in our government and other rebate and chargebacks account in million accrued government and other rebate and chargebacks balance at beginning of year decrease increase to product sale payment balance at end of yearyear ended december activity related to sale related to sale prior to ended december activity related to sale related to sale prior to majority of the increase in accrued government and other rebate and chargebacks in compared to wa driven by the increase in sale volume in allowance for doubtful account we maintain an allowance for doubtful account for estimated loss resulting from the inability of our customer to make required payment this allowance is based on our analysis of several factor including but not limited to contractual payment term historical payment pattern of our customer and individual customer circumstance an analysis of day sale outstanding by geographic region and review of the local economic environment and it potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practice if the financial condition of our customer or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate resulting in an inability to make payment additional allowance may be required we believe that the allowance for doubtful account is adequate however significant deterioration in any of the above factor could materially change these expectation and may result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful account of december and our account receivable net were billion and billion and our allowance for doubtful account were million and million respectively valuation of intangible assetsin conjunction with our business combination we have recorded intangible asset primarily related to in process research and development ipr project we had total intangible asset of billion of december and billion of december the identifiable intangible asset are measured at their respective fair value of the acquisition date the model used in valuing these intangible asset require the use of significant estimate and assumption including but not limited to estimate of revenue and operating profit related to the product or product candidate the probability of success for unapproved product candidate considering their stage of development the time and resource needed to complete the development and approval of product candidate the life of the potential commercialized product and associated risk including the inherent difficulty and uncertainty in developing product candidate such obtaining fda and other regulatory approval and risk related to the viability of and potential alternative treatment in any future target market we believe the fair value used to record intangible asset acquired in connection with business combination are based upon reasonable estimate and assumption given the fact and circumstance of the related valuation date intangible asset related to ipr project are considered to be indefinite lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated effort if and when development is complete which generally occurs if and when regulatory approval to market product is obtained the associated asset would be deemed finite lived and would then be amortized based on their respective estimated useful life at that point in time during the period the asset are considered indefinite lived they will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment on an annual basis well between annual test if we become aware of any event or change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the ipr project below their respective carrying amount the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible asset is dependent on assumption such the expected timing or probability of achieving the specified milestone change in projected revenue or change in discount rate significant judgment is employed in determining these assumption and change to our assumption could have significant impact on our result of operation in any given period asset with finite useful life are amortized over their estimated useful life primarily on straight line basis intangible asset with finite useful life are reviewed for impairment when fact or circumstance suggest that the carrying value of these asset may not be recoverable tax provision we estimate our income tax provision including deferred tax asset and liability based on significant management judgment we evaluate the realization of all or portion of our deferred tax asset on quarterly basis we record valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset to the amount that are more likely than not to be realized we consider future taxable income ongoing tax planning strategy and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for valuation allowance if we expect to realize deferred tax asset for which we have previously recorded valuation allowance we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made we are subject to income tax in both the united state and various foreign jurisdiction including ireland due to economic and political condition various country are actively considering change to existing tax law we can not predict the form or timing of potential legislative change that could have material adverse impact on our result of operation in addition significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income tax we record liability related to uncertain tax position in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax recognized in an enterprise financial statement by prescribing minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax position taken or expected to be taken in tax return we do not believe any such uncertain tax position currently pending will have material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statement although an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax position in any period could have material impact on the result of operation for that period at december and we had total federal state and foreign unrecognized tax benefit of billion and million respectively of the total unrecognized tax benefit billion and million at december and respectively if recognized would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition of december we believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefit will decrease by approximately million in the next month we expect to have clarification from the irs and other tax authority regarding our uncertain tax position with respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefit we are currently unable to make reasonable estimate to the period of cash settlement if any with the respective tax authority we file federal state and foreign income tax return in many jurisdiction in the united state and abroad for federal income tax purpose the statute of limitation is open for and onwards for certain acquired entity the statute of limitation is open for all year from inception due to our utilization of their net operating loss and credit carried over from prior year for california income tax purpose the statute of limitation is open for and onwards our income tax return are subject to audit by federal state and foreign tax authority we are currently under examination by the irs for the and tax year and by various state and foreign jurisdiction there are differing interpretation of tax law and regulation and result significant dispute may arise with these tax authority involving issue of the timing and amount of deduction and allocation of income among various tax jurisdiction we periodically evaluate our exposure associated with our tax filing position off balance sheet arrangement we do not have any off balance sheet arrangement defined in item ii of regulation obligationsour contractual obligation consist of debt obligation operating lease capital commitment purchase obligation for active pharmaceutical ingredient and inventory related item and clinical trial contract the following table summarizes our significant enforceable and legally binding obligation future commitment and obligation related to all contract that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that certain of these obligation may be cancelable of december in million payment due by periodcontractual obligation total le than oneyear year year more than lease obligation commitment purchase obligation trial our debt obligation include senior unsecured note and convertible senior note interest payment are incurred and calculated based on term of the related note for further information see item note debt and credit facility in our consolidated financial statement included in this annual report on form at december we had firm capital project commitment of approximately million primarily relating to construction of new building at december we had firm purchase commitment related to active pharmaceutical ingredient and certain inventory related item these amount include minimum purchase requirement in addition to the above we have committed to make potential future milestone payment to third party part of licensing collaboration and development arrangement payment under these agreement generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental regulatory and or commercial milestone because the achievement of these milestone is neither probable nor reasonably estimable such contingency have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and have not been included in the table above at december we had several clinical study in various clinical trial phase our most significant clinical trial expenditure are to contract research organization cro although all of our material contract with cro are cancelable we historically have not canceled such contract these amount reflect commitment based on existing contract and do not reflect any future modification to or termination of existing contract or anticipated or potential new contract we had total gross unrecognized tax benefit liability including interest and penalty of billion of december we believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefit will decrease by approximately million in the next month we expect to have clarification from the irs and other tax authority regarding our uncertain tax position with respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefit we are currently unable to make reasonable estimate to the period of cash settlement if any with the respective tax authority the unrecognized tax benefit were included in current and long term income tax payable and long term deferred tax asset on our consolidated balance sheet and have not been included in the table above recent accounting pronouncement the information required by this item is included in item note organization and summary of significant accounting policy in our consolidated financial statement included in this annual report on form item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskwe are exposed to market risk that may result from change in foreign currency exchange rate interest rate and credit risk to reduce certain of these risk we enter into various type of foreign currency or interest rate derivative hedging transaction follow investment guideline and monitor outstanding receivables part of our risk management program foreign currency exchange risk our operation include manufacturing and sale activity in the united state canada and ireland well sale activity in country outside the united state including europe and asia pacific result our financial result could be significantly affected by factor such change in foreign currency exchange rate or weak economic condition in the foreign market in which we distribute our product our operating result are exposed to change in foreign currency exchange rate the dollar and various foreign currency the most significant of which are the euro and yen when the dollar strengthens against these currency the relative value of sale made in the respective foreign currency decrease conversely when the dollar weakens against these currency the relative amount of such sale increase overall we are net receiver of foreign currency and therefore benefit from weaker dollar and are adversely affected by stronger dollar relative to those foreign currency in which we transact significant amount of business approximately of our product sale were denominated in foreign currency during to partially mitigate the impact of change in currency exchange rate on net cash flow from our foreign currency denominated sale we may enter into foreign currency exchange forward and option contract we also hedge certain monetary asset and liability denominated in foreign currency which reduces but doe not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuation between the date transaction is recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid in general the market risk of these contract are offset by corresponding gain and loss on the transaction being hedged of december and we had open foreign currency forward contract with notional amount of billion and billion respectively hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rate compared with the dollar relative to exchange rate at december would have resulted in reduction in fair value of these contract of approximately million on this date and if realized would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contract the same hypothetical movement in foreign currency exchange rate compared with the dollar relative to exchange rate at december would have resulted in reduction in fair value of these contract of approximately million on this date and if realized would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contract the analysis doe not consider the impact that hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rate would have on anticipated transaction that these foreign currency sensitive instrument were designed to offset interest rate risk our portfolio of available for sale marketable security and our fixed and variable rate liability create an exposure to interest rate risk with respect to our investment portfolio we adhere to an investment policy that requires to limit amount invested in security based on credit rating maturity industry group and investment type and issuer except for security issued by the government the goal of our investment policy in order of priority are follows safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk liquidity of investment sufficient to meet cash flow requirement and competitive after tax rate of return the following table summarizes the expected maturity and average interest rate of our interest generating asset and fixed interest bearing liability at december in million except percentage expected maturity total fair value thereafter total asset available for sale debt security interest rate liability debt interest rate of december our debt consisted of senior unsecured note and convertible senior note with an aggregate carrying value of billion since these instrument bear interest at fixed rate change in interest rate do not affect interest expense or cash flow however the fair value of these instrument fluctuates when interest rate change see note debt and credit facility in our consolidated financial statement included in this

the security issuer the number of security in an unrealized loss position the severity and duration of the unrealized loss whether we have the intent to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of their amortized cost basis when we determine that the decline in fair value of an investment is below our accounting basis and this decline is other than temporary we reduce the carrying value of the security we hold and record loss for the amount of such decline result of entering into collaboration from time to time we may hold investment in non public company we record these nonmarketable security at cost in other long term asset le any amount for other than temporary impairment we regularly review our security for

until the completion or abandonment of the associated effort if and when development is complete which generally occurs if and when regulatory approval to market product is obtained the associated asset are deemed finite lived and are amortized based on their respective estimated useful life at that point in time we test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment on an annual basis and in between annual test if we become aware of any event or change that would indicate the fair value of the asset are below their carrying amount intangible asset with finite useful life are amortized over their estimated useful life primarily on straight line basis and are reviewed for impairment when fact or circumstance suggest that the carrying value of these asset may not be recoverable of long lived asset long lived asset including property plant and equipment and finite lived intangible asset are reviewed for impairment on regular basis and whenever fact or circumstance either internally or externally may suggest that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable should there be an indication of impairment we test for recoverability by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flow expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and it eventual disposition to the carrying amount of the asset or asset group any

and we hedge portion of our foreign currency exposure related to outstanding monetary asset and liability well forecasted product sale using foreign currency exchange forward and option contract in general the market risk related to these contract is offset by corresponding gain and loss on the hedged transaction the credit risk associated with these contract is driven by change in interest and currency exchange rate and result varies over time by working only with major bank and closely monitoring current market condition we seek to limit the risk that counterparties to these contract may be unable to perform we also seek to limit our risk of loss by entering into contract that permit net settlement at maturity therefore our overall risk of loss in the event of counterparty default is limited to the amount of any unrecognized gain on outstanding contract those contract that have positive fair value at the date of default we do not enter into derivative contract for trading purpose nor do we hedge our net investment in any of our foreign subsidiary fair value of financial instrument we apply fair value accounting for all financial asset and liability and non financial asset and liability that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statement on recurring basis we define fair value the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date when determining the fair value measurement for asset and liability which are required to be recorded at fair value we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market based risk measurement or assumption that market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability such risk inherent in valuation technique transfer restriction and credit risk derivative financial instrumentswe recognize all derivative instrument either asset or liability at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet change in the fair value of derivative are recorded each period in current earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income loss depending on whether derivative is designated part of hedge transaction and if it is the type of hedge transaction we classify the cash flow from these instrument in the same category the cash flow from the hedged item we do not hold or issue derivative instrument for trading or speculative purpose we ass both at inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivative that are used in hedging transaction are highly effective in offsetting the change in cash flow or fair value of the hedged item we also ass hedge ineffectiveness on quarterly basis and record the gain or loss related to the ineffective portion to current earnings to the extent significant if we determine that forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring we discontinue hedge accounting for the affected portion of the hedge instrument and any related unrealized gain or loss on the contract is recognized in current earnings income tax our income tax provision is computed under the liability method deferred tax asset and liability are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of asset and liability using enacted tax rate in effect for the year in which the difference are expected to reverse significant estimate are required in determining our provision for income tax some of these estimate are based on interpretation of existing tax law or regulation we record liability related to uncertain tax position in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax recognized in an enterprise financial statement by prescribing minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax position taken or expected to be taken in tax return we do not believe any such uncertain tax position currently pending will have material adverse effect our consolidated financial statement although an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax position in any period could have material impact on the result of operation for that period branded prescription drug bpd feewe along with other pharmaceutical manufacturer of branded drug product are required to pay portion of the bpd fee which is calculated based on select government sale during each calendar year percentage of total industry government sale in the internal revenue service irs issued final regulation related

our consolidated financial statement in april the fasb issued an accounting standard update which requires presentation of debt issuance cost direct deduction from the carrying amount of recognized debt liability on the balance sheet the update doe not change the guidance on the recognition and measurement of debt issuance cost this guidance will become effective for beginning in the first quarter of at the time of adoption we will reclassify debt issuance cost to liability direct deduction from the carrying value of the debt consistent with the presentation of debt discount we do not expect that the adoption of this update will have material impact on our consolidated balance sheet in november the fasb issued an accounting standard update which requires that deferred tax liability and asset be classified noncurrent on the balance sheet previous guidance required deferred tax liability and asset to be separated into current and noncurrent amount on the balance sheet the guidance

effective for beginning in the first quarter of early adoption is permitted we are evaluating the impact of adopting this accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statement fair value measurement we determine the fair value of financial and non financial asset and liability using the fair value hierarchy which establishes three level of input that may be used to measure fair value follows level input which include quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability level input which include observable input other than level input such quoted price for similar asset or liability quoted price for identical or similar asset or liability in market that are not active or other input that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability for our marketable security we review trading activity and pricing of the measurement date when sufficient quoted pricing for identical security is not available we use market pricing and other observable market input for similar security obtained from various third party data provider these input either represent quoted price for similar asset in active market or have been derived from observable market data and level input which include unobservable input that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the underlying asset or liability our level asset and liability include those whose value measurement are determined using pricing model discounted cash flow methodology or similar valuation technique and significant management judgment or estimation our financial instrument consist principally of cash and cash equivalent marketable security account receivable foreign currency

the proceeding upon idenix request the french proceeding have been stayed idenix ha not been awarded patent corresponding to the patent in japan or china in the event such patent are issued we expect

european patent covering sofosbuvir that expires in while we are confident in the strength of our sofosbuvir patent we can not predict the ultimate outcome of these opposition if we are unsuccessful in defending these opposition some or all of our patent claim may be narrowed or revoked and the patent protection for sofosbuvir in europe could be substantially shortened or eliminated entirely if the sofosbuvir patent is revoked and no other european patent are granted covering sofosbuvir our exclusivity will be based entirely on regulatory exclusivity granted by the european medicine agency ema sovaldi ha been granted regulatory exclusivity that will prevent generic sofosbuvir from entering the european union for year following approval of sovaldi or january if we lose exclusivity for
