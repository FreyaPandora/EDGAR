cycle for the commodity such certain agricultural and food product that have specific growing and harvesting season the peak shipping season for these commodity vary considerably each year depending upon various factor including the strength of domestic and international economy and currency and the strength of harvest and market price for agricultural product in response to an annual request from the surface transportation board stb to all of the class railroad operating in the we submit publicly available letter during the third quarter detailing our plan for handling traffic during the third and fourth quarter each year and provide other information requested by the stb working capital at december and we modest working capital surplus which provides enhanced liquidity in addition we believe we have adequate access to capital market to meet any foreseeable cash requirement and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liability competition we are subject to competition from other railroad motor carrier ship and barge operator and pipeline our main railroad competitor is burlington northern santa fe llc it primary subsidiary bnsf railway company bnsf operates parallel route in many of our main traffic corridor in addition we operate in corridor served by other railroad and motor carrier motor carrier competition exists for five of our six commodity group excluding most coal shipment of the proximity of our route to major inland and gulf coast waterway barge can be particularly competitive especially for grain and bulk commodity in certain area where we operate in addition to price competition we face competition with respect to transit time quality and reliability of service from motor carrier and other railroad motor carrier in particular can have an advantage over railroad with respect to transit time and timeliness of service however railroad are much fuel efficient than truck which reduces the impact of transporting good on the environment and public infrastructure and we have been making effort to convert certain truck traffic to rail additionally we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system truck and barge are able to use public right of way maintained by public entity any of the following could also affect the competitiveness of our transportation service for some or all of our commodity improvement or expenditure materially increasing the quality or reducing the cost of these alternative mode of transportation ii legislation that eliminates or significantly reduces the size or weight limitation applied to motor carrier or iii legislation or regulatory change that impose operating restriction on railroad or that adversely affect the profitability of some or all railroad traffic finally many movement face product or geographic competition where our customer can use different product natural gas instead of coal sorghum instead of corn or commodity from different location grain from state or country that we do not serve crude oil from different region sourcing different commodity or different location allows shipper to substitute different carrier and such competition may reduce our volume or constrain price for more information regarding risk we face from competition see the risk factor in item of this report key supplier we depend on two key domestic supplier of high horsepower locomotive due to the capital intensive nature of the locomotive manufacturing business and sophistication of this equipment potential new supplier face high barrier of entry into this industry therefore if one of these domestic supplier discontinues manufacturing locomotive for any reason including insolvency or bankruptcy we could experience significant cost increase and risk reduced availability of the locomotive that are necessary to our operation additionally for high percentage of our rail purchase we utilize two steel producer one domestic and one international that meet our specification rail is critical for maintenance replacement improvement and expansion of our network and facility rail manufacturing also ha high barrier of entry and if one of supplier discontinues operation for any reason including insolvency or bankruptcy we could experience cost increase and difficulty obtaining rail employee approximately of our full time equivalent employee are

adverse impact on our result of operation financial condition and liquidity the availability of qualified personnel could adversely affect our operation change in demographic training requirement and the availability of qualified personnel could negatively affect our ability to meet demand for rail service unpredictable increase in demand for rail service and lack of network fluidity may exacerbate such risk which could have negative impact on our operational efficiency and otherwise have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and liquidity we may be affected by fluctuating fuel price fuel cost constitute significant portion of our transportation expense diesel fuel price can be subject to dramatic fluctuation and significant price increase could have material adverse effect on our operating result although we currently are able to recover significant amount of our fuel expense from our customer through revenue from fuel surcharge we can not be certain that we will always be able to mitigate rising or elevated fuel cost through our fuel surcharge additionally future market condition or legislative or regulatory activity could adversely affect our ability to apply fuel surcharge or adequately recover increased fuel cost through fuel surcharge fuel price fluctuate our fuel surcharge program trail such fluctuation in fuel price by approximately two month and may be significant source of quarter over quarter and year over year volatility particularly in period of rapidly changing price international political and economic factor event and condition affect the volatility of fuel price and supply weather can also affect fuel supply and limit domestic refining capacity severe shortage of or disruption to domestic fuel supply

to be uncertain in the current environment we could see volatile fuel price during the year they are sensitive to global and domestic demand refining capacity geopolitical event weather condition and other factor price fluctuate there will be timing impact on earnings our fuel surcharge program trail fluctuation in fuel price by approximately two month continuing lower fuel price could have positive impact on the economy by increasing consumer discretionary spending that potentially could increase demand for various consumer product that we transport alternatively lower fuel price will likely have negative impact on other commodity such coal frac sand and crude oil shipment capital plan in we expect our capital plan to be approximately billion including expenditure for ptc locomotive and freight car the capital plan may be revised if business condition warrant or if new law or regulation affect our ability to generate sufficient return on these investment see further discussion in this item under liquidity and capital resource capital plan financial expectation economic condition in many of our market sector continue to drive uncertainty with respect to our volume level we expect volume to be slightly in compared to but will depend on the overall economy and market condition the strong dollar and historic low commodity price could also drive continued volatility one of the biggest uncertainty is the outlook for energy market which will bring both challenge and opportunity in the current environment we expect continued margin improvement driven by continued pricing opportunity ongoing productivity initiative and the ability to leverage our resource and strengthen our franchise over the longer term we expect the overall economy to continue to

industrial chemical and plastic shipment freight revenue from all six commodity group increased during compared to driven by volume growth and core pricing gain of volume growth from grain frac sand rock and intermodal domestic and international shipment offset decline in crude oil our fuel surcharge program generated freight revenue of billion billion and billion in and respectively fuel surcharge revenue in decreased billion result of decrease in fuel price and reduction in carloadings fuel surcharge revenue in increased based on our carloadings increase in other revenue decreased from due to lower revenue at our subsidiary primarily those that broker intermodal and automotive service partially offset by higher accessorial revenue driven by increased revenue for container usage and demurrage fee in other revenue increased from due to higher revenue at our subsidiary primarily those that broker intermodal and automotive service accessorial revenue driven by increased volume

automotive chemical coal industrial product intermodal total change change average revenue per car agricultural product automotive chemical coal industrial product intermodal average each intermodal container or trailer equal one carload agricultural product lower fuel surcharge revenue and volume decline partially offset by core pricing gain decreased freight revenue from agricultural shipment in compared to grain shipment decreased in compared to the strength of the dollar lower grain commodity price and higher worldwide inventory contributed to the reduction in overall demand higher volume and pricing gain drove the increase in freight revenue from agricultural shipment in versus grain shipment increased reflecting the strong overall harvest in and the agricultural product carload drought also negatively impacted the first three quarter of which created favorable comparison for the first three quarter of lower export wheat shipment due to larger world crop partially offset gain in grain automotive freight revenue from automotive shipment increased compared to driven by volume growth and core pricing gain which were partially offset by lower fuel surcharge revenue higher automotive production and record sale level drove the volume growth freight revenue from automotive shipment increased in compared to growth in automotive part and finished vehicle shipment and core price improvement drove the higher revenue the increase in automotive part volume wa driven by continued strength in production and market penetration finished vehicle shipment increased the last three automotive carload quarter of with improved sale and production which offset decline in the first quarter due to winter weather shift in business mix and change in we are compensated for container usage which is included per diem charge in other revenue negatively impacted arc compared to chemical freight revenue from chemical shipment declined in versus due to lower fuel surcharge revenue and volume decline which more than offset core price improvement crude oil shipment declined result of the drop in crude oil price and production decline from various shale formation which impacted the regional pricing difference for crude oil lower fertilizer shipment also decreased freight revenue in strength in export plastic market and industrial chemical shipment helped offset the decline in crude oil and fertilizer shipment core price improvement higher volume and chemical carload arc driven by positive business mix increased freight revenue from chemical in compared to shipment of industrial chemical grew result of continued strong demand in the drilling market fertilizer shipment increased due to strong export of potash reduced shipment of crude oil from the bakken and permian shale formation to the gulf area partially offset these gain market factor primarily regional pricing difference for various type of crude oil displaced some of the former gulf coast shipment to the east and west coast coal lower volume and fuel surcharge revenue partially offset by core pricing gain drove the decline in freight revenue from coal shipment in compared to shipment of the southern powder river basin sprb declined in result of depressed coal market due to low natural gas price and high inventory level shipment out of the sprb also were negatively impacted heavy rain in june flooded coal mine and washed out track in some area impacting both second and third quarter shipment shipment out of colorado and utah declined in primarily due to lower domestic demand for colorado and utah coal carload coal this lower demand wa result of several utility switching to other fuel source due to lower natural gas price in addition coal export declined due to soft global market freight revenue from coal shipment increased in compared to driven by higher volume shift in business mix negatively impacted arc compared to sprb shipment increased from strong demand continued throughout the year due to inventory replenishment but network performance and contract loss limited year over year volume growth shipment from colorado and utah mine increased compared to driven by higher natural gas price for most of the year and strong export through the west coast however in the fourth quarter volume from colorado and utah mine declined export to the gulf coast decreased industrial product freight revenue from industrial product shipment decreased in compared to due to volume decline lower fuel surcharge revenue and lower arc due to the mix of traffic partially offset by core price improvement decline in shale drilling activity due to lower oil price decreased non metallic mineral shipment primarily frac sand carloadings steel shipment also declined result of reduction in shale drilling activity low commodity price and increased import associated with the strength of the dollar low commodity price for lumber and the strong dollar resulted in inventory reduction that reduced lumber shipment industrial product carload volume growth core pricing gain and positive business mix in increased freight revenue for industrial product shipment versus shipment of non metallic mineral primarily frac sand up grew result of drilling activity for energy product well evolving drilling practice which can increase the amount of frac sand used at certain well additionally rock and lumber shipment increased from driven by new housing and commercial construction intermodal lower fuel surcharge revenue and volume decline partially offset by core pricing gain resulted in decline in freight revenue from intermodal shipment in compared to international shipment declined resulting from the supply chain disruption stemming from the west coast port work disruption and historically high retail inventory domestic volume increased driven by continued conversion from truck and new premium service more than offsetting the impact of high retail inventory level and modest retail sale activity freight revenue from intermodal shipment increased in compared to driven by intermodal carload volume growth core pricing improvement and positive business mix domestic traffic increased due to continued conversion from truck transportation to rail and new premium service international traffic grew versus driven primarily by new business and improving economic condition international gain in the last three quarter of the year offset the decline in the first quarter due to severe weather that negatively impacted consumer demand mexico business each of our commodity group includes revenue from shipment to and from mexico freight revenue from mexico business decreased to billion in compared to primarily due to lower fuel surcharge revenue volume level were flat compared to lower shipment of intermodal agricultural and industrial product were offset by growth in automotive coal and chemical shipment revenue from mexico business increased to billion in versus volume level increased from increase in agricultural product chemical intermodal automotive and industrial product offset lower export coal shipment operating expense change change million compensation and benefit purchased service and material fuel depreciation equipment and other rent other total operating expense decreased nearly billion compared to driven by significantly lower fuel price and volume related cost saving productivity gain in the second half of the year also drove expense lower these decrease were partially offset by wage inflation higher depreciation and property tax in addition we incurred approximately million of weather related cost in operating expense increased million in versus volume related expense incremental cost associated with operating slower network depreciation wage and benefit inflation and locomotive and freight car operating expense material contributed to the higher cost lower fuel price partially offset these increase in addition there were approximately million of weather related cost in the first quarter of compensation and benefit compensation and benefit include wage payroll tax health and welfare cost pension cost other postretirement benefit and incentive cost in lower volume related cost and second half productivity gain were more than offset by general wage inflation and increased hiring and training expense related to larger workforce in the first half of the year volume related expense including training and slower network increased our train and engine work force which along with general wage and benefit inflation resulted in increased wage in compared to weather related cost in the first quarter of also increased cost purchased service and material expense for purchased service and material includes the cost of service purchased from outside contractor and other service provider including equipment maintenance and contract expense

decreased million compared to primarily due to lower volume related cost including decrease in external transportation expense incurred by our logistics subsidiary expense also decreased due to lower locomotive and freight car repair cost expense for purchased service in increased compared to primarily due to volume related expense incurred by our logistics subsidiary for external transportation and increased crew transportation and lodging due to volume and slower network in addition higher consulting fee and higher contract expense including equipment maintenance increased cost compared to locomotive and freight car material expense increased in compared to due to additional volume including the impact of activating stored equipment to address operational issue caused by demand and slower network fuel fuel includes locomotive fuel and gasoline for highway and non highway vehicle and heavy equipment locomotive diesel fuel price which averaged per gallon including tax and transportation cost in compared to per gallon in decreased expense billion in addition fuel cost were lower gross ton mile decreased the fuel consumption rate rate computed gallon of fuel consumed divided by gross ton mile in thousand increased compared to decrease in heavier more fuel efficient shipment decreased gross ton mile and increased the rate volume growth of measured by gross ton mile drove the increase in fuel expense in compared to this wa essentially offset by lower locomotive diesel fuel price which averaged per gallon including tax and transportation cost in compared to in along with slight improvement in rate computed gallon of fuel consumed divided by gross ton mile depreciation the majority of depreciation relates to road property including rail tie ballast and other track material higher depreciable asset base reflecting higher capital spending in recent year increased depreciation expense in compared to this increase wa partially offset by our recent depreciation study that resulted in lower depreciation rate for some asset class depreciation wa up in compared to higher depreciable asset base reflecting higher ongoing capital spending drove the increase equipment and other rent equipment and other rent expense primarily includes rental expense that the railroad pay for freight car owned by other railroad or private company freight car intermodal and locomotive lease and office and other rent expense equipment and other rent expense decreased million compared to primarily from decrease in manifest and intermodal shipment partially offset by growth in finished vehicle shipment higher intermodal volume and longer cycle time increased short term freight car rental expense in compared to lower equipment lease essentially offset the higher freight car rental expense we exercised purchase option on some of our leased equipment other other expense include state and local tax freight equipment and property damage utility insurance personal injury environmental employee travel telephone and cellular computer software bad debt and other general expense other expense were flat in compared to higher property tax were offset by lower cost in other area higher property tax personal injury expense and utility cost partially offset by lower environmental expense and cost associated with damaged freight resulted in an increase in other cost in compared to non operating item change change million other income interest expense income tax other income other income increased in compared to primarily due to million gain from

increase in debt from december liquidity and capital resource of december our principal source of liquidity included cash cash equivalent our receivables securitization facility and our revolving credit facility well the availability of commercial paper and other source of financing through the capital market we had billion of committed credit available under our credit facility with no borrowing outstanding of december we did not make any borrowing under this facility during the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investor under the million capacity receivables securitization facility wa million of december and is included in our consolidated statement of financial position debt due after one year our access to this receivables securitization facility may be reduced or restricted if our bond rating fall to certain level below investment grade if our bond rating were to deteriorate it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity access to commercial paper well other capital market financing is dependent on market condition deterioration of our operating result or financial condition due to internal or external factor could negatively impact our ability to access capital market source of liquidity access to liquidity through the capital market is also dependent on our financial stability we expect that we will continue to have access to liquidity through any or all of the following source or activity increasing the size or utilization of our receivables securitization ii issuing commercial paper iii entering into bank loan outside of our revolving credit facility or iv issuing bond or other debt security to public or private investor based on our assessment of the current condition of the credit market the company billion revolving credit facility is intended to support the issuance of commercial paper by upc and also serf an emergency source of liquidity the company currently doe not intend to make any borrowing under this facility at december and we had modest working capital surplus this reflects strong cash position that provides enhanced liquidity in an uncertain economic environment in addition we believe we have adequate access to capital market to meet any foreseeable cash requirement and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liability cash flow million cash provided by operating activity cash used in investing activity cash used in financing activity net change in cash and cash equivalent operating activity cash provided by operating activity decreased in compared to due to lower net income and change in working capital partially offset by the timing of tax payment federal tax law provided for bonus depreciation for qualified investment made during and bonus depreciation for qualified investment made during result the company deferred substantial portion of it income tax expense contributing to the positive operating cash flow in those year congress extended bonus depreciation for but this extension occurred in december and the related benefit wa realized in rather than similarly in december of congress extended bonus depreciation through which delayed the benefit of bonus depreciation into bonus depreciation will be at rate of for and for and for higher net income in increased cash provided by operating activity compared to despite higher income tax payment income tax payment were higher than primarily due to higher income but also because we paid tax previously deferred by bonus depreciation investing activity higher capital investment in locomotive and freight car including million in early lease buyout which we exercised due to favorable economic term and market condition drove the increase in cash used in investing activity in compared to higher capital investment including the early buyout of the long term operating lease of our headquarters building for approximately million drove the increase in cash used in investing activity in compared to significant investment also were made for new locomotive freight car and container and capacity and commercial facility project capital investment in also included million for the early buyout of locomotive and freight car under long term operating lease which we exercised due to favorable economic term and market condition the following table detail cash capital investment

building operating lease in track mile of rail replaced track mile of rail capacity expansion new tie installed thousand mile of track surfaced capital plan in we expect our capital plan to be approximately billion which may be revised if business condition or the regulatory environment affect our ability to generate sufficient return on these investment while asset replacement will fluctuate part of our renewal strategy we expect to use to of our capital investment to renew and improve existing capital asset we will continue to invest in our network and terminal where appropriate balancing terminal capacity with mainline capacity significant investment in technology improvement are planned including approximately million for ptc we will also continue commercial investment in rail facility and equipment including locomotive and freight car we expect to fund our cash capital plan by using some or all of the following cash generated from operation proceeds from the sale or lease of various operating and non operating property proceeds from the issuance of long term debt and cash on hand our annual capital plan is critical component of our long term strategic plan we expect our plan will enhance the long term value of the company for our shareholder by providing sufficient resource to replace and improve our existing track infrastructure to provide safe

financing activity cash used in financing activity increased in compared to an increase of million in dividend paid and million for the repurchase of share under our common stock repurchase program more than offset an increase of million in debt issued and decrease of million in debt repaid the higher dividend payment primarily were result of adjusting the dividend payable date to align with the timing of the quarterly dividend declaration and payment within the same quarter aligning the quarterly dividend declaration and payment resulted in two payment in the first quarter of the fourth quarter dividend of million which wa paid on january well the first quarter dividend of million which wa paid on march the second quarter dividend of million wa paid on june the third quarter dividend of million wa paid on september and the fourth quarter dividend of million wa paid on december higher dividend per share also contributed to the increase in dividend paid cash used in financing activity remained flat in versus increase for the repurchase of share under our common stock repurchase program and higher dividend payment in of billion compared to billion in were offset by higher debt issuance in credit facility at december we had billion of credit available under our revolving credit facility the facility which is designated for general corporate purpose and support the

benefit under title iv of erisa at december the debt to net worth coverage ratio allowed to carry up to billion of debt defined in the facility and we had billion of debt defined in the facility outstanding at that date under our current capital plan we expect to continue to satisfy the debt to net worth coverage ratio however many factor beyond our reasonable control could affect our ability to comply with this provision in the future the facility doe not include any other financial restriction credit rating trigger other than rating dependent pricing or any other provision that could require to post collateral the facility also includes million cross default provision and change of control provision during we did not issue or repay any commercial paper and at december and we had

emergency board and congressional intervention are exhausted contract negotiation historically continue for an extended period of time and we rarely experience work stoppage while negotiation are pending inflation long period of inflation significantly increase asset replacement cost for capital intensive company result assuming that we replace all operating asset at current price level depreciation charge on an inflation adjusted basis would be substantially greater than historically reported amount derivative financial instrument we may use derivative financial instrument in limited instance to assist in managing our overall exposure to fluctuation in interest rate and fuel price we are not party to leveraged derivative and by policy do not use derivative financial instrument for speculative purpose derivative financial instrument qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged both at inception and throughout the hedged period we formally document the nature and relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item at inception well our risk management objective strategy for undertaking the various hedge transaction and method of assessing hedge effectiveness change in the fair market value of derivative financial instrument that do not qualify for hedge accounting are charged to earnings we may use swap collar future and or forward contract to mitigate the risk of adverse movement in interest rate and fuel price however the use of these derivative financial instrument may limit future benefit from favorable price movement market and credit risk we address market risk related to derivative financial instrument by selecting instrument with value fluctuation that highly correlate with the underlying hedged item we manage credit risk related to derivative financial instrument which is minimal by requiring high credit standard for counterparties and periodic settlement at december and we were not required to provide collateral nor had we received collateral relating to our hedging activity determination of fair value we determine the fair value of our derivative financial instrument position based upon current fair value quoted by recognized dealer or the present value of expected future cash flow sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical change in interest rate could have on our result of operation and financial condition these hypothetical change do not consider other factor that could impact actual result at december we had variable rate debt representing approximately of our total debt if variable interest rate average one percentage point higher in than our december variable rate which wa approximately our interest expense would increase by approximately million this amount wa determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate on the balance of our variable rate debt at december market risk for fixed rate debt is estimated the potential increase in fair value resulting from hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rate of december and amount to an increase of approximately billion to the fair value of our debt at december we estimated the fair value of our fixed rate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate on quoted market price and current borrowing rate interest rate fair value hedge we manage our overall exposure to fluctuation in interest rate by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instrument within our debt portfolio over given period we generally manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt through the issuance of targeted amount of each debt matures or we require incremental borrowing we employ derivative primarily swap one of the tool to obtain the targeted mix in addition we also obtain flexibility in managing interest cost and the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding callable fixed rate debt security swap allow to convert debt from fixed rate to variable rate and thereby hedge the risk of change in the debt fair value attributable to the change in interest rate we account for swap fair value hedge using the short cut method allowed by the derivative and hedging topic of the financial accounting standard board fasb asc therefore we do not record any ineffectiveness within our consolidated financial statement of december and we had no interest rate fair value hedge outstanding interest rate cash flow hedge we report change in the fair value of cash flow hedge in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item affect earnings of december and we had no interest rate cash flow hedge outstanding accounting pronouncement in may the fasb issued accounting standard update no asu revenue from contract with

not fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claim on our consolidated result of operation financial condition or liquidity to the extent possible we have recorded liability where asserted and unasserted claim are considered probable and where such claim can be reasonably estimated we do not expect that any known lawsuit claim environmental cost commitment contingent liability

for these matter indemnity our maximum potential exposure under indemnification arrangement including certain tax indemnification can range from specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount depending on the nature of the transaction and the agreement due to uncertainty to whether claim will be made or how they will be resolved we can not reasonably determine the probability of an adverse

material payment under these indemnity provision climate change although climate change could have an adverse impact on our operation and financial performance in the future see risk factor under item of this report we are currently unable to predict the manner or severity of such impact however we continue to take step and explore opportunity to reduce the impact of our operation on the environment including investment in new technology using training program to reduce fuel consumption and changing our operation to increase fuel efficiency critical accounting policy our consolidated financial statement have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statement requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amount of revenue expense asset and liability we base our estimate on historical experience and on various other assumption that we believe are reasonable under the circumstance the result of which form the basis for making judgment about the carrying value of asset and liability that are not readily apparent from other source the following critical accounting policy are subset of our significant accounting policy described in note to the financial statement and supplementary data item these critical accounting policy affect significant area of our financial statement and involve judgment and estimate if these estimate differ significantly from actual result the impact on our consolidated financial statement may be material personal injury the cost of personal injury to employee and others related to our activity is charged to expense based on estimate of the ultimate cost and number of incident each year we use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability including unasserted claim the federal employer liability act fela governs compensation for work related accident under fela damage are assessed based on finding of fault through litigation or out of court settlement we offer comprehensive variety of service and rehabilitation program for employee who are injured at work our personal injury liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payment approximately of the recorded liability is related to asserted claim and approximately is related to unasserted claim at december because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claim it is reasonably possible that future cost to settle these claim may range from approximately million to million we record an accrual at the low end of the range no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other estimate can vary over time due to evolving trend in litigation our personal injury liability activity wa follows million beginning balance current year accrual change in estimate for prior year payment ending balance at december current portion ending balance at december our personal injury claim activity wa follows open claim beginning balance new claim settled or dismissed claim open claim ending balance at december in conjunction with the liability update performed in we also reassessed our estimated insurance recovery we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recovery at december and asbestos we are defendant in number of lawsuit in which current and former employee and other party allege exposure to asbestos we ass our potential liability using statistical analysis of resolution cost for asbestos related claim this liability is updated annually and excludes future defense and processing cost the liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claim wa based on the following assumption the ratio of future claim by alleged disease would be consistent with historical average adjusted for inflation the number of claim filed against will decline each year the average settlement value for asserted and unasserted claim will be equivalent to historical average the percentage of claim dismissed in the future will be equivalent to historical average our liability for asbestos related claim is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payment approximately of the recorded liability related to asserted claim and approximately related to unasserted claim at december because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of asbestos related claim it is reasonably possible that future cost to settle these claim may range from approximately million to million we record an accrual at the low end of the range no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other our asbestos related liability activity wa follows million beginning balance accrual credit payment ending balance at december current portion ending balance at december our asbestos related claim activity wa follows open claim beginning balance new claim settled or dismissed claim open claim ending balance at december in conjunction with the liability update performed in we also reassessed our estimated insurance recovery we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recovery at december and the amount recorded for asbestos related liability and related insurance recovery were based on currently known fact however future event such the number of new claim filed each year average settlement cost and insurance coverage issue could cause the actual cost and insurance recovery to be higher or lower than the projected amount estimate also may vary in the future if strategy activity and outcome of asbestos litigation materially change federal and state law governing asbestos litigation increase or decrease the probability or amount of compensation of claimant and there are material change with respect to payment made to claimant by other defendant environmental cost we are subject to federal state and local environmental law and regulation we have identified site at which we are or may be liable for remediation cost associated with alleged contamination or for violation of environmental requirement this includes site that are the subject of action taken by the government of which are currently on the superfund national priority list certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified site consequently our ultimate environmental liability may include cost relating to activity of other party in addition to cost relating to our own activity at each site when we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned leased or otherwise used in our business we perform with assistance of our consultant environmental assessment on the property we expense the cost of the assessment incurred we accrue the cost of remediation

wa follows open site beginning balance new site closed site open site ending balance at december the environmental liability includes future cost for remediation and restoration of site well ongoing monitoring cost but excludes any anticipated recovery from third party cost estimate are based on information available for each site financial viability of other potentially responsible party and existing technology law and regulation the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible party site specific cost sharing arrangement with other potentially responsible party the degree of contamination by various waste the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the site and the speculative nature of remediation cost estimate of liability may vary over time due to change in federal state and local law governing environmental remediation current obligation are not expected to have material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation financial condition or liquidity property and depreciation our railroad operation are highly capital intensive and our large base of homogeneous network type asset turn over on continuous basis each year we develop capital program for the replacement of asset and for the acquisition or construction of asset that enable to enhance our operation or provide new service offering to customer asset purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum unit of property criterion property and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on straight line basis over their estimated service life which are measured in year except for rail in high density traffic corridor all rail line except for those subject to abandonment yard and switching track and electronic yard for which life are measured in million of gross ton per mile of track we use the group method of depreciation in which all item with similar characteristic use and expected life are grouped together in asset class and are depreciated using composite depreciation rate the group method of depreciation treat each asset class pool of resource not singular item we currently have more than depreciable asset class and we may increase or decrease the number of asset class due to change in technology asset strategy or other factor we determine the estimated service life of depreciable railroad property by mean of depreciation study we perform depreciation study at least every three year for equipment and every six year for track asset rail and other track material tie and ballast and other road property our depreciation study take into account the following factor statistical analysis of historical pattern of use and retirement of each of our asset class evaluation of any expected change in current operation and the outlook for continued use of the asset evaluation of technological advance and change to maintenance practice and expected salvage to be received upon retirement for rail in high density traffic corridor we measure estimated service life in million of gross ton per mile of track it ha been our experience that the life of rail in high density traffic corridor are closely correlated to usage the amount of weight carried over the rail the service life also vary based on rail weight rail condition new or secondhand and rail type straight or curve our depreciation study for rail in high density traffic corridor consider each of these factor in determining the estimated service life for rail in high density traffic corridor we calculate depreciation rate annually by dividing the number of gross ton mile carried over the rail the weight of loaded and empty freight car locomotive and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail by the estimated service life of the rail measured in million of gross ton per mile rail in high density traffic corridor account for approximately percent of the historical cost of rail and other track material based on the number of gross ton mile carried over our rail in high density traffic corridor during the estimated service life of the majority of this rail ranged from approximately year to approximately year for all other depreciable asset we compute depreciation based on the estimated service life of our asset determined from the analysis of our depreciation study change in the estimated service life of our asset and their related depreciation rate are implemented prospectively estimated service life of depreciable railroad property may vary over time due to change in physical use technology asset strategy and other factor that will have an impact on the retirement profile of our asset we are not aware of any specific factor that are reasonably likely to significantly change the estimated service life of our asset actual use and retirement of our asset may vary from our current estimate which would impact the amount of depreciation expense recognized in future period change in estimated useful life of our asset due to the result of our depreciation study could significantly impact future period depreciation expense and have material impact on our consolidated financial statement if the estimated useful life of all depreciable asset were increased by one year annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately million if the estimated useful life of all depreciable asset were decreased by one year annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately million our recent depreciation study have resulted in lower depreciation rate for some asset class these lower rate will partially offset the impact of projected higher depreciable asset base resulting in an increase in total depreciation expense by approximately to in versus under group depreciation the historical cost net of salvage of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized the historical cost of certain track asset is estimated using inflation index published by the bureau of labor statistic and ii the estimated useful life of the asset determined by our depreciation study the index were selected because they closely correlate with the major cost of the property comprising the applicable track asset class because of the number of estimate inherent in the depreciation and retirement process and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variable until group of property is completely retired we continually monitor the estimated service life of our asset and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rate are appropriate in addition we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by our depreciation study any deficiency or excess is amortized component of depreciation expense over the remaining service life of the applicable class of asset for retirement of depreciable railroad property that do not occur in the normal course of business gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meet each of the following three condition it is unusual ii it is material in amount and iii it varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation study during the last three fiscal year no gain or loss were recognized due to the retirement of depreciable railroad property gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of asset that are not part of our railroad operation income tax we account for income tax by recording tax payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax asset and liability for the expected future tax consequence of event that have been recognized in our financial statement or tax return these expected future tax consequence are measured based on current tax law the effect of future tax legislation are not anticipated future tax legislation such change in the corporate tax rate could have material impact on our financial condition result of operation or liquidity for example increase in future income tax rate would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately million when appropriate we record valuation allowance against deferred tax asset to reflect that these tax asset may not be realized in determining whether valuation allowance is appropriate we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax asset will not be realized based on management judgment using available evidence for purpose of estimating whether future taxable income will be sufficient to realize deferred tax asset in and there were no valuation allowance we recognize tax benefit that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authority the amount recognized is measured the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely to be realized upon settlement liability for unrecognized tax benefit is recorded for any tax benefit claimed in our tax return that do not meet these recognition and measurement standard pension and other postretirement benefit we use an actuarial analysis to measure the liability and expense associated with providing pension and medical and life insurance benefit opeb to eligible employee in order to use actuarial method to value the liability and expense we must make several assumption the critical assumption used to measure pension obligation and expense are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension asset for opeb the critical assumption are the discount rate and health care cost trend rate we evaluate our critical assumption at least annually and selected assumption are based on the following factor discount rate is based on mercer yield curve of high quality corporate bond rated aa by recognized rating agency for which the timing and amount of cash flow match our plan expected benefit payment expected return on plan asset is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return taking into consideration current and expected market condition health care cost trend rate is based on our historical rate of inflation and expected market condition the following table present the key assumption used to measure net periodic pension and opeb cost benefit for and the estimated impact on net periodic pension and opeb cost benefit relative to change in those assumption assumption pension opeb discount rate expected return on plan asset compensation increase health care cost trend rate pre current pre level in sensitivity increase in expense million pension opeb decrease in discount rate increase in compensation scale decrease in expected return on plan asset increase in health care cost trend rate the following table present the net periodic pension and opeb cost for the year ended december est million net periodic pension cost net periodic opeb cost in we will measure the service cost and interest cost component of our net periodic benefit cost by using individual spot rate matched with separate cash flow for each future year instead of single weighted average discount rate approach our net periodic pension cost is expected to decrease to approximately million in from million in our net periodic opeb expense is expected to decrease to approximately million in from million in cautionary information certain statement in this report and statement in other report or information filed or to be

material and supply material and supply are carried at the lower of average cost or market property and depreciation property and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on straight line basis over their estimated service life which are measured in year except for rail in high density traffic corridor all rail line except for those subject to abandonment yard and switching track and electronic yard for which life are measured in million of gross ton per mile of track we use the group method of depreciation in which all item with similar characteristic use and expected life are grouped together in asset class and are depreciated using composite depreciation rate the group method of depreciation treat each asset class pool of resource not singular item we determine the estimated service life of depreciable railroad asset by mean of depreciation study under the group method of depreciation no gain or loss is recognized when depreciable property is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business impairment of long lived asset we review long lived asset including identifiable intangible for impairment when event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if impairment indicator are present and the estimated future undiscounted cash flow are le than the carrying value of the long lived asset the carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value measured by the discounted cash flow revenue recognition we recognize freight revenue freight move from origin to destination the allocation of revenue between reporting period is based on the relative transit time in each reporting period with expense recognized incurred other revenue which include revenue earned by our subsidiary revenue from our commuter rail operation and accessorial revenue are recognized service is performed or contractual obligation are met customer incentive which are primarily provided for shipping specified cumulative volume or shipping to from specific location are recorded reduction to operating revenue based on actual or projected future customer shipment translation of foreign currency our portion of the asset and liability related to foreign investment are translated into dollar at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date revenue and expense are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the year unrealized gain or loss are reflected within common shareholder equity accumulated other comprehensive income or loss fair value measurement we use fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the input to valuation technique used to measure fair value into three broad level the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in it entirety fall is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in it entirety these level include level quoted market price in active market for identical asset or liability level observable market based input or unobservable input that are corroborated by market data level unobservable input that are not corroborated by market data we have applied fair value measurement to our pension plan asset and short and long term debt stock based compensation we have several stock based compensation plan under which employee and non employee director receive stock option nonvested retention share and nonvested stock unit we refer to the nonvested share and stock unit collectively retention award we have elected to issue treasury share to cover option exercise and stock unit vestings while new share are issued when retention share are granted we measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based award made to employee and director including stock option compensation expense is based on the calculated fair value of the award measured at the grant date and is expensed ratably over the service period of the award generally the vesting period the fair value of retention award is the closing stock price on the date of grant while the fair value of stock option is determined by using the black scholes option pricing model earnings per share basic earnings per share are calculated on the weighted average number of common share outstanding during each period diluted earnings per share include share issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock option and stock based award where the conversion of such instrument would be dilutive income tax we account for income tax by recording tax payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax asset and liability for the expected future tax consequence of event that have been recognized in our financial statement or tax return these expected future tax consequence are measured based on current tax law the effect of future tax legislation are not anticipated future tax legislation such change in the corporate tax rate could have material impact on our financial condition result of operation or liquidity when appropriate we record valuation allowance against deferred tax asset to reflect that these tax asset may not be realized in determining whether valuation allowance is appropriate we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax asset will not be realized based on management judgment using available evidence for purpose of estimating whether future taxable income will be sufficient to realize deferred tax asset we recognize tax benefit that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authority the amount recognized is measured the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely to be realized upon settlement liability for unrecognized tax benefit is recorded for any tax benefit claimed in our tax return that do not meet these recognition and measurement standard pension and postretirement benefit we incur certain employment related expense associated with pension and postretirement health benefit in order to measure the expense associated with these benefit we must make various assumption including discount rate used to value certain liability expected return on plan asset used to fund these expense compensation increase employee turnover rate anticipated mortality rate and expected future health care cost the assumption used by are based on our historical experience well current fact and circumstance we use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability associated with these benefit personal injury the cost of injury to employee and others on our property is charged to expense based on estimate of the ultimate cost and number of incident each year we use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability our personal injury liability is not discounted to present value legal fee and incidental cost are expensed incurred asbestos we estimate liability for asserted and unasserted asbestos related claim based on an assessment of the number and value of those claim we use statistical analysis to assist in properly measuring our potential liability our liability for asbestos related claim is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payment legal fee and incidental cost are expensed incurred environmental when environmental issue have been identified with respect to property currently or formerly owned leased or otherwise used in the conduct of our business we perform with the assistance of our consultant environmental assessment on such property we expense the cost of the assessment incurred we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such cost can be reasonably estimated we do not discount our environmental liability when the timing of the anticipated cash payment is not fixed or readily determinable legal fee and incidental cost are expensed incurred use of estimate the preparation of our consolidated financial statement in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect certain reported asset and liability and the disclosure of certain contingent asset and liability of the date of the consolidated financial statement well the reported amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period actual future result may differ from such estimate accounting pronouncement in may the fasb issued accounting standard update no asu revenue from contract with customer topic asu supersedes the revenue recognition guidance in topic revenue recognition the core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised good and service to customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in the exchange for those good or service this standard is effective for annual reporting period beginning after december and can be adopted either retrospectively or cumulative effect adjustment of the date of adoption asu is not expected to have material impact on our consolidated financial position result of operation or cash flow in april the fasb issued accounting standard update no asu interest imputation of interest subtopic asu change the presentation of debt issuance cost in the financial statement to present such cost direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than an asset amortization of debt issuance cost will be reported interest expense this standard is effective for annual reporting period beginning after december we elected to early adopt asu on december result the company reclassified debt issuance cost from other asset to debt on the consolidated statement of financial position asu did not have material impact on our consolidated financial position and had no impact on our result of operation or cash flow all prior period financial information presented herein ha been adjusted to reflect the retrospective application of this asu in november the fasb issued accounting standard update no asu balance sheet classification of deferred tax subtopic asu simplifies the presentation of deferred income tax by eliminating the requirement for company to present deferred tax liability and asset current and non current on the consolidated statement of financial position instead company will be required to classify all deferred tax asset and liability non current this guidance is effective for annual and interim period beginning after december and early adoption is permitted we elected to early adopt asu on december asu did not have material impact on our consolidated financial position and had no impact on our result of operation or cash flow all prior period financial information presented herein ha been adjusted to reflect the retrospective application of this asu in january the fasb issued accounting standard update no asu recognition and measurement of financial asset and financial liability subtopic asu provides guidance for the recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instrument this guidance is effective for annual and interim period beginning after december and early adoption is not permitted asu is not expected to have material impact on our consolidated financial position result of operation or cash flow stock split on june we completed two for one stock split effected in the form of stock dividend the stock split entitled all shareholder of record at the close of business on may to receive one additional share of our common stock par value per share for each share of common stock held on that date all reference to common share and per share amount have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split for all period presented stock option and other stock plan there are restricted share outstanding under the restricted stock plan for non employee director of union pacific corporation we no longer grant award of restricted share under this plan in april the shareholder approved the union pacific corporation director plan director plan whereby share of our common stock were reserved for issuance to our non employee director under the director plan each non employee director upon his or initial election to the board of director receives grant of retention share or retention stock unit prior to december each non employee director received annually an option to purchase at fair value number of share of our common stock not to exceed share during any calendar year determined by dividing by of the fair market value of one share of our common stock on the date of such board of director meeting with the resulting quotient rounded up or down to the nearest share in september the board of director eliminated

strategy our pension plan asset allocation at december and and target allocation for are follows percentage of plan asset target december allocation equity security to debt security to real estate to commodity to total the investment strategy for pension plan asset is to maintain broadly diversified portfolio designed to achieve our target average long term rate of return of while we believe we can achieve long term average rate of return of we can not be certain that the portfolio will perform to our expectation asset are strategically allocated among equity debt and other investment in order to achieve diversification level that reduces fluctuation in investment return asset allocation target range for equity debt and other portfolio are evaluated at least every three year with the assistance of an independent consulting firm actual asset allocation are monitored monthly and rebalancing action are executed at least quarterly if needed the pension plan investment are held in master trust the majority of pension plan asset are invested in equity security because equity portfolio have historically provided higher return than debt and other asset class over extended time horizon and are expected to do so in the future correspondingly equity investment also entail greater risk than other investment equity risk are balanced by investing significant portion of the plan asset in high quality debt security the average credit rating of the debt portfolio exceeded of december and of december the debt portfolio is also broadly diversified and invested primarily in treasury mortgage and corporate security the weighted average maturity of the debt portfolio wa year at both december and the investment of pension plan asset in security issued by upc is explicitly

tunnel signal building and other road asset property and depreciation our railroad operation are highly capital intensive and our large base of homogeneous network type asset turn over on continuous basis each year we develop capital program for the replacement of asset and for the acquisition or construction of asset that enable to enhance our operation or provide new service offering to customer asset purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum unit of property criterion property and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on straight line basis over their estimated service life which are measured in year except for rail in high density traffic corridor all rail line except for those subject to abandonment yard and switching track and electronic yard for which life are measured in million of gross ton per mile of track we use the group method of depreciation in which all item with similar characteristic use and expected life are grouped together in asset class and are depreciated using composite depreciation rate the group method of depreciation treat each asset class pool of resource not singular item we currently have more than depreciable asset class and we may increase or decrease the number of asset class due to change in technology asset strategy or other factor we determine the estimated service life of depreciable railroad asset by mean of depreciation study we perform depreciation study at least every three year for equipment and every six year for track asset rail and other track material tie and ballast and other road property our depreciation study take into account the following factor statistical analysis of historical pattern of use and retirement of each of our asset class evaluation of any expected change in current operation and the outlook for continued use of the asset evaluation of technological advance and change to maintenance practice and expected salvage to be received upon retirement for rail in high density traffic corridor we measure estimated service life in million of gross ton per mile of track it ha been our experience that the life of rail in high density traffic corridor are closely correlated to usage the amount of weight carried over the rail the service life also vary based on rail weight rail condition new or secondhand and rail type straight or curve our depreciation study for rail in high density traffic corridor consider each of these factor in determining the estimated service life for rail in high density traffic corridor we calculate depreciation rate annually by dividing the number of gross ton mile carried over the rail the weight of loaded and empty freight car locomotive and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail by the estimated service life of the rail measured in million of gross ton per mile for all other depreciable asset we compute depreciation based on the estimated service life of our asset determined from the analysis of our depreciation study change in the estimated service life of our asset and their related depreciation rate are implemented prospectively under group depreciation the historical cost net of salvage of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized the historical cost of certain track asset is estimated using inflation index published by the bureau of labor statistic and ii the estimated useful life of the asset determined by our depreciation study the index were selected because they closely correlate with the major cost of the property comprising the applicable track asset class because of the number of estimate inherent in the depreciation and retirement process and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variable until group of property is completely retired we continually monitor the estimated service life of our asset and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rate are appropriate in addition we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by our depreciation study any deficiency or excess is amortized component of depreciation expense over the remaining service life of the applicable class of asset for retirement of depreciable railroad property that do not occur in the normal course of business gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meet each of the following three condition is unusual ii is material in amount and iii varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation study gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of asset that are not part of our railroad operation when we purchase an asset we capitalize all cost necessary to make the asset ready for it intended use however many of our asset are self constructed large portion of our capital expenditure is for replacement of existing track asset and other road property which is typically performed by our employee and for track line expansion and other capacity project cost that are directly attributable to capital project including overhead cost are capitalized direct cost that are capitalized part of self constructed asset include material labor and work equipment indirect cost are capitalized if they clearly relate to the construction of the asset general and administrative expenditure are expensed incurred normal repair and maintenance are also expensed incurred while cost incurred that extend the useful life of an asset improve the safety of our operation or improve operating efficiency are capitalized these cost are allocated using appropriate statistical base total expense for repair and maintenance incurred wa billion for billion for and billion for asset held under capital lease are recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payment or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease amortization expense is computed using the straight line method over

which wa paid on december financial instrument strategy and risk we may use derivative financial instrument in limited instance for other than trading purpose to assist in managing our overall exposure to fluctuation in interest rate and fuel price we are not party to leveraged derivative and by policy do not use derivative financial instrument for speculative purpose derivative financial instrument qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged both at inception and throughout the hedged period we formally document the nature and relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item at inception well our risk management objective strategy for undertaking the various hedge transaction and method of assessing hedge effectiveness change in the fair market value of derivative financial instrument that do not qualify for hedge accounting are charged to earnings we may use swap collar future and or forward contract to mitigate the risk of adverse movement in interest rate and fuel price however the use of these derivative financial instrument may limit future benefit from favorable interest rate and fuel price movement market and credit risk we address market risk related to derivative financial instrument by selecting instrument with value fluctuation that highly correlate with the underlying hedged item we manage credit risk related to derivative financial instrument which is minimal by requiring high credit standard for counterparties and periodic settlement at december and we were not required to provide collateral nor had we received collateral relating to our hedging activity interest rate fair value hedge we manage our overall exposure to fluctuation in interest rate by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instrument within our debt portfolio over given period we generally manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt through the issuance of targeted amount of each debt matures or we require incremental borrowing we employ derivative primarily swap one of the tool to obtain the targeted mix in addition we also obtain flexibility in managing interest cost and the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding callable fixed rate debt security swap allow to convert debt from fixed rate to variable rate and thereby hedge the risk of change in the debt fair value attributable to the change in interest rate we account for swap fair value hedge using the short cut method therefore we do not record any ineffectiveness within our consolidated financial statement of december and we had no interest rate fair value hedge outstanding interest rate cash flow hedge we report change in the fair value of cash flow hedge in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item affect earnings of december and we had no interest rate cash flow hedge outstanding earnings impact our use of derivative financial instrument had no impact on pre tax income for the year ended december and fair value of financial instrument the fair value of our short and long term debt wa estimated using market value price model which utilizes applicable treasury rate along with current market quote on comparable debt security all of the input used to determine the fair market value of

available under the facility which is designated for general corporate purpose and support the issuance of commercial paper we did not draw on the facility during commitment fee and interest rate payable under the facility are similar to fee and rate available to comparably rated investment grade borrower the facility allows for borrowing at floating rate based on london interbank offered rate plus spread depending upon credit rating for our senior unsecured debt the facility matures in may under five year term and requires upc to maintain debt to net worth coverage ratio the definition of debt used for purpose of calculating the debt to net worth coverage ratio includes among other thing certain credit arrangement capital lease guarantee and unfunded and vested pension benefit under title iv of erisa at december the debt to net worth coverage ratio allowed to carry up to billion of debt defined in the facility and we had billion of debt defined in the facility outstanding at that date under our current capital plan we expect to continue to satisfy the debt to net worth coverage ratio however many factor beyond our reasonable control could affect our ability to comply with this provision in the future the facility doe not include any other financial restriction credit rating trigger other than rating dependent pricing or any other provision that could require to post

principally involving railroad equipment and facility and have no other activity asset or liability outside of the lease transaction within these lease arrangement we have the right to purchase some or all of the asset at fixed price depending on market condition fixed price purchase option available in the lease could potentially provide benefit to however these benefit are not expected to be significant we maintain and operate the asset based on contractual obligation within the lease arrangement which set specific guideline consistent within the railroad industry such we have no control over activity that could materially impact the fair value of the leased asset we do not hold the power to direct the activity of the vies and therefore do not control the ongoing activity that have significant impact on the economic performance of the vies additionally we do not have the obligation to absorb loss of the vies or the right to receive benefit of the vies that could potentially be significant to the vies we are not considered to be the primary beneficiary and do not consolidate these vies because our action and decision do not have the most significant effect on the vie

liability act fela governs compensation for work related accident under fela damage are assessed based on finding of fault through litigation or out of court settlement we offer comprehensive variety of service and rehabilitation program for employee who are injured at work our personal injury liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payment approximately of the recorded liability is related to asserted claim and approximately is related to unasserted claim at december because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claim it is reasonably possible that future cost to settle these claim may range from approximately million to million we record an accrual at the low end of the range no amount of

employee and other party allege exposure to asbestos we ass our potential liability using statistical analysis of resolution cost for asbestos related claim this liability is updated annually and excludes future defense and processing cost the liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claim wa based on the following assumption the ratio of future claim by alleged disease would be consistent with historical average adjusted for inflation the number of claim filed against will decline each year the average settlement value for asserted and unasserted claim will be equivalent to historical average the percentage of claim dismissed in the future will be equivalent to historical average our liability for asbestos related claim is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payment approximately of the recorded liability related to asserted claim and approximately related to unasserted claim at december because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of asbestos related claim it is reasonably possible that future cost to settle these claim may range from approximately million to million we record an accrual at the low end of the range no amount of loss within the range is more probable than any other our asbestos related liability activity wa follows million beginning balance accrual credit payment ending balance at december current portion ending balance at december in conjunction with the liability update performed in we also reassessed our estimated insurance recovery we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recovery at december and the amount recorded for asbestos related liability and related insurance recovery were based on currently known fact however future event such the number of new claim filed each year average settlement cost and insurance coverage issue could cause the actual cost and insurance recovery to be higher or lower than the projected amount estimate also may vary in the future if strategy activity and outcome of asbestos litigation materially change federal and state law governing asbestos litigation increase or decrease the probability or amount of compensation of claimant and there are material change with respect to payment made to claimant by other defendant environmental cost we are subject to federal state and local environmental law and regulation we have identified site at which we are or may be liable for remediation cost associated with alleged contamination or for violation of environmental requirement this includes site that are the subject of action taken by the government of which are currently on the superfund national priority list certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified site consequently our ultimate environmental liability may include cost relating to activity of other party in addition to cost relating to our own activity at each site when we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned leased or otherwise used in our business we perform with assistance of our consultant environmental assessment on the property we expense the cost of the assessment incurred we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such cost can be reasonably estimated our environmental liability is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payment our environmental liability activity wa follows million beginning balance accrual payment ending balance at december current portion ending balance at december the environmental liability includes future cost for remediation and restoration of site well ongoing monitoring cost but excludes any anticipated recovery from third party cost estimate are based on information available for each site financial viability of other potentially responsible party and existing technology law and regulation the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible party site specific cost sharing arrangement with other potentially responsible party the degree of contamination by various waste the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the site and the speculative nature of remediation cost estimate of liability may vary over time due to change in federal state and local law governing environmental remediation current obligation are not expected to have material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation financial condition or liquidity insurance the company ha consolidated wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary the captive that provides insurance coverage for certain risk including fela claim and property coverage which are subject to reinsurance the captive entered into annual reinsurance treaty agreement that insure worker compensation general liability auto liability and fela risk the captive cedes

participant non performance is material at this time in the event the company leaf the reinsurance program the company is not relieved of it primary obligation to the policyholder for activity prior

financial condition result of operation or liquidity indemnity we are contingently obligated under variety of indemnification arrangement although in some case the extent of our potential liability is limited depending on the nature of the transaction and the agreement due to uncertainty to whether claim will be made or how they will be resolved we can not reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangement we do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payment under these indemnity provision gain contingency uprr and santa fe pacific pipeline sfpp subsidiary of kinder morgan energy partner currently are engaged in proceeding to resolve
