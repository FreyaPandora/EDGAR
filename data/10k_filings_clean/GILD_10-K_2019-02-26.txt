for these product an application for patent term extension wa filed in the united state that if granted would extend the expiration date to application for spcs were filed in the european union that if granted would extend the expiration date to patent protection and certain challengespatents and other proprietary right are important to our business if we have properly drafted and enforceable patent it can be more difficult for our competitor to use our technology to create competitive product and more difficult for our competitor to obtain patent that prevents from using technology we create part of our business strategy we actively seek patent protection in the united state and internationally and file additional patent application appropriate to cover improvement in our compound product and technology patent covering certain of the active pharmaceutical ingredient api of most of our hiv product well yescarta letairis and ranexa are held by third party we acquired exclusive right to these patent in the agreement we have with these party we do not own patent covering ranolazine the active ingredient of ranexa instead when it wa discovered that only sustained release formulation of ranolazine would achieve therapeutic plasma level we obtained patent on those formulation and the characteristic plasma level they achieve we may obtain patent for certain product many year marketing approval is obtained because patent have limited life that may begin to run prior to the commercial sale of the related product the commercial value of the patent may be limited however we may be able to apply for patent term extension or supplementary protection certificate in country for extension for the patent or supplementary protection certificate on many of our product have been granted in the united state and in number of european country compensating in part for delay in obtaining marketing approval similar patent term extension may be available for other product we are developing but we can not be certain we will obtain in some country it is also important that we do not infringe the valid patent of third party if we infringe the valid patent of third party our reputation may be harmed and we may be required to pay significant monetary damage we may be prevented from commercializing product or we may be required to obtain license from these third party we may not be able to obtain alternative technology or any required license on reasonable term or at all if we fail to obtain these license or alternative technology we may be unable to develop or commercialize some or all of our product for example we are aware of patent and patent application owned by other party that such party may claim to cover the use of sofosbuvir axicabtagene ciloleucel and bictegravir because patent application are confidential for period of time patent is issued we may not know if our competitor have filed patent application for technology covered by our pending application or if we were the first to invent or first to file an application directed toward the technology that is the subject of our patent application competitor may have filed patent application or received patent and may obtain additional patent and proprietary right that block or compete with our product in addition if competitor file patent application covering our technology we may have to participate in interference derivation proceeding or litigation to determine the right to patent litigation and interference derivation proceeding are unpredictable and expensive such that even if we are ultimately successful our result of operation may be adversely affected by such event patent relating to pharmaceutical biopharmaceutical and biotechnology product compound and process such those that cover our existing compound product and process and those that we will likely file in the future do not always provide complete or adequate protection future litigation or other proceeding regarding the enforcement or validity of our existing patent or any future patent could result in the invalidation of our patent or substantially reduce their protection from time to time certain individual or entity may challenge our patent our pending patent application and the patent application filed by our collaborative partner may not result in the issuance of any patent or may result in patent that do not provide adequate protection result we may not be able to prevent third party from developing compound or product that are closely related to those which we have developed or are developing in addition certain country do not provide effective enforcement of our patent and third party manufacturer may be able to sell generic version of our product in those country for description of our significant pending legal proceeding see note commitment and contingency legal proceeding of the note to consolidated financial statement included in item of our annual report on form trade secretswe also rely on unpatented trade secret and improvement unpatented internal know and technological innovation for example great deal of our liposomal manufacturing expertise which is key component of our liposomal technology is not covered by patent but is instead protected trade secret we protect these right mainly through confidentiality agreement with our corporate partner employee consultant and vendor these agreement provide that all confidential information developed or made known to an individual during the course of their relationship with will be kept confidential and will not be used or disclosed to third party except in specified circumstance in the case of employee the agreement provide that all invention made by an individual employed by will be our exclusive property we can not be certain that these party will comply with these confidentiality agreement that we have adequate remedy for any breach or that our trade secret will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitor under some of our agreement invention become jointly owned by and our corporate partner and in other case become the exclusive property of one party in certain circumstance it can be difficult to determine who owns particular invention and dispute could arise regarding those invention if our trade secret or confidential information become known or independently discovered by competitor or if we enter into dispute ownership of invention our business and result of operation could be adversely affected manufacturing and raw materialsour product are manufactured either at our own facility or by third party contract manufacturer we depend on third party to perform manufacturing activity for the majority of our api and drug product for most of our product including our hiv and hcv product we use multiple third party contract manufacturer that we have primary and back supplier and manufacturing site for letairis we are the exclusive manufacturer of the ambrisentan api but we have another qualified supplier to make this api for yescarta we have established clinical and commercial manufacturing facility for the cell processing activity for our future product we continue to develop additional manufacturing capability and establish additional third party supplier to manufacture sufficient quantity of our product candidate to undertake clinical trial and to manufacture sufficient quantity of any product that is approved for commercial sale manufacturing facilitieswe own or lease manufacturing facility in foster city san dimas la verne oceanside and el segundo california dublin and cork ireland and edmonton alberta canada where we manufacture and distribute certain product and api for clinical and or commercial us foster city california we conduct process chemistry research and development activity manufacture api for our clinical trial and oversee our third party contract manufacturer san dimas and la verne california we manufacture ambisome in san dimas package and label the majority of our commercial product and distribute our product to the america and pacific rim oceanside california we utilize the facility for clinical manufacture and process development of our biologics candidate el segundo california we utilize the facility for clinical and commercial manufacture and processing of yescarta cork and dublin ireland we utilize the cork facility for commercial manufacture packaging and labeling of our antiviral product we also perform quality control testing labeling packaging and final release of many of our product for distribution to the european union and other international market the dublin facility is also responsible for distribution activity of our product edmonton alberta canada we conduct process chemistry research and scale up activity of our clinical development candidate manufacture api for both investigational and commercial product and conduct chemical development activity to improve existing commercial manufacturing process third party manufacturerswe believe the technology we use to manufacture our product is proprietary for product manufactured by our third party contract manufacturer we have disclosed all necessary aspect of this technology to enable them to manufacture the product for we have agreement with these third party manufacturer that are intended to restrict them from using or revealing this technology but we can not be certain that these third party manufacturer will comply with these restriction in addition these third party manufacturer could develop their own technology related to the work they perform for that we may need to manufacture our product we could be required to enter into additional agreement with these third party manufacturer if we want to use that technology ourselves or allow another manufacturer to use that technology the third party manufacturer could refuse to allow to use their technology or could demand term to use their technology that are not acceptable to for more information about our third party manufacturer see item risk factor manufacturing problem including at our third party manufacturer and corporate partner could cause inventory shortage and delay product shipment and regulatory approval which may adversely affect our result of operation regulation of manufacturing processthe manufacturing process for pharmaceutical product is highly regulated and regulator may shut manufacturing facility that they believe do not comply with regulation we our third party manufacturer and our corporate partner are subject to current good manufacturing practice which are extensive regulation governing manufacturing process stability testing record keeping and quality standard defined by fda and the european medicine agency ema similar regulation are in effect in other jurisdiction our manufacturing operation are subject to routine inspection by regulatory agency for yescarta we are required by fda to comply with the risk evaluation and mitigation strategy program which includes educating and certifying medical personnel regarding the therapy procedure and the potential side effect profile of our therapy such the potential adverse side effect related to cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxicity additionally we are required to maintain complex chain of identity and custody with respect to patient material such material move to the manufacturing facility through the manufacturing process and back to the patient access to raw material we need access to certain raw material to conduct our clinical trial and manufacture our product these raw material are generally available from multiple source purchased worldwide and normally available in quantity adequate to meet the need of our business we attempt to manage the risk associated with our supply chain by inventory management relationship management and evaluation of alternative source when feasible for more information see item risk factor we may not be able to obtain material or supply necessary to conduct clinical trial or to manufacture and sell our product which would limit our ability to generate revenue seasonality of operation and backlogour worldwide product sale do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality in end user demand in the united state fluctuation in wholesaler inventory level have impacted our product sale we have observed that strong wholesaler and sub purchase of our product in the fourth quarter have resulted in inventory draw down by wholesaler and sub wholesaler in the subsequent first quarter several other factor including government budget annual grant cycle for federal and state fund and other buying pattern have impacted the product sale recorded in particular quarter for more information see item risk factor our inability to accurately predict demand for our product uptake of new product or fluctuation in customer inventory make it difficult for to accurately forecast sale and may cause our forecasted revenue and earnings to fluctuate which could adversely affect our financial result and our stock price for the most part we operate in market characterized by short lead time and the absence of significant backlog we do not believe that backlog information is material to our business whole government regulationour operation and activity are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government authority in the united state the european union and other country including law and regulation governing the testing manufacture safety efficacy labeling storage record keeping approval advertising and promotion of our product result of these regulation product development and product approval process are very expensive and time consuming the regulatory requirement applicable to drug development and approval are subject to change any legal and regulatory change may impact our operation in the future country regulatory agency such fda in the united state and ema european commission for the european union must approve drug before it can be sold in the respective country or country the general process for drug approval in the united state is summarized many other country including country in the european union have similar regulatory structure preclinical testingbefore we can test drug candidate in human we must study the drug in laboratory experiment and in animal to generate data to support the drug candidate potential benefit and safety we submit this data to fda in an investigational new drug ind application seeking it approval to test the compound in human clinical trialsif fda accepts the ind the drug candidate can be studied in human clinical trial to determine if the drug candidate is safe and effective these clinical trial involve three separate phase that often overlap can take many year and are very expensive these three phase which are subject to considerable regulation are follows phase the drug candidate is given to small number of healthy human control subject or patient suffering from the indicated disease to test for safety dose tolerance pharmacokinetics metabolism distribution and excretion phase the drug candidate is given to limited patient population to determine the effect of the drug candidate in treating the disease the best dose of the drug candidate and the possible side effect and safety risk of the drug candidate it is not uncommon for drug candidate that appears promising in phase clinical trial to fail in the more rigorous and extensive phase clinical trial phase if drug candidate appears to be effective and safe in phase clinical trial phase clinical trial are commenced to confirm those result phase clinical trial are conducted over longer term involve significantly larger population are conducted at numerous site in different geographic region and are carefully designed to provide reliable and conclusive data regarding the safety and benefit of drug candidate it is not uncommon for drug candidate that appears promising in phase clinical trial to fail in the more rigorous and extensive phase clinical trial fda approval processwhen we believe that the data from our clinical trial show an acceptable benefit risk profile we submit the appropriate filing usually in the form of new drug application nda or supplemental nda with fda seeking approval to sell the drug candidate for particular use fda may hold public hearing where an independent advisory committee of expert advisor asks additional question and make recommendation regarding the drug candidate this committee make recommendation to fda that is not binding but is generally followed by fda if fda agrees that the compound ha met the required level of safety and efficacy for particular use it will allow to sell the drug candidate in the united state for that use it is not unusual however for fda to reject an application because it belief that the drug candidate is not safe enough or efficacious enough or because it not believe that the data submitted is reliable or conclusive at any point in this process the development of drug candidate can be stopped for number of reason including safety concern and lack of treatment benefit we can not be certain that any clinical trial that we are currently conducting or any that we conduct in the future will be completed successfully or within any specified time period we may choose or fda may require to delay or suspend our clinical trial at any time if it appears that the patient are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or if the drug candidate doe not appear to have sufficient treatment benefit may also require phase non registrational study to explore scientific question to further characterize safety and efficacy during commercial use of our drug fda may also require to provide additional data or information improve our manufacturing process procedure or facility or may require extensive surveillance to monitor the safety or benefit of our product candidate if it determines that our filing doe not contain adequate evidence of the safety and benefit of the drug in addition even if fda approves drug it could limit the us of the drug fda can withdraw approval if it doe not believe that we are complying with regulatory standard or if problem are uncovered or occur after approval in addition to obtaining fda approval for each drug we obtain fda approval of the manufacturing facility for any drug we sell including those of company who manufacture our drug for all of these facility are subject to periodic inspection by fda fda must also approve foreign establishment that manufacture product to be sold in the united state and these facility are subject to periodic regulatory inspection our manufacturing facility located in california also must be licensed by the state of california in compliance with local regulatory requirement our manufacturing facility in canada and ireland also must obtain local license and permit in compliance with local regulatory requirement drug that treat serious or life threatening disease and condition that are not adequately addressed by existing drug and for which the development program is designed to address the unmet medical need may be designated fast track candidate by fda and may be eligible for priority review drug for the treatment of hiv infection that are designated for use under the president emergency plan for aid relief may also qualify for an expedited review european union approval processdrugs are also subject to extensive regulation outside of the united state in the european union is centralized approval procedure that authorizes marketing of product in all country of the european union if this centralized approval procedure is not used approval in one country of the european union can be used to obtain approval in another country of the european union under one of two simplified application process the mutual recognition procedure or the decentralized procedure both of which rely on the principle of mutual recognition after receiving regulatory approval through any of the european registration procedure separate pricing and reimbursement approval are also required in most country the european union also ha requirement for approval of manufacturing facility for all product that are approved for sale by the european regulatory authority pricing and reimbursementsuccessful commercialization of our product depends in part on the availability of governmental and third party payer reimbursement for the cost of such product and related treatment in the market where we sell our product government health authority private health insurer and other organization generally provide reimbursement in the united state the european union and other significant or potentially significant market for our product and product candidate government authority and third party payer are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical product and service significant portion of our sale of the majority of our product are subject to substantial discount from the list price result the price increase we implement from time to time on certain product may have limited effect on our product sale in certain market in addition standard reimbursement structure may not adequately reimburse for innovative therapy our product mature private insurer and government payer often reduce the amount they will reimburse patient which increase pressure on to reduce price further new branded or generic product are introduced into major market our ability to maintain pricing and market share may be affected for more information see item risk factor our existing product are subject to reimbursement from government agency and other third party pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement pressure may reduce profitability and our inability to accurately predict demand for our product uptake of new product or fluctuation in customer inventory make it difficult for to accurately forecast sale and may cause our forecasted revenue and earnings to fluctuate which could adversely affect our financial result and our stock price patient assistance programsrecently there ha been enhanced scrutiny of company sponsored patient assistance program including insurance premium and co pay assistance program and donation to third party charity that provide such assistance there ha also been enhanced scrutiny by government on reimbursement support offering clinical education program and promotional speaker program if we or our agent vendor or donation recipient are deemed to have failed to comply with law regulation or government guidance in any of these area we could be subject to criminal and civil sanction any similar violation by our competitor could also negatively impact our industry reputation and increase scrutiny over our business and our product care fraud and abuse law anti bribery lawswe are subject to various federal and state law pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including anti kickback law and false claim law anti kickback law make it illegal for prescription drug manufacturer to solicit offer receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of business including the purchase or prescription of particular drug due to the breadth of the statutory provision and the increasing attention being given to them by law enforcement authority it is possible that certain of our practice may be challenged under anti kickback or similar law false claim law generally prohibit anyone from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claim for payment by federal and certain state payer including medicare and medicaid or knowingly making using or causing to be made or used false record or statement material to false or fraudulent claim our sale marketing patient support and medical activity may be subject to scrutiny under these law in addition the foreign corrupt practice act and similar worldwide anti bribery law generally prohibit company and their intermediary from making improper payment for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policy mandate compliance with these anti bribery law we operate in part of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree in certain circumstance strict compliance with anti bribery law may conflict with local custom and practice or may require to interact with doctor and hospital some of which may be state controlled in manner that is different than local custom despite our training and compliance program our internal control policy and procedure may not protect from reckless or criminal act committed by our employee or agent violation of fraud and abuse law or anti bribery law may be punishable by criminal and or civil sanction including fine and civil monetary penalty well the possibility of exclusion from federal health care program including medicare and medicaid violation can also lead to the imposition of corporate integrity agreement or similar government oversight program healthcare reformthe federal and state government continue to propose and pas legislation designed to regulate the healthcare industry including legislation that seek to indirectly or directly regulate pharmaceutical drug pricing for more information see item risk factor our result of operation may be adversely affected by current and potential future healthcare legislative and regulatory action and law and regulation applicable to the health care industry could impose new obligation on require to change our business practice and restrict our operation in the future employeesas of january we approximately employee we believe we have good relation with our employee environmentwe are subject to number of law and regulation that require compliance with federal state and local regulation for the protection of the environment the regulatory landscape continues to evolve and we anticipate additional regulation in the near future law and regulation are implemented and under consideration to mitigate the effect of climate change mainly caused by greenhouse gas emission our business is not energy intensive therefore we do not anticipate being subject to cap and trade system or other mitigation measure that would materially impact our capital expenditure operation or competitive position other informationwe are subject to the information requirement of the exchange act therefore we file periodic report proxy and information statement and other information with the sec the sec maintains website http www sec gov that contains report proxy and information statement and other information regarding issuer that file electronically with the sec the mailing address of our headquarters is lakeside drive foster city california and our telephone number at that location is our website is www gilead com through link on the investor page of our website under sec filing section we make available the following filing free of charge soon reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the sec our annual report on form quarterly report on form current report on form and any amendment to those report filed or furnished pursuant to section or of the exchange act transaction with iranwe not engage in any transaction within iran during that would require disclosure in this annual report on form risk factorsin evaluating our business you should carefully consider the following risk in addition to the other information in this annual report on form manifestation of any of the following risk could materially and adversely affect our business result of operation and financial condition we note these factor for investor permitted by the private security litigation reform act of it is not possible to predict or identify all such factor and therefore you should not consider the following risk to be complete statement of all the potential risk or uncertainty that we face substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sale of product to treat hiv and hcv if we are unable to increase hiv sale or if hcv sale decrease more than anticipated then our result of operation may be adversely affected we receive substantial portion of our revenue from sale of our product for the treatment of hiv infection during the year ended december sale of our hiv product accounted for approximately of our total product sale and we expect our hiv product to account for higher percentage of our total product sale in than in most of our hiv product contain tenofovir alafenamide taf tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tdf and or emtricitabine which belong to the nucleoside class of antiviral therapeutic if the treatment paradigm for hiv change causing nucleoside based therapeutic to fall of favor or if we are unable to maintain or increase our hiv product sale our result of operation would likely suffer and we would likely need to scale back our operation including our future drug development and spending on research and development effort during the year ended december sale of our product for the treatment of chronic hepatitis virus hcv infection accounted for approximately of our total product sale our hcv revenue have declined and we expect further decline in product sale in compared to in major market the driver of our hcv product revenue are patient start net pricing market share and treatment duration with treatment duration stabilizing and pricing largely stabilizing we expect to continue to compete for market share across market segment and geography we anticipate patient start to continue to steadily decline and be more predictable any unexpected and adverse change to these driver including any larger than anticipated shift may adversely impact our hcv product revenue in addition future sale of our hiv and hcv product depend in part on the extent of reimbursement of our product by private and public payer we may continue to experience global pricing pressure that could result in larger discount or rebate on our product or delayed reimbursement which negatively impact our product sale and result of operation also private and public payer can choose to exclude our product from their formulary coverage list or limit the type of patient for whom coverage will be provided which would negatively impact the demand for and revenue of our product any change in the formulary coverage reimbursement level or discount or rebate offered on our product to payer may impact our anticipated revenue if we are unable to achieve our forecasted hiv and hcv sale our stock price could be adversely impacted we may be unable to sustain or increase sale of our hiv or hcv product for any number of reason including but not limited to the reason discussed above and the following our product are used over longer period of time in many patient and in combination with other product and additional study are conducted new issue with respect to safety resistance and interaction with other drug may arise which could cause to provide additional warning or contraindication on our label narrow our approved indication or halt sale of product each of which could reduce our revenue our product mature private insurer and government payer often reduce the amount they will reimburse patient for these product which increase pressure on to reduce price if physician do not see the benefit of our hiv or hcv product the sale of our hiv or hcv product will be limited new branded or generic product are introduced into major market our ability to maintain pricing and market share may be affected if we fail to commercialize new product or expand the indication for existing product our prospect for future revenue and our result of operation may be adversely affected if we do not introduce new product or increase sale of our existing product we will not be able to increase or maintain our total revenue continue to expand our effort and our result of operation may be adversely affected drug development is inherently risky and many product candidate fail during the drug development process we may decide to terminate product development after expending significant resource and effort for example we recently announced that our kite an anti cell maturation antigen anti bcma being evaluated for the treatment of multiple myeloma will not be moving forward we also recently announced that stellar phase study evaluating the safety and efficacy of selonsertib in patient with compensated cirrhosis due to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis nash did not meet the pre specified week primary endpoint in addition if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for product candidate our future revenue growth and result of operation may be adversely impacted any future marketing application we file may not be approved by the regulatory authority on timely basis or at all even if marketing approval is granted there may be significant limitation on their use our inability to accurately predict demand for our product uptake of new product or fluctuation in customer inventory make it difficult for to accurately forecast sale and may cause our forecasted revenue and earnings to fluctuate which could adversely affect our financial result and stock price we may be unable to accurately predict demand for our product including the uptake of new product demand depends on number of factor for example the non retail sector in the united state which includes government institution including state aid drug assistance program adaps the department of veteran affair correctional facility and large health maintenance organization tends to be even le consistent in term of buying pattern and often cause quarter over quarter fluctuation that do not necessarily mirror patient demand for our product federal and state budget pressure well the annual grant cycle for federal and state fund may cause purchasing pattern to not reflect patient demand of our product for example in the first quarter of and certain prior year we observed large non retail purchase of our hiv product by number of state adaps that exceeded patient demand we believe such purchase were driven by the grant cycle for federal adap fund we expect to continue to experience fluctuation in the purchasing pattern of our non retail customer which may result in fluctuation in our product sale revenue and earnings in the future in light of the budget crisis faced by many european country we have observed variation in purchasing pattern induced by cost containment measure in europe we believe these measure have caused some government agency and other purchaser to reduce inventory of our product in the distribution channel which ha decreased our revenue and caused fluctuation in our product sale and earnings we may continue to see this trend in the future we sell and distribute most of our product in the united state exclusively through the wholesale channel during the year ended december approximately of our product sale in the united state were to three wholesaler amerisourcebergen corp cardinal health inc and mckesson corp the wholesaler with whom we have entered into inventory management agreement make estimate to determine end user demand and may not be completely effective in matching their inventory level to actual end user demand result change in inventory level held by those wholesaler can cause our operating result to fluctuate unexpectedly if our sale to these wholesaler do not match end user demand in addition inventory is held at retail pharmacy and other non wholesaler location with whom we have no inventory management agreement and no control over buying pattern adverse change in economic condition increased competition or other factor may cause retail pharmacy to reduce their inventory of our product which would reduce their order from wholesaler and consequently the wholesaler order from even if end user demand ha not changed for example during the fourth quarter of strong wholesaler and sub wholesaler purchase of our product resulted in inventory draw down by wholesaler and sub wholesaler in the first quarter of inventory in the distribution channel fluctuates from quarter to quarter we may continue to see fluctuation in our earnings and mismatch between prescription demand for our product and our revenue in addition we estimate the rebate we will be required to pay in connection with sale during particular quarter based on claim data from prior quarter in the united state actual rebate claim are typically made by payer one to three quarter in arrears actual claim may vary significantly from our estimate which can cause an adjustment to our product revenue to the extent our actual or anticipated product revenue exceed or fall short of investor expectation our stock price could be adversely impacted yescarta chimeric antigen receptor car cell therapy represents novel approach to cancer treatment that creates significant challenge for which may impact our ability to increase sale of yescarta yescarta car cell therapy involves harvesting cell from the patient blood ii engineering cell to express cancer specific receptor iii increasing the number of engineered cell and iv infusing the functional cancer specific cell back into the patient advancing this novel and personalized therapy creates significant challenge including educating and certifying medical personnel regarding the procedure and the potential side effect profile of our therapy such the potential adverse side effect related to cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxicity in compliance with the risk evaluation and mitigation strategy rem program required by fda for yescarta using medicine to manage adverse side effect of our therapy such tocilizumab and corticosteroid which may not be available in sufficient quantity may not adequately control the side effect and or may have detrimental impact on the efficacy of the treatment developing robust and reliable process while limiting contamination risk for engineering patient cell ex vivo and infusing the engineered cell back into the patient and conditioning patient with chemotherapy in advance of administering our therapy which may increase the risk of adverse side effect use of engineered cell potential cancer treatment is recent development and may not be broadly accepted by physician patient hospital cancer treatment center payer and others in the medical community we may not be able to establish or demonstrate to the medical community or commercial or governmental payer the safety and efficacy of yescarta and the potential advantage compared to existing and future therapeutic if we fail to overcome these significant challenge our sale of yescarta result of operation and stock price could be adversely affected we face significant competition we face significant competition from global pharmaceutical and biotechnology company specialized pharmaceutical firm and generic drug manufacturer our product compete with other available product based primarily on efficacy safety tolerability acceptance by doctor ease of patient compliance ease of use price insurance and other reimbursement coverage distribution and marketing our taf containing hiv product compete primarily with product from viiv healthcare company viiv we also face competition from generic hiv product generic version of efavirenz component of atripla are available in the united state canada and europe we have observed some pricing pressure related to the efavirenz component of our atripla sale tdf one of the active pharmaceutical ingredient in truvada atripla complera eviplera and stribild face generic competition in the european union the united state and certain other country in addition because emtricitabine the other active pharmaceutical ingredient of truvada face generic competition in the european union truvada also face generic competition in the european union and certain other country outside of the united state our hcv product compete primarily with product marketed by abbvie and merck our hbv product face competition from existing therapy for treating patient with hbv well generic version of tdf our hbv product also compete with product marketed by bristol myers squibb company and novartis pharmaceutical corporation novartis yescarta competes with car cell therapy marketed by novartis and is expected to compete with product from other company developing advanced cell therapy letairis competes with product marketed by actelion pharmaceutical inc united therapeutic corporation and pfizer inc because the patent for ambrisentan the active pharmaceutical ingredient in letairis expired in july letairis is expected to face competition from manufacturer of generic version of letairis in the united state ranexa competes predominantly with generic compound from three distinct class of drug for the treatment of chronic angina in the united state including generic and or branded beta blocker calcium channel blocker and long acting nitrate ranexa is expected to face competition from manufacturer of generic version of ranexa in the united state starting in the first quarter of in addition number of company are pursuing the development of technology which are competitive with our existing product or research program these competing company include specialized pharmaceutical firm and large pharmaceutical company acting either independently or together with other pharmaceutical company furthermore academic institution government agency and other public and private organization conducting research may seek patent protection and may establish collaborative arrangement for competitive product or program if any of these competitor gain market share result of new technology commercialization strategy or otherwise it could adversely affect our result of operation and stock price our result of operation may be adversely affected by current and potential future healthcare legislative and regulatory action legislative and regulatory action affecting government prescription drug procurement and reimbursement program occur relatively frequently in the united state the affordable care act the aca wa enacted in to expand healthcare coverage since then numerous effort have been made to repeal amend or administratively limit the aca in whole or in part for example the tax cut and job act signed into law by president trump in repealed the individual health insurance mandate which is considered key component of the aca in december texas federal district court struck down the aca on the ground that the individual health insurance mandate is unconstitutional although this ruling ha been stayed pending appeal the ongoing challenge to the aca have resulted in uncertainty regarding it future viability and destabilization of the health insurance market the resulting impact on our business is uncertain and could be material effort to control prescription drug price could also have material adverse effect on our business for example in president trump and the secretary of the department of health and human service hhs released the american patient first blueprint and have begun implementing certain portion the initiative includes proposal to increase generic drug and biosimilar competition enable the medicare program to negotiate drug price more directly and improve transparency regarding drug price and way to lower consumer out of pocket cost the trump administration also proposed to establish an international pricing index that would be used benchmark to determine the cost of drug under medicare part in addition many state proposed or enacted legislation that seek to indirectly or directly regulate pharmaceutical drug pricing such by requiring biopharmaceutical manufacturer to publicly report proprietary pricing information or to place maximum price ceiling on pharmaceutical product purchased by state agency for example in california governor signed prescription drug price transparency state bill into law requiring prescription drug manufacturer to provide advance notice and explanation for price increase of certain drug that exceed specified threshold similar bill have been introduced at the federal level such initiative and legislation may cause added pricing pressure on our product change to the medicaid program at the federal or state level could also have material adverse effect on our business proposal that could impact coverage and reimbursement of our product including giving state more flexibility to manage drug covered under the medicaid program and permitting the re importation of prescription medication from canada or other country could have material adverse effect by limiting our product use and coverage furthermore state medicaid program could request additional supplemental rebate on our product result of an increase in the federal base medicaid rebate to the extent that private insurer or managed care program follow medicaid coverage and payment development they could use the enactment of these increased rebate to exert pricing pressure on our product and the adverse effect may be magnified by their adoption of lower payment schedule other proposed regulatory action affecting manufacturer could have material adverse effect on our business for example in december hhs proposed rule that would modify the medicare part protected class policy to provide part plan sponsor broader authority to impose step therapy prior authorization and other utilization management control on product in the part protected class including our hiv product in january hhs also proposed rule that would remove regulatory protection under the discount safe harbor to the federal anti kickback statute for manufacturer rebate paid to part plan sponsor medicaid managed care organization and pharmacy benefit manager under contract with them and would create new safe harbor for arrangement with these entity it is difficult to predict the impact if any of any such proposed legislative and regulatory action or resulting state action on the use and reimbursement of our product in the united state but our result of operation may be adversely affected our existing product are subject to reimbursement from government agency and other third party pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement pressure may reduce profitability successful commercialization of our product depends in part on the availability of governmental and third party payer reimbursement for the cost of such product and related treatment in the market where we sell our product government health authority private health insurer and other organization generally provide reimbursement in the united state the european union and other significant or potentially significant market for our product and product candidate government authority and third party payer are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical product and service substantial portion of sale of the majority of our product is subject to significant discount from list price in addition standard reimbursement structure may not adequately reimburse for innovative therapy for example effective october the center for medicare and medicaid service cm established inpatient reimbursement for patient receiving yescarta the reimbursement includes payment for severity adjusted diagnosis related group drg new technology add on payment ntap for yescarta that at most will cover one half the cost of yescarta and may cover le than that and in some case an outlier payment taken together the total payment may not be sufficient to reimburse hospital for their cost of care for patient receiving yescarta this payment methodology is likely to be in effect until at least september limited payment such this could impact the willingness of some hospital to offer the therapy and of doctor to recommend the therapy and could lessen the attractiveness of our therapy to patient which could have an adverse effect on sale of yescarta and on our result of operation cm ha also proposed national coverage decision on car cell and would impose certain coverage limitation on that therapy these coverage limitation would apply to the entire medicare program and includes among other thing requirement for patient to be enrolled in clinical trial or registry in order for the hospital and physician to be paid for car cell therapy further commercial payer may follow medicare coverage policy and could impose similar limitation additionally in the european union there are barrier to reimbursement in individual country that could limit the uptake of yescarta law and regulation applicable to the health care industry could impose new obligation on require to change our business practice and restrict our operation in the future the health care industry is subject to various federal state and international law and regulation pertaining to drug reimbursement rebate price reporting health care fraud and abuse and data privacy and security in the united state these law include anti kickback and false claim law law and regulation relating to the medicare and medicaid program and other federal and state program the medicaid rebate statute individual state law relating to pricing and sale and marketing practice the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa and other federal and state law relating to the privacy and security of health information of these law or any related regulation may be punishable by criminal and or civil sanction including in some instance substantial fine civil monetary penalty exclusion from participation in federal and state health care program including medicare medicaid veteran administration health program and federal employee health benefit program action executive overseeing our business and burdensome remediation measure in addition these law and regulation are broad in scope and they are subject to change and evolving interpretation which could require to incur substantial cost associated with compliance or to alter one or more of our sale or marketing practice violation of these law or allegation of such violation could also result in negative publicity or other consequence that could harm our reputation disrupt our business or adversely affect our result of operation if any or all of these event occur our business and stock price could be materially and adversely affected recently there ha been enhanced scrutiny of company sponsored patient assistance program including insurance premium and co pay assistance program and donation to third party charity that provide such assistance there ha also been enhanced scrutiny by government on reimbursement support offering clinical education program and promotional speaker program if we or our agent vendor or donation recipient are deemed to have failed to comply with law regulation or government guidance in any of these area we could be subject to criminal or civil sanction any similar violation by our competitor could also negatively impact our industry reputation and increase scrutiny over our business and our product for description of our government investigation and related litigation see note commitment and contingency of the note to consolidated financial statement included in item of our annual report on form we have engaged in and may in the future engage in business acquisition licensing arrangement strategic collaboration or disposal of our asset which could cause to incur significant expense and could adversely affect our financial condition and result of operation we have engaged in and may in the future engage in business acquisition licensing arrangement strategic collaboration or disposal of our asset part of our business strategy we may not identify suitable transaction in the future and if we do we may not complete such transaction in timely manner on cost effective basis or at all and may not realize the expected benefit if we are successful in making an acquisition the product and technology that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resource and investment than originally anticipated we may not be able to integrate acquisition successfully into our existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liability we also conduct annual impairment testing of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset in the fourth quarter or earlier if impairment indicator exist required under generally accepted accounting principle if we fail to overcome these risk it could cause to incur significant expense and negatively affect profitability which could have an adverse effect on our result of operation we could also experience negative effect on our reported result of operation from acquisition or disposition related charge amortization of expense related to intangible and charge for impairment of long term asset approximately of our product sale occur outside the united state and currency fluctuation and hedging expense may cause our earnings to fluctuate which could adversely affect our stock price because significant percentage of our product sale are denominated in foreign currency primarily the euro we face exposure to adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rate when the dollar strengthens against these foreign currency the relative value of sale made in the respective foreign currency decrease conversely when the dollar weakens against these currency the relative value of such sale increase overall we are net receiver of foreign currency and therefore benefit from weaker dollar and are adversely affected by stronger dollar we use foreign currency exchange forward and option contract to hedge percentage of our forecasted international sale primarily those denominated in the euro we also hedge certain monetary asset and liability denominated in foreign currency which reduces but doe not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuation between the date transaction is recorded and the date cash is collected or paid foreign currency exchange net of hedge had favorable impact on our product sale of million for the year ended december compared to the period in we can not predict future fluctuation in the foreign currency exchange rate of the dollar if the dollar appreciates significantly against certain currency and our hedging program doe not sufficiently offset the effect of such appreciation our result of operation will be adversely affected and our stock price may decline additionally the expense that we recognize in relation to our hedging activity can also cause our earnings to fluctuate the level of hedging expense that we recognize in particular period is impacted by the change in interest rate spread between the foreign currency that we hedge and the dollar significant safety issue arise for our marketed product or our product candidate our reputation may be harmed and our future sale may be reduced which would adversely affect our result of operation the data supporting the marketing approval for our product and forming the basis for the safety warning in our product label were obtained in controlled clinical trial of limited duration and in some case from post approval use our product are used over longer period of time by many patient with underlying health problem taking numerous other medicine we expect to continue to find new issue such safety resistance or drug interaction issue which may require to provide additional warning or contraindication on our label or narrow our approved indication each of which could reduce the market acceptance of these product regulatory authority have been moving towards more active and transparent pharmacovigilance and are making greater amount of stand alone safety information and clinical trial data directly available to the public through website and other mean such periodic safety update report summary risk management plan summary and various adverse event data safety information without the appropriate context and expertise may be misinterpreted and lead to misperception or legal action which may potentially cause our product sale or stock price to decline further if serious safety resistance or drug interaction issue arise with our marketed product sale of these product could be limited or halted by or by regulatory authority and our result of operation would be adversely affected our operation depend on compliance with complex fda and comparable international regulation failure to obtain broad approval on timely basis or to maintain compliance could delay or halt commercialization of our product the product we develop must be approved for marketing and sale by regulatory authority and once approved are subject to extensive regulation by fda the european medicine agency ema and comparable regulatory agency in other country we are continuing clinical trial for many of our product for currently approved and additional us we anticipate that we will file for marketing approval in additional country and for additional indication and product over the next several year these product may fail to receive such marketing approval on timely basis or at all further how we manufacture and sell our product is subject to extensive regulation and review discovery of previously unknown problem with our marketed product or problem with our manufacturing safety reporting or promotional activity may result in restriction on our product including withdrawal of the product from the market if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirement including those related to promotion and manufacturing we could be subject to penalty including fine suspension of regulatory approval product recall seizure of product and criminal prosecution for example under fda rule we are often required to conduct post approval clinical study to ass known serious risk signal of serious risk or to identify an unexpected serious risk and implement rem for our product which could include medication guide patient package insert communication plan to healthcare provider or other element fda deems are necessary to assure safe use of the drug which could include imposing certain restriction on the distribution or use of product failure to comply with these or other requirement imposed by fda could result in significant civil monetary penalty and our operating result may be adversely affected we face risk in our clinical trial including the potential for unfavorable result delay in anticipated timeline and disruption which would adversely affect our prospect for future revenue growth and our result of operation we are required to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of product that we develop for each intended use through extensive preclinical study and clinical trial the result from preclinical and early clinical study do not always accurately predict result in later large scale clinical trial even successfully completed large scale clinical trial may not result in marketable product for example we recently announced that our kite an anti bcma being evaluated for the treatment of multiple myeloma will not be moving forward we also recently announced that stellar phase study evaluating the safety and efficacy of selonsertib in patient with compensated cirrhosis due to nash did not meet the pre specified week primary endpoint if any of our product candidate fails to achieve it primary endpoint in clinical trial if safety issue arise or if the result from our clinical trial are otherwise inadequate to support regulatory approval of our product candidate commercialization of that product candidate could be delayed or halted in addition we may also face challenge in clinical trial protocol design if the clinical trial for any of the product candidate in our pipeline are delayed or terminated our prospect for future revenue growth and our result of operation would be adversely impacted for example we face numerous risk and uncertainty with our product candidate including descovy for pre exposure prophylaxis prep selonsertib for the treatment of nash axicabtagene ciloleucel for the treatment of second line diffuse large cell lymphoma and filgotinib for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis crohn disease and ulcerative colitis each currently in phase clinical trial that could prevent completion of development of these product candidate these risk include our ability to enroll patient in clinical trial the possibility of unfavorable result of our clinical trial the need to modify or delay our clinical trial or to perform additional trial and the risk of failing to obtain fda and other regulatory body approval result our product candidate may never be successfully commercialized for example fda ha requested that we conduct safety study of filgotinib in men with ulcerative colitis manta study and in this manta study will likely be the rate limiting factor to filing an nda for filgotinib in the united state further we may make strategic decision to discontinue development of our product candidate if for example we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunity in our pipeline if these program and others in our pipeline can not be completed on timely basis or at all then our prospect for future revenue growth and our result of operation may be adversely impacted in addition clinical trial involving our commercial product could raise new safety issue for our existing product which could in turn adversely affect our result of operation and harm our business in addition we extensively outsource our clinical trial activity and usually perform only small portion of the start up activity in house we rely on independent third party contract research organization cro to perform most of our clinical study including document preparation site identification screening and preparation pre study visit training program management patient enrollment ongoing monitoring site management and bioanalytical analysis many important aspect of the service performed for by the cro are out of our direct control if there is any dispute or disruption in our relationship with our cro our clinical trial may be delayed moreover in our regulatory submission we rely on the quality and validity of the clinical work performed by third party cro if any of our cro process methodology or result were determined to be invalid or inadequate our own clinical data and result and related regulatory approval could be adversely affected we depend on relationship with third party for sale and marketing performance technology development logistics and commercialization of product failure to maintain these relationship poor performance by these company or dispute with these third party could negatively impact our business we rely on number of collaborative relationship with third party for our sale and marketing performance in certain territory for example we have collaboration arrangement with janssen science ireland uc for odefsey complera eviplera and symtuza in some country we rely on international distributor for sale of certain of our product some of these relationship also involve the clinical development of these product by our partner reliance on collaborative relationship pose number of risk including the risk that we are unable to control the resource our corporate partner devote to our program or product dispute may arise with respect to the ownership of right to technology developed with our corporate partner disagreement with our corporate partner could cause delay in or termination of the research development or commercialization of product candidate or result in litigation or arbitration contract with our corporate partner may fail to provide significant protection or may fail to be effectively enforced if one of these partner fails to perform our corporate partner have considerable discretion in electing whether to pursue the development of any additional product and may pursue alternative technology or product either on their own or in collaboration with our competitor our corporate partner with marketing right may choose to pursue competing technology or to devote fewer resource to the marketing of our product than they do to product of their own development and our distributor and our corporate partner may be unable to pay given these risk there is great deal of uncertainty regarding the success of our current and future collaborative effort if these effort fail our product development or commercialization of new product could be delayed or revenue from product could decline in addition we rely on third party site to collect patient white blood cell known apheresis center shipper courier and hospital for the logistical collection of patient white blood cell and ultimate delivery of yescarta to patient any disruption or difficulty incurred by any of these vendor could result in product loss and regulatory action and harm our yescarta business and our reputation to ensure that any apheresis center is prepared to ship cell to our manufacturing facility we plan to conduct quality certification of each apheresis center however apheresis center may choose not to participate in the certification process or we may be unable to complete certification in timely manner or at all which could delay or restrain our manufacturing and commercialization effort result our sale of yescarta may be limited which could harm our result of operation our success depends to significant degree on our ability to defend our patent and other intellectual property right both domestically and internationally we may not be able to obtain effective patent to protect our technology from use by competitor patent and other proprietary right are very important to our business our success depends to significant degree on our ability to obtain patent and license to patent right preserve trade secret and internal know how defend against infringement of our patent and effort to invalidate them operate without infringing on the intellectual property of others if we have properly drafted and enforceable patent it can be more difficult for our competitor to use our technology to create competitive product and more difficult for our competitor to obtain patent that prevents from using technology we create part of our business strategy we actively seek patent protection both in the united state and internationally and file additional patent application when appropriate to cover improvement in our compound product and technology patent application are confidential for period of time before patent is issued result we may not know if our competitor filed patent application for technology covered by our pending application or if we were the first to invent or first to file an application directed toward the technology that is the subject of our patent application in addition if competitor file patent application covering our technology we may have to participate in litigation post grant proceeding before the patent and trademark office or other proceeding to determine the right to patent or validity of any patent granted litigation post grant proceeding before the patent and trademark office or other proceeding are unpredictable and expensive and could divert management attention from other operation such that even if we are ultimately successful our result of operation may be adversely affected by such event generic manufacturer have sought and may continue to seek fda approval to market generic version of our product through an abbreviated new drug application anda the application process typically used by manufacturer seeking approval of generic drug for description of our anda litigation see note commitment and contingency of the note to consolidated financial statement included in item of our annual report on form the entry of generic version of our product may lead to market share and price erosion and have negative impact on our business and result of operation our success depends in large part on our ability to operate without infringing upon the patent or other proprietary right of third party if we infringe the valid patent of third party we may be required to pay significant monetary damage or we may be prevented from commercializing product or may be required to obtain license from these third party we may not be able to obtain alternative technology or any required license on commercially reasonable term or at all if we fail to obtain these license or alternative technology we may be unable to develop or commercialize some or all of our product for example we are aware of patent and patent application owned by third party that such party may claim cover the use of sofosbuvir axicabtagene ciloleucel and bictegravir see also description of our litigation regarding sofosbuvir axicabtagene ciloleucel and bictegravir in note commitment and contingency of the note to consolidated financial statement included in item of our annual report on form we are also aware of patent no and assigned to the department of health and human service that purport to claim process of protecting primate host from infection by an immunodeficiency retrovirus by administering combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir or tdf prior to exposure of the host to the immunodeficiency retrovirus we have been in contact with the department of health and human service about the scope and relevance of the patent and have explained that we do not believe that these patent are valid because the patent office wa not given the most relevant prior art and because physician and patient were using the claimed method year before the center for disease control and prevention filed the application for the patent furthermore we also rely on unpatented trade secret and improvement unpatented internal know how and technological innovation for example great deal of our liposomal manufacturing expertise which is key component of our liposomal technology is not covered by patent but is instead protected trade secret we protect these right mainly through confidentiality agreement with our corporate partner employee consultant and vendor we can not be certain that these party will comply with these confidentiality agreement that we have adequate remedy for any breach or that our trade secret internal know how or technological innovation will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitor under some of our agreement invention become jointly owned by and our corporate partner and in other case become the exclusive property of one party in certain circumstance it can be difficult to determine who owns particular invention and dispute could arise regarding those invention if our trade secret internal know how technological innovation or confidential information become known or independently discovered by competitor or if we enter into dispute over ownership of invention our business and result of operation could be adversely affected manufacturing problem including at our third party manufacturer and corporate partner could cause inventory shortage and delay product shipment and regulatory approval which may adversely affect our result of operation in order to generate revenue from our product we must be able to produce sufficient quantity of our product to satisfy demand many of our product are the result of complex manufacturing process the manufacturing process for pharmaceutical product is also highly regulated and regulator may shut down manufacturing facility that they believe do not comply with regulation our product are either manufactured at our own facility or by third party manufacturer or corporate partner we depend on third party to perform manufacturing activity effectively and on timely basis for the majority of our solid dose product our third party manufacturer and our corporate partner are subject to good manufacturing practice gmp which are extensive regulation governing manufacturing process stability testing record keeping and quality standard defined by fda and ema similar regulation are in effect in other jurisdiction our third party manufacturer and corporate partner are independent entity subject to their own unique operational and financial risk that are out of our control if we or any of these third party manufacturer or corporate partner fail to perform required this could impair our ability to deliver our product on timely basis or receive royalty or could cause delay in our clinical trial and application for regulatory approval further we may have to write the cost of manufacturing any batch that fails to pas quality inspection or meet regulatory approval in addition we our third party manufacturer and our corporate partner may only be able to produce some of our product at one or limited number of facility and therefore have limited manufacturing capacity for certain product and we may not be able to locate additional or replacement facility on reasonable basis or at all our sale of such product could also be adversely impacted by our reliance on such limited number of facility to the extent these risk materialize and affect their performance obligation to our financial result may be adversely affected our manufacturing operation are subject to routine inspection by regulatory agency if we are unable to remedy any deficiency cited by fda in these inspection our currently marketed product and the timing of regulatory approval of product in development could be adversely affected further there is risk that regulatory agency in other country where marketing application are pending will undertake similar additional review or apply heightened standard of review which could delay the regulatory approval for product in those country if approval of any of our product candidate were delayed or if production of our marketed product wa interrupted our anticipated revenue and our stock price would be adversely affected we may not be able to obtain material or supply necessary to conduct clinical trial or to manufacture and sell our product which would limit our ability to generate revenue we need access to certain supply and product to conduct our clinical trial and to manufacture our product if we are unable to purchase sufficient quantity of these material or find suitable alternate material in timely manner our development effort for our product candidate may be delayed or our ability to manufacture our product would be limited which would limit our ability to generate revenue supplier of key component and material must be named in the new drug application or marketing authorization application filed with the regulatory authority for any product candidate for which we are seeking marketing approval and significant delay can occur if the qualification of new supplier is required even after manufacturer is qualified by the regulatory authority the manufacturer must continue to expend time money and effort in the area of production and quality control to ensure full compliance with gmp manufacturer are subject to regular periodic inspection by the regulatory authority following initial approval if result of these inspection regulatory authority determines that the equipment facility laboratory or process do not comply with applicable regulation and condition of product approval the regulatory authority may suspend the manufacturing operation if the manufacturing operation of any of the single supplier for our product are suspended we may be unable to generate sufficient quantity of commercial or clinical supply of product to meet market demand which would in turn decrease our revenue and harm our business in addition if delivery of material from our supplier were interrupted for any reason we may be unable to ship certain of our product for commercial supply or to supply our product in development for clinical trial in addition some of our product and the material that we utilize in our operation are made at only one facility which we may not be able to replace in timely manner and on commercially reasonable term or at all problem with any of the single supplier we depend on including in the event of disaster such an earthquake equipment failure or other difficulty may negatively impact our development and commercialization effort significant portion of the raw material and intermediate used to manufacture our antiviral product are supplied by third party manufacturer and corporate partner outside of the united state result any political or economic factor in specific country or region including any change in or interpretation of trade regulation compliance requirement or tax legislation that would limit or prevent third party outside of the united state from supplying these material would adversely affect our ability to manufacture and supply our antiviral product to meet market need and have material and adverse effect on our operating result if we were to encounter any of these difficulty our ability to provide our product and product candidate to patient would be jeopardized import from country where our product are available at lower price and unapproved generic or counterfeit version of our product could have negative impact on our reputation and business price for our product are based on local market economics and competition and sometimes differ from country to country our sale in country with relatively higher price may be reduced if product can be imported into those or other country from lower price market if our hiv hbv and hcv product which we have agreed to make available at substantially reduced price to certain low and middle income country participating in our gilead access program are re exported from these low and income country into the united state europe or other higher price market our revenue would be adversely affected in addition we have entered into voluntary licensing agreement with generic drug company in india south africa and china well licensing agreement with the medicine patent pool united nation backed public health organization which allows generic drug company to manufacture generic version of hiv and hbv product incorporating our licensed compound taf cobicistat elvitegravir and bictegravir for distribution in certain low and middle income country we have also entered into agreement with generic manufacturer in india egypt and pakistan allowing them to produce and or distribute generic version of our hcv product in certain low and middle income country if generic version of our hiv hbv and hcv product produced and or distributed under these agreement are then re exported to the united state europe or other market outside of these low and middle income country our revenue would be adversely affected in addition purchase of our product in country where our selling price are relatively low for resale in country in which our selling price are relatively high may adversely impact our revenue and gross margin and may cause our sale to fluctuate from quarter to quarter additionally use of these diverted product could occur in country where they have not been approved and patient could source the product outside the legitimate supply chain therefore the product may be handled shipped and stored inappropriately which may affect the efficacy of the product and could harm patient our brand or the commercial or scientific reputation of our product in the european union we are required to permit product purchased in one eu member state to be sold in another eu member state purchase of our product in country where our selling price are relatively low for resale in country in which our selling price are relatively high can affect the inventory level held by our wholesaler and can cause the relative sale level in the various country to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and not reflect the actual consumer demand in any given quarter these quarterly fluctuation may impact our earnings which could adversely affect our stock price and harm our business we are also aware of the existence of various buyer club around the world that promote the personal importation of generic version of our hcv and hiv product that have not been approved for use in the country into which they are imported result patient may be at risk of taking unapproved medication which may not be they purport to be may not have the potency they claim to have or may contain harmful substance to the extent patient take unapproved generic version of one or more of our medication and are injured by these generic product our brand or the commercial or scientific reputation of our hcv and hiv product could be harmed further third party may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit version of our product which do not meet the rigorous quality standard of our manufacturing and supply chain for example in and there were report that product labeled epclusa wa available in multiple country which we determined wa not authentic product based on sample analysis and the lot number we have cooperated and continue to cooperate with regulatory authority to investigate this matter we actively take action to discourage counterfeit of our product around the world including working with local regulatory and legal authority to enforce law against counterfeit drug raising public awareness of the danger of counterfeit drug and promoting public policy to hinder the sale and availability of counterfeit drug counterfeit drug pose serious risk to patient health and safety and may raise the risk of product recall our reputation and business could suffer result of counterfeit drug sold under our brand name expensive litigation and government investigation have increased our expense which may continue to reduce our earnings we are involved in number of litigation investigation and other dispute related matter that require to expend substantial internal and financial resource we expect these matter will continue to require high level of internal and financial resource for the foreseeable future these matter have reduced and will

could materially reduce our earnings the testing manufacturing marketing and use of our commercial product well product candidate in development involve substantial risk of product liability claim these claim may be made directly by consumer healthcare provider pharmaceutical company or others we have limited insurance for product liability that may arise if we do not maintain adequate coverage or if claim exceed our coverage our financial condition will be adversely affected in addition negative publicity associated with any claim regardless of their merit may decrease the future demand for our product and impair our financial condition for description of our product liability matter see note commitment and contingency of the note to consolidated financial statement included in item of our annual report on form we fail to attract and retain highly qualified personnel we may be unable to successfully develop new product candidate conduct our clinical trial and commercialize our product candidate our future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific technical and management personnel well personnel with expertise in clinical testing governmental regulation and commercialization we face competition for personnel from other company university public and private research institution government entity and other organization competition for qualified personnel in the biopharmaceutical field is intense and there is limited pool of qualified potential employee to recruit we may not be able to attract and retain quality personnel on acceptable term additionally change to immigration and work authorization law and regulation could make it more difficult for employee to work in or transfer to jurisdiction in which we have operation and could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel if we are unsuccessful in our recruitment and retention effort our business may be harmed

regimen containing taf in addition we believe truvada for prep will continue to be an integral part of our growth in hiv in the united state community continue to embrace the public health benefit of prevention in hcv we expect decline in product sale result of lower patient start across all market and competitive factor although at lower rate than in we believe the launch of authorized generic

which more than million people receive our hiv medicine in low and middle income country progress on all of these initiative is subject to number of uncertainty including but not limited to the possibility of unfavorable result from new and ongoing clinical trial for example we recently announced that stellar phase study evaluating the safety and efficacy of selonsertib in patient with compensated cirrhosis due to nash did not meet the pre specified week primary endpoint the continuation of an uncertain global macroeconomic environment additional pricing pressure from payer and competitor slower than anticipated growth in our hiv product an increase in discount chargebacks and rebate due to ongoing contract and future negotiation with commercial and government payer market share and price erosion caused by the introduction of generic version of product containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tdf outside the united state and viread letairis and ranexa in the united

of our financial condition and result of operation is based on our consolidated financial statement included in item of this annual report on form which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle the preparation of these financial statement requires to make estimate and judgment that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense and related disclosure on an ongoing basis we evaluate and base our estimate on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumption that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance the result of which form the basis for making judgment about the carrying value of asset and liability that are not readily apparent from other source actual result may differ significantly from these estimate believe the following critical accounting policy reflect the more significant judgment and estimate used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statement revenue recognition adoption of asc topic revenue from contract with customer on january we adopted topic using the modified retrospective method whereby result for reporting period beginning after january are presented under topic while prior period amount are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting under topic under topic an entity recognizes revenue when it transfer control of promised good or service to customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those good or service we recorded the cumulative effect of applying the new revenue standard net increase of million to the opening balance of retained earnings the impact result of applying topic in place of topic wa not material for the year ended december product sale we recognize revenue from product sale when control of the product transfer generally upon shipment or delivery to the customer or in certain case upon the corresponding sale by our customer to third party we record product sale net of estimated mandatory and supplemental discount to government and private payer in addition to discount to private payer and other related charge these are generally accounted for variable consideration estimated in the same period the related sale occur government and other rebate and chargebacks represent the majority of our variable consideration and require complex and significant judgment by management estimate are assessed each period and updated to reflect current information government and other rebate and chargebacksgovernment and other rebate and chargebacks include amount paid to payer and healthcare provider in the united state including medicaid rebate aid drug assistance program rebate and chargebacks veteran administration and public health service chargebacks and other rebate well foreign government rebate rebate and chargebacks are based on contractual arrangement or statutory requirement which may vary by product by payer and individual payer plan for qualified program that can purchase our product through wholesaler or other distributor at lower contractual price the wholesaler or distributor charge back to the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual price our allowance for government and other rebate and chargebacks are estimated based on product sold historical payer mix pertinent third party industry information estimated patient population known market event or trend channel inventory data and or other market data we also consider new information regarding change in program regulation and guideline that would impact the amount of the actual rebate and or our expectation regarding future payer mix for these program we believe the methodology that we use to estimate our government and other rebate and chargebacks is reasonable and appropriate given the current fact and circumstance however actual result may differ significantly from our estimate historically our actual government rebate and chargebacks claimed for prior period have varied by le than from our estimate government and other chargebacks that are payable to our direct customer are classified reduction of account receivable on our consolidated balance sheet and totaled million and million at december and respectively government and other rebate that are invoiced directly to are recorded in accrued government and other rebate on our consolidated balance sheet and totaled billion and billion at december and respectively the following table summarizes the consolidated activity and ending balance in our government and other rebate and chargebacks account in million accrued government and other rebate and chargebacks balance at beginning of year decrease increase to product sale payment balance at end of yearyear ended december activity related to sale related to sale prior to ended december activity related to sale related to sale prior to contingencieswe are party to various legal action the most significant of these are described in note commitment and contingency legal proceeding of the note to consolidated financial statement included in item of this annual report on form it is not possible to determine the outcome of these matter we recognize accrual for such action to the extent that we conclude that loss is both probable and reasonably estimable we accrue for the best estimate of loss within range however if no estimate in the range is better than any other then we accrue the minimum amount in the range if we determine that loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the possible loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable because of the inherent uncertainty and unpredictability related to these matter accrual are based on what we believe to be the best information available at the time of our assessment including the legal fact and circumstance of the case status of the proceeding applicable law and the view of legal counsel upon the final resolution of such matter it is possible that there may be loss in excess of the amount recorded and such amount could have material adverse effect on our result of operation cash flow or financial position we periodically reassess these matter when additional information becomes available and adjust our estimate and assumption when fact and circumstance indicate the need for any change we did not recognize any accrual in our consolidated balance sheet for such matter of december and we did not believe loss were probable valuation of intangible asset the identifiable intangible asset are measured at their respective fair value of the acquisition date and may be subject to revision within the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date the model used in valuing these intangible asset require the use of significant estimate and assumption including but not limited to estimate of revenue and operating profit related to the product or product candidate the probability of success for unapproved product candidate considering their stage of development the time and resource needed to complete the development and approval of product candidate the life of the potential commercialized product and associated risk including the inherent difficulty and uncertainty in developing product candidate such obtaining fda and other regulatory approval and risk related to the viability of and potential alternative treatment in any future target market we believe the fair value used to record intangible asset acquired in connection with business combination using information known and knowable and are based upon reasonable estimate and assumption given the fact and circumstance of the related valuation date intangible asset related to ipr project are considered to be indefinite lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated effort if and when development is complete which generally occurs if and when regulatory approval to market product is obtained the associated asset would be deemed finite lived and would then be amortized based on their respective estimated useful life at that point in time during the period the asset are considered indefinite lived they are not amortized but are tested for impairment on an annual basis well between annual test if we become aware of any event or change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the ipr project are below their respective carrying amount the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible asset is dependent on assumption such the expected timing or probability of achieving the specified milestone change in projected revenue or change in discount rate significant judgment is employed in determining these assumption and change to our assumption could have significant impact on our result of operation in any given period intangible asset with finite useful life are amortized over their estimated useful life primarily on straight line basis intangible asset with finite useful life are reviewed for impairment when fact or circumstance suggest that the carrying value of these asset may not be recoverable on october in connection with our kite acquisition we acquired intangible asset primarily related to ipr for axicabtagene ciloleucel kite an anti bcma being evaluated for the treatment of multiple myeloma and kte being evaluated for the treatment of adult and pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia which had an estimated aggregate fair value of billion on october fda approved axicabtagene ciloleucel known commercially yescarta making it the first car cell therapy for the treatment of adult patient with relapsed or refractory large cell lymphoma after two or more line of systemic therapy which includes diffuse large cell lymphoma transformed follicular lymphoma and primary mediastinal cell lymphoma upon approval we reclassified billion of the purchased ipr finite lived intangible asset we are amortizing this asset over an estimated useful life of year using the straight line method during the fourth quarter of we concluded that the efficacy profile of the kite program did not justify further effort based on the totality of the clinical data gathered and made decision to discontinue the kite program result estimated fair value of the ipr relating to the kite program wa written down to zero and we recorded an impairment charge of million within research and development expense on our consolidated statement of income included in item of this annual report on form provision for income taxeswe estimate our income tax provision including deferred tax asset and liability based on significant management judgment we evaluate the realization of all or portion of our deferred tax asset on quarterly basis we record valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset to the amount that are more likely than not to be realized we consider future taxable income ongoing tax planning strategy and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for valuation allowance if we expect to realize deferred tax asset for which we have previously recorded valuation allowance we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made the valuation allowance wa million and million at december and respectively the increase of our valuation allowance in wa primarily related to certain kite tax attribute and certain foreign jurisdiction which do not have sufficient history of profit to realize the benefit of the loss on more likely than not basis we are subject to income tax in the united state and various foreign jurisdiction including ireland due to economic and political condition various country are actively considering and have made change to existing tax law for example the united state enacted significant tax reform and certain provision of the new law will continue to significantly affect we can not predict the form or timing of potential legislative change that could have material adverse impact on our result of operation in addition significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income tax we record liability related to uncertain tax position in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax recognized in an enterprise financial statement by prescribing minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax position taken or expected to be taken in tax return an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax position in any period could have material impact on the result of operation for that period of the total unrecognized tax benefit billion and billion at december and if recognized would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition of december we believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefit will decrease by approximately million in the next month due to potential settlement with taxing authority we file federal state and foreign income tax return in the united state and in many foreign jurisdiction for federal income tax purpose the statute of limitation is open for and onwards and and onwards for california income tax purpose for certain acquired entity the statute of limitation is open for all year from inception due to our utilization of their net operating loss and credit carried over from prior year our income tax return are subject to audit by federal state and foreign tax authority we are currently under examination by the irs for the tax year from to and by various state and foreign jurisdiction there are differing interpretation of tax law and regulation and result significant dispute may arise with these tax authority involving issue of the timing and amount of deduction and allocation of income among various tax jurisdiction we

process research and development ipr project and liability assumed be recorded at their fair value of the acquisition date on our consolidated balance sheet any excess of purchase price over the fair value of net asset acquired is recorded goodwill the determination of estimated fair value requires to make significant estimate and assumption result we may record adjustment to the fair value of asset acquired and liability assumed within the measurement period up to one year from the acquisition date with the corresponding offset to goodwill transaction cost associated with business combination are expensed they are incurred when we determine net asset acquired do not meet the definition of business combination under the acquisition method of accounting the transaction is accounted for an acquisition of asset rather than business combination and therefore no goodwill is recorded goodwill and intangible assetsgoodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the estimated fair value of asset acquired and liability assumed in business combination intangible asset with indefinite useful life are related to purchased ipr project and are measured at their respective fair value of the acquisition date we do not amortize goodwill and intangible asset with indefinite useful life intangible asset related to ipr project are considered to be indefinite lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated effort if and when development is complete which generally occurs if and when regulatory approval to market product is obtained the associated asset are deemed finite lived and are amortized based on their respective estimated useful life at that point in time we test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment on an annual basis and in between annual test if we become aware of any event or circumstance that would indicate the fair value of the asset are below their carrying amount intangible asset with finite useful life are amortized over their estimated useful life primarily on straight line basis and are reviewed for impairment when fact or circumstance suggest that the carrying value of these asset may not be recoverable of long lived asset long lived asset including property plant and equipment and finite lived intangible asset are reviewed for impairment whenever fact or circumstance either internally or externally may suggest that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable should there be an indication of impairment we test for recoverability by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flow expected to result from the use of the asset to the carrying amount of the asset or asset group any excess of the carrying value of the asset or asset group over it estimated fair value is recognized an impairment loss foreign currency translation transaction gain and loss and hedging contract non entity operation are recorded in the

related to outstanding monetary asset and liability well forecasted product sale using foreign currency exchange forward contract in general the market risk related to these contract is offset by corresponding gain and loss on the hedged transaction the credit risk associated with these contract is driven by change in interest and currency exchange rate and result varies over time by working only with major bank and closely monitoring current market condition we seek to limit the risk that counterparties to these contract may be unable to perform we also seek to limit our risk of loss by entering into contract that permit net settlement at maturity therefore our overall risk of loss in the event of counterparty default is limited to the amount of any unrealized gain on outstanding contract those contract that have positive fair value at the date of default we do not enter into derivative contract for trading purpose fair value of financial instrument we apply fair value accounting for all financial asset and liability and non financial asset and liability that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statement on recurring basis we define fair value the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date when determining the fair value measurement for asset and liability which are required to be recorded at fair value we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market based risk measurement or assumption that market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability such risk inherent in valuation technique transfer restriction and credit risk derivative financial instrumentswe recognize all derivative instrument either asset or liability at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet change in the fair value of derivative are recorded each period in current

derivative that are used in hedging transaction are effective in offsetting the change in cash flow or fair value of the hedged item if we determine that forecasted transaction is probable of not
