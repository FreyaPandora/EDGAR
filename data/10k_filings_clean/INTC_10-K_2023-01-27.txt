csps increasing cost of and capacity for advanced node technology supply chain risk highlighted by the pandemic and geo political issue these transformation trend are driving significant semiconductor market growth in leading edge advanced node driven by mobile compute and automotive application the increasing heterogeneity of chip increase the complexity of designing chip with optimized ppac that are manufacturable with high yield additionally integrating these diverse chip into system becomes more complex and requires optimized interconnects and software stack that can easily accept this diversity of chip without compromising ppac this is causing paradigm shift from focusing on optimizing device to focusing on optimizing the system known system technology co optimization in this new paradigm customer require solution that address every layer of the application stack rather than just the chip additionally the covid pandemic and recent geo political issue have highlighted the world dependence on semiconductor and the vulnerable supply chain that underpins the industry approximately of the world semiconductor manufacturing capacity is in asia and only is in the product and competitionwe seek to address this tectonic shift in the industry by creating an open system foundry that enables our customer to lead in their industry by creating full stack solution from their choice of the best of intel and the ecosystem the open system foundry ha four component wafer fabrication packaging chiplet standard and software the open system foundry involves engaging with customer at multiple level from basic wafer manufacturing to helping define and implement their desired system architecture we intend to build our customer silicon design and deliver full end to end capability to produce their product built with our advanced packaging technology and delivered from resilient geo diverse and sustainable source of supply the foundation of our ifs strategy is world class foundry offering consisting of process technology complemented by robust ecosystem for ip eda and design service chip created with ifs can be packaged using our advanced packaging technology or by osats and connected by optimized interconnects that we will help drive standard for the industry such ucie we expect to accelerate our customer design by providing service and software that leverage our vast experience in designing system of chip and by providing core from intel and the ecosystem that are optimized for intel process technology the combination of core and accelerator can be seamlessly integrated into system using oneapi these offering will accelerate customer time to value with ppac optimized system delivered from reliable supply chain our competitor are mostly pure play foundry that focus on delivering pure play foundry offering from fabrication plant based in asia of the five major semiconductor foundry taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation tsmc samsung global foundry gf united microelectronics corporation umc and semiconductor manufacturing international corporation only samsung is an idm and foundry and only gf is headquartered in the tsmc and samsung are the only company with advanced technology below and tsmc lead the market with market share followed by samsung at in neither samsung nor tsmc currently offer it most advanced node outside of asia and both have limited advanced node capacity in the we believe the open system foundry model will deliver differentiated capability to help our customer lead in their industry while bringing stability to the global semiconductor supply chain the interest we are seeing from customer demonstrates that our strategy and offering are resonating and we look to continue to build on this

rate debt that is swapped to floating rate debt hypothetical increase in interest rate of would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately million from debt outstanding of december hypothetical increase of would have resulted in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately million from debt outstanding of december equity priceswe are exposed to equity market risk through our investment in marketable equity security which we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate through hedging activity of december the fair value of our marketable equity security wa billion billion of december the substantial majority of our marketable equity security portfolio of december wa concentrated in security traded on the chinese shanghai stock exchange science and technology innovation board to determine reasonably possible decrease in the market value of our marketable equity security we have analyzed the historical market price sensitivity of our portfolio assuming decline of in market price the aggregate value of our marketable equity security could decrease by approximately million based on the value of december decrease in value of approximately billion based on the value of december using an assumed decline of other key of contentswe utilize total return swap to offset change in liability related to the equity market risk of certain deferred compensation arrangement gain or loss from change in fair value of these total return swap are generally offset by the loss or gain on the related liability many of the same factor that could result in an adverse movement of equity market price affect our non marketable equity investment although we can not always quantify the impact directly financial market are volatile which could negatively affect the prospect of the company we invest in their ability to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investment through liquidity event such ipo merger and private sale these type of investment involve great deal of risk and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful consequently we could lose all or part of our investment our non marketable equity security had carrying amount of billion of december billion of december and include our investment in beijing unisoc technology ltd of billion billion of december commodity price riskalthough we operate facility that consume commodity we are not directly affected by commodity price risk to material degree we have established forecasted transaction risk management program to protect against fluctuation in commodity price we may use commodity derivative contract such commodity swap in these hedging program in addition we have sourcing plan in place that are designed to mitigate the risk of potential supplier concentration for our key commodity risk factorsthe following summarizes the material factor that make an investment in our security speculative or risky when any one or more of the following risk materialize from time to time our business reputation financial condition cash flow and result of operation can be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline these risk factor do not identify all risk that we face our operation can also be affected by factor that are not presently known to or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operation due to risk and uncertainty known and unknown our past financial result may not be reliable indicator of future performance and historical trend should not be used to anticipate result or trend in future period refer also to the other information set forth in this form including in the md and financial statement and supplemental detail section change in product demand can adversely affect our financial result demand for our product is variable and hard to predict our product are used in different market segment and demand for our product varies within or among them it is difficult to forecast these change and their impact for example we expect the pc tam to grow over time driven by factor such larger installed base new platform shorter replacement cycle and adoption in new market however the pc industry ha been highly cyclical in the past and these growth expectation may not materialize or we may fail to capitalize on them change in the demand for our product particularly our ccg dcai and nex platform product have reduced and can in the future reduce our revenue lower our gross margin or require to write down the value of our asset important factor that lead to variation in the demand for our product include business condition including downturn in the market segment in which we operate or in global or regional economy consumer confidence income level and customer capital spending which can be impacted by change in market condition including change in government borrowing or spending taxation interest rate the credit market current or expected inflation employment and energy or other commodity price geopolitical condition including trade policy our ability to timely introduce competitive product competitive and pricing pressure including new product introduction and other action taken by competitor the level of our customer inventory and computing capacity customer order pattern and order cancellation including result of maturing product cycle for our product customer product and related product such operating system upgrade cycle and disruption affecting customer such the delay in obtaining tool component and other supply result of covid related port shutdown in china that negatively impacted demand for our business in well the industry substrate and component shortage that negatively impacted demand across several of our business in market acceptance and industry support of our product and service including the introduction and availability of software and other product used together with our product well our foundry service offering through ifs and customer product need and emerging technology trend including change in the level and nature of customer and end user computing workload such work hybrid and learn from home trend other key of contentsdue to the complexity of our manufacturing operation we are not always able to timely respond to fluctuation in demand and we may incur significant charge and cost because we own and operate high tech fabrication facility our operation have high cost that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term including our cost related to utilization of existing facility facility construction and equipment and the employment and training of highly skilled workforce to the extent product demand decrease or we fail to forecast demand accurately our gross margin and operating income can be disproportionately affected due to our high fixed cost structure which is difficult to reduce in response to lower revenue we could also be required to write off inventory or record excess manufacturing capacity charge which would also lower our gross margin and operating income to the extent the demand decrease is prolonged our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized and we may be required to write down our long lived asset which would increase our expense we may also be required to shorten the useful life of under used facility and equipment and accelerate depreciation we continue to make substantial investment in increasing our manufacturing capacity part of our idm strategy these underutilization risk may be heightened conversely at time demand increase or we fail to forecast accurately or produce the mix of product demanded to the extent we are unable to add capacity or increase production fast enough we are at time required to make production decision and or are unable to fully meet market demand which can result in loss of revenue opportunity or market share legal claim and or damage to customer relationship our idm investment in capacity and our process technology roadmap require capital expenditure above our historical level and if demand for our ifs business grows rapidly we anticipate that we would need to accelerate our planned investment to meet that demand to the extent we do not generate expected cash flow we may be required to increase our use of external funding source to fund our investment and operation which may not be available on favorable term or at all legislation in the and eu ha been adopted to provide government funding for semiconductor manufacturing expansion in those region but there is uncertainty to the amount and timing of funding we may receive and to any restriction on recipient to the extent such funding is below our expectation our anticipated cash requirement would increase our construction project to expand capacity require available source of labor material and equipment increasing demand for such source including from other foundry supply constraint labor shortage and other adverse market condition issue with permit or approval on site incident and other construction issue arise from time to time and can result in significant delay and increased cost for our project well legal and reputational harm we face significant competition the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological geopolitical and market development change in industry standard change in customer and end user need expectation and preference and frequent product introduction and improvement when we do not anticipate or respond to these development our competitive position can weaken and our product or technology can become uncompetitive or obsolete our competitive environment ha intensified and we expect it to continue to do so in the future our product primarily compete based on performance energy efficiency integration ease of use innovative design feature workload optimization price quality reliability security software ecosystem and developer support time to market reliable product roadmap execution brand recognition customer support and customization and availability the importance of these factor varies by product and market segment for example our competitor have introduced data center and client platform product with performance improvement and additional processor core count that have contributed to an increasingly competitive environment in our iotg business within nex for example interoperability connectivity safety security industrial use condition and long life support are among the key competitive factor to the extent our product do not meet our customer requirement across these factor in an increasingly competitive landscape our business and result of operation can be harmed we face intense competition across our product portfolio from company offering platform product such amd and qualcomm accelerator product such gpus including those offered by nvidia other accelerator product such asics application specific standard product and fpgas memory and storage product connectivity and networking product and other semiconductor product some of these competitor have developed or utilize competing computing architecture and platform such the arm architecture and these architecture and platform can produce beneficial network effect for competitor when an ecosystem of customer and application developer for such architecture and platform grows at scale for example arm based product are being used in pc and server which could lead to further development and growth of the arm ecosystem we also compete with internally developed semiconductor from oems cloud service provider and others some of are customer some of these customer vertically integrate their own semiconductor design with their software asset and or customize their design for specific computing workload for example in apple introduced pc product utilizing it own internally developed arm based semiconductor design in place of our client cpu and we face increasing competition from apple product and ecosystem most of our competitor rely on third party foundry such tsmc or samsung electronics co ltd and subcontractor for manufacture and assembly and test of their semiconductor component and product manufacturing process improvement introduced by tsmc have contributed and may continue to contribute to increasingly competitive offering by our competitor while we have set out process technology roadmap to attain future process performance per watt parity and leadership relative to tsmc our plan are subject to number of risk and we could fail to realize our goal including due to change in competitor technology roadmaps change affecting our projection regarding our technology or competing technology and the risk described in the section we are vulnerable to product and manufacturing related risk an idm we have higher capital expenditure and spending than many of our fable competitor we also face new source of competition result of change in industry participant through for example acquisition or business collaboration well new entrant including in china which could have significant impact on our competitive position for example we could face increased competition result of china program to promote domestic semiconductor industry and supply chain other key of contentsintroduction of competitive new product and technology aggressive pricing and other action taken by competitor can harm demand for our product exert downward pricing pressure on our product and adversely affect our business for example our dcai revenue and platform asp were negatively impacted by the competitive environment during and additionally number of business combination and strategic partnership in the semiconductor industry have occurred over the last several year and more could occur in the future for example in broadcom announced an agreement to acquire vmware and amd completed it acquisition of xilinx inc consolidation could also lead to fewer customer partner or supplier any of which could negatively affect our financial result if we are not able to compete effectively our financial result will be adversely affected including reduced revenue and gross margin and we may be required to accelerate the write down of the value of certain asset we invest significantly in and to the extent our effort are unsuccessful our competitive position can be harmed and we may not realize return on our investment to compete successfully we must maintain an effective program develop new product and manufacturing process and improve our existing product and process all ahead of competitor our effort intensely utilize our different form of capital and we incurred expense of billion in billion in billion in we are focusing our effort across several key area including process and packaging technology our xpu product and feature and software these include ambitious initiative such our unified oneapi portfolio of developer tool we can not guarantee that all of these effort will deliver the benefit we anticipate for example we previously experienced significant delay in the implementation of our process technology and during we announced that our intel process technology formerly would be delayed relative to our prior expectation to the extent we do not timely introduce new manufacturing process technology that improve performance performance per watt and or transistor density with sufficient manufacturing yield and operational efficiency relative to competing foundry process we can face cost product performance and time to market disadvantage in addition period of extended investment in and operational strategy can impact our financial condition and planning and may result in period of higher leverage operating cost borrowing cost and pressure on our credit rating further we are not always able to timely or successfully develop new product including result of bug late change to feature due to customer request or other design challenge for example in we announced that the release of our sapphire rapid product would be delayed from the first half of to the second half of to the extent our effort do not develop new product on schedule with improvement in area like performance performance per watt die utilization and core count and or with new feature such optimization for ai and other workload our competitive position can be harmed we have adopted disaggregated design approach for some of our future product in which different processor and component can be manufactured on different process and connected by advanced packaging technology into single package this approach introduces new area of complexity in design and manufacturability particularly in the deployment of advanced packaging technology several of which are novel have limited manufacturing history and or have increased cost delay or failure in implementing disaggregated design could adversely affect our ability to timely introduce competitive product for example adapting processor or component design for new or different manufacturing process involves additional expense and can result in delay in the development of the associated product and higher cost due to the utilization of more advanced and expensive capital equipment we do not expect all of our investment to be successful some of our effort to develop and market new product and technology fail or fall short of our expectation or are not well received by customer who may adopt competing technology we make significant investment in and our investment are growing we pursue our idm strategy our investment at time do not contribute to our future operating result for several year if at all and such contribution at time do not meet our expectation or even cover the cost of such investment our investment in new business product and technology are inherently risky and do not always succeed we have entered new area and introduced new product and service we seek to capitalize on the opportunity presented by ubiquitous computing cloud to edge infrastructure pervasive connectivity and ai in recent year we have expanded our product offering in area such discrete gpus mobility solution ai accelerator ipu product and silicon photonics part of our idm strategy we announced plan to establish ifs major provider of foundry capacity to manufacture semiconductor for others and to implement an internal foundry operating model through update to our process system and guardrail between our manufacturing and our individual business unit ifs face competition from well established competitor such tsmc and samsung and to succeed we will need to compete effectively across factor such availability and time to market of manufacturing technology advance in manufacturing process in area such performance performance per watt and density manufacturing capacity price margin ease of use quality yield customer satisfaction and ecosystem support our big bet are inherently risky and are not always successful for example in we wound down intel optane in we agreed to sell our nand memory business to sk hynix and in we exited the smartphone modem business three of our prior big bet based on our determination that there wa no clear path to profitability for those business these new and developing area and product represent significant portion of our revenue growth opportunity and they also introduce new source of competition including in some case incumbent competitor with established technology ecosystem and customer base lower price margin or cost and greater brand recognition these developing product and market segment require significant investment do not always grow projected or at all or sometimes adopt competing technology and we may not realize an adequate return on our investment for example ai and machine learning are increasingly driving innovation in technology but if we fail to develop leading product for these workload or if our customer use competing technology we may not realize return on our investment in these area similarly while we see significant opportunity in networking infrastructure and the distribution of computing to the network edge we expect intense competition for this opportunity and may not succeed in our effort to be successful we need to cultivate relationship with customer and partner in these market segment and continue to improve our offering despite our ongoing effort there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain market demand or acceptance for our product and service in these various market segment or realize an adequate return on our investment which could lead to impairment of asset and restructuring charge well opportunity cost other key of contentschanges in the mix of product sold can materially impact our financial result our pricing and margin vary across our product and market segment due in part to marketability of our product and difference in their feature or manufacturing cost for example our platform product offering range from lower priced and entry level platform such those based on intel atom processor to higher end platform based on intel xeon processor our adjacent product also typically have significantly lower margin than our higher priced platform product and at time are not profitable to the extent demand shift from our higher priced to lower priced platform product in any of our market segment or our adjacent product represent greater share of our mix of product sold our gross margin percentage ha decreased and may decrease we are vulnerable to product and manufacturing related risk we are subject to risk associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing technology production of integrated circuit is complex process we are continually engaged in the development of next generation process technology at increasingly advanced node we seek to realize the benefit of moore law forecasting our progress and schedule for developing advanced node is challenging and at time we encounter unexpected delay due to the complexity of interaction among step in the manufacturing process challenge in using new material or new production equipment and other issue diagnosing defect in our manufacturing process often take long time manufacturing throughput time can delay our receipt of data about defect and the effectiveness of fix and defect can be more serious and difficult to resolve than initially understood we are not always successful or efficient in developing or implementing new process node and manufacturing process we experienced significant delay in implementing our process technology and in we encountered defect mode in the development of our intel process technology formerly that resulted in delay relative to our prior expectation in sapphire rapid wa also delayed to build in more platform and product validation time these delay have allowed competitor using third party foundry such tsmc to benefit from advancement in manufacturing process introduced ahead of by these competing foundry including improvement in performance energy efficiency and other feature which have helped increase the competitiveness of their product because of these prior delay in our process technology we may experience greater adverse competitive impact in the event of delay in the development of future manufacturing process technology and product our effort to innovate involve significant expense and carry inherent risk including difficulty in designing and developing next generation process and packaging technology and investment in manufacturing asset and facility that are made year in advance of the technology introduction we can not guarantee that we will realize the expected benefit of next generation process technology including the expected cost performance power and density advantage or that we will achieve an adequate return on our capital and investment particularly development of new node ha grown increasingly expensive in such circumstance we may be required to write down the value of some of our manufacturing asset and facility increasing our expense risk inherent in the development of next generation process technology include production timing delay lower than anticipated manufacturing yield longer manufacturing throughput time failure to achieve expected performance power and area improvement and product defect and erratum production timing delay have at time caused to miss customer product design window which can result in lost revenue opportunity and damage to our customer relationship furthermore when the introduction of next generation process node is delayed adding core or other competitive feature to our product can result in larger die size product manufacturing supply constraint and increased product cost lower manufacturing yield and longer manufacturing throughput time compared to previous process node can increase our product cost and adversely affect our gross margin and can contribute to manufacturing supply constraint new process node typically ha higher cost compared to mature node due to factor that include higher depreciation cost and lower yield and cost and yield at time do not improve at the same rate on prior node the die size of our product ha increased and our manufacturing process node have shrunk our product and manufacturing process have grown increasingly complex and more susceptible to product defect and erratum which at time also contribute to production timing delay and lower yield from time to time disruption in the production process result from error defect in material delay in obtaining or revising permit and license interruption in our supply of material resource or production equipment adverse change in equipment productivity and disruption at our fabrication and assembly and test facility due to accident maintenance issue power interruption equipment malfunction or unsafe working condition all of which could affect the timing of production ramp and yield production issue periodically lead to increased cost and affect our ability to meet product demand which can adversely impact our business and the result of operation in addition delay in our product introduction can cause to become le competitive and lose revenue opportunity and our gross margin could be adversely affected because we incur significant cost up front in product lifecycle stage and earn revenue to offset these cost over time we face supply chain risk we have highly complex global supply chain composed of thousand of supplier these supplier provide direct material for our production process supply tool equipment and ip via license for our factory deliver logistics and packaging service and supply software lab and office equipment and other good and service used in our business we also rely on supplier to provide certain component for our product and to manufacture and assemble and test some of our component and product from time to time we are negatively impacted by supply chain issue including supplier extending lead time experiencing capacity constraint limiting or canceling supply allocating supply to other customer including competitor delaying or canceling delivery or increasing price supplier quality issue cybersecurity event ip or other litigation manmade or natural disaster operational failure or other event that disrupt supplier long lead time to qualify alternate or additional supplier or the unavailability of qualified alternate supplier andother key of content increased legislation regulation or stakeholder expectation regarding responsible sourcing practice such heightened reporting and other obligation with regard to environmental impact the risk of forced labor or supplier conduct that doe not meet such standard which can result in supply chain disruption the loss of supplier and the government seizure of good well cause our compliance cost to increase or result in publicity that negatively affect our reputation these and other supply chain issue can increase our cost disrupt or reduce our production delay our product shipment prevent from meeting customer demand and damage our customer relationship they may keep from successfully implementing our business strategy and can materially harm our business competitive position result of operation and financial condition from time to time our customer experience disruption or shortage in their own supply chain that constrain their demand for our product during macroeconomic and geopolitical condition well outbreak of covid in certain region of the world caused supply chain disruption and delay in obtaining tool and other component while in the semiconductor industry experienced widespread shortage of substrate and other component and available foundry manufacturing capacity these shortage have previously limited our ability to supply customer demand in certain of our business such for our fpga product and have adversely affected customer demand for our product including in our ccg and dcai business some customer have been unable to procure sufficient quantity of third party component used together with our product to produce finished system it is difficult to predict the future impact of these shortage when they occur to obtain future supply of certain material and component particularly substrate and third party foundry manufacturing capacity we have entered into arrangement with some of our supplier that involve long term purchase commitment and or large prepayment these arrangement may not be adequate to meet our requirement or our supplier may fail to deliver committed volume on time or at all or their financial condition may deteriorate if future customer demand over the horizon of such arrangement fall below our expectation we could have excess or obsolete inventory unneeded capacity and increased cost and our prepayment may not be fully utilized and in some case may not be fully recoverable we utilize third party foundry and component supplier to manufacture or supply certain component and product for area such networking communication graphic programmable semiconductor solution and memory part of our idm strategy we expect to increase our use of third party foundry for manufacturing which will include modular tile manufactured on advanced foundry process technology for use in our core computing offering delay in the development of foundry future manufacturing process could delay the introduction of product or component we design for such process and insufficient foundry capacity could prevent from meeting customer demand we typically have le control over delivery schedule design and manufacturing co optimization manufacturing yield quality product quantity and cost for component and product that are manufactured by third party where possible we seek to have several source of supply however for certain component service material and equipment we rely on single or limited number of supplier or upon supplier in single location for example asml is currently the sole supplier of euv photolithography tool that we will be deploying in our intel and other future manufacturing process node these tool are highly complex to develop and produce and increasingly costly and from time to time there are increase in lead time or delay in their development and availability which could delay the development or ramp of our future process node further example limited number of third party foundry offer leading edge manufacturing process and these provider are geographically concentrated in asia supplier consolidation or business failure can also reduce the pool of qualified supplier sole or limited source supplier can impact the nature quality availability and pricing of the product and service available to and intensify the other risk described in this risk factor our disaggregated design strategy introduces additional production risk our disaggregated design strategy pose increased logistical risk and challenge particularly where we decide to manufacture different product component on different process technology including third party foundry process technology to combine component in single package they need to be manufactured on timely basis and in sufficient quantity while the manufacturing process we utilize may have differing yield throughput time and capacity constraint we may be required to safely store some component pending the manufacture of others delay or quality issue with one component could limit our ability to manufacture the entire completed product in addition the packaging technology used to combine these component can increase our cost and may introduce additional complexity and quality issue to the extent we are unable to manage these risk our ability to timely supply competitive product can be harmed and our cost could increase we are subject to the risk of product defect erratum or other product issue from time to time we identify product defect erratum deviation from published specification and other product issue which can result from problem in our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test process component and product we purchase or license from third party supplier or gain through acquisition can also contain defect product issue also sometimes result from the interaction between our product and third party product and software we face risk if product that we design manufacture or sell or that include our technology cause personal injury or property damage even where the cause is unrelated to product defect or erratum these risk may increase our product are introduced into new device market segment technology or application including transportation autonomous driving healthcare communication financial service and other industrial critical infrastructure and consumer us cost from defect erratum or other product issue could include writing off some or all of the value of inventory recalling product that have been shipped providing product replacement or modification providing consideration to customer including reimbursement for certain cost they incur defending against litigation and or paying resulting damage andother key of content paying fine imposed by regulatory agency these cost could be large and may increase expense and lower gross margin and or result in delay or loss of revenue mitigation technique designed to address product issue including software and firmware update are not always available on timely basis or at all and do not always operate intended or effectively resolve such issue for all application we and third party such hardware and software vendor make prioritization decision about which product issue to address which can delay limit or prevent development or deployment of mitigation and harm our reputation and result in cost product defect erratum or other product issue and or mitigation technique can result in product failure adverse performance and power effect reboots system instability or unavailability loss of functionality data loss or corruption unpredictable system behavior decision by customer and end user to limit or change the application in which they use our product or product feature and other issue product issue can damage our reputation negatively affect product demand delay product release or deployment result in legal liability or make our product le competitive which could harm our business and financial result subsequent event or new information can develop that change our assessment of the impact of product issue in addition our liability insurance coverage ha certain exclusion or may not adequately cover liability incurred our insurance provider may be unable or unwilling to pay claim and loss not covered by insurance could be large which could harm our financial condition we face risk related to security vulnerability in our product we or third party regularly identify security vulnerability with respect to our processor and other product well the operating system and workload that run on them and the component that interact with them component and ip we purchase or license from third party for use in our product well industry standard specification we implement in our product are also regularly subject to security vulnerability our processor and other product are being used in application area that create new or increased cybersecurity and privacy risk including application that gather and process large amount of data such the cloud or internet of thing and critical infrastructure and automotive application the security vulnerability identified in our processor include category known side channel vulnerability such the variant referred to spectre and meltdown additional category and variant have been identified and are expected to continue to be identified publicity about these and other security vulnerability ha resulted in and is expected to continue to result in increased attempt by third party to identify additional vulnerability security and manageability feature in our product can not make our product absolutely secure and these feature themselves are subject to vulnerability and attempt by third party to identify additional vulnerability vulnerability are not always mitigated before they become known we our customer and the user of our product do not always promptly learn of or have the ability to fully ass the magnitude or effect of vulnerability including the extent if any to which vulnerability ha been exploited subsequent event or new information can develop that change our assessment of the impact of security vulnerability including additional information learned we develop and deploy mitigation or update become aware of additional variant evaluate the competitiveness of existing and new product and address future warranty or other claim or customer satisfaction consideration well development in the course of any litigation or regulatory inquiry or action over these matter mitigation technique designed to address security vulnerability including software and firmware update or other preventative measure are not always available on timely basis or at all and at time do not operate intended or effectively resolve vulnerability for all application in addition we are often required to rely on third party including hardware software and service vendor well our customer and end user to develop and or deploy mitigation technique and the availability effectiveness and performance impact of mitigation technique can depend solely or in part on the action of these third party in determining whether when and how to develop and deploy mitigation export restriction may impede our ability to provide update or patch to customer in certain geography or that appear on sanction list potentially leaving system unpatched and open to exploitation further sanction list may include third party with whom we need to interact for coordinated vulnerability disclosure which may impair our ability to receive information about vulnerability and to deliver mitigation for them we and such third party make prioritization decision about which vulnerability to address which can delay limit or prevent development or deployment of mitigation and harm our reputation security vulnerability and or mitigation technique can result in adverse performance or power effect reboots system instability or unavailability loss of functionality data loss or corruption unpredictable system behavior decision by customer and end user to limit or change the application in which they use our product or product feature and or the misappropriation of data by third party security vulnerability and any limitation or adverse effect of mitigation technique can adversely affect our result of operation financial condition customer relationship prospect and reputation in number of way any of which may be material for example whether or not vulnerability involve attempted or successful exploit they may result in our incurring significant cost related to developing and deploying update and mitigation writing down inventory value defending against product claim and litigation responding to regulatory inquiry or action paying damage addressing customer satisfaction consideration providing product replacement or modification or taking other remedial step with respect to third party adverse publicity about security vulnerability or mitigation could damage our reputation with customer or user and reduce demand for our product and service these effect may be greater to the extent that competing product are not susceptible to the same vulnerability or if vulnerability can be more effectively mitigated in competing product moreover third party can release information regarding potential vulnerability of our product before mitigation are available which in turn could lead to attempted or successful exploit adversely affect our ability to introduce mitigation or otherwise harm our business and reputation other key of contentswe are subject to risk associated with environmental health and safety and product regulation the design manufacturing assembly and test of our product require the use and purchase of material and chemical that are subject to broad array of environmental health and safety law and regulation our operation and those of our supplier are further governed by regulation prohibiting the use of forced labor mining conflict mineral and restriction on other material well law or regulation governing the operation of our facility sale and distribution of our product and use of our real property the scope and interpretation of such law and regulation including the material they govern are complex and continue to evolve the procedure and process in place under our compliance program may become onerous or increasingly expensive to maintain and can not guarantee compliance by employee or third party to whom such law apply the amendment or expansion of these law or regulation well our failure or inability to comply with them including result of acquired entity can result in regulatory penalty fine and legal liability increased cost additional remediation obligation suspension of production alteration suspension or termination of our manufacturing and assembly and test process including due to an inability to find afford or attain adequate substitute material equipment or process damage to our reputation and restriction on our

cost the failure or inability by or our customer and supplier to manage the use transportation emission discharge storage recycling or disposal of hazardous material can lead to increased cost or future liability environmental regulation such air quality and wastewater requirement may impede our ability to expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future environmental law and regulation sometimes require to acquire additional pollution abatement or remediation equipment modify product design cease the use of particular material or process remove or remediate hazardous substance or incur other expense or liability regulation in response to climate change could result in increased manufacturing cost associated with air pollution requirement for example semiconductor manufacturing us perfluorocarbon which have historically made up large portion of our direct greenhouse gas emission new or increased regulation limiting the use of such compound or other greenhouse gas emission could require to install additional abatement equipment purchase carbon offset and or alter where feasible our production process and source in addition new or increased climate change regulation could increase our energy cost for example result of carbon pricing impact on electrical utility we expand our manufacturing capacity part of our idm strategy the impact of future regulation could be magnified many new material that we are evaluating for use in our operation are subject to regulation under environmental law and regulation these restriction could harm our business and result of operation by increasing our expense or requiring to alter manufacturing and assembly and test process we have established and report on our initiative aspiration and goal related to corporate responsibility matter which expose to numerous risk wide range of stakeholder including government customer employee and investor are increasingly focused on and developing expectation regarding corporate responsibility matter such sustainability human capital management data privacy and cyber security and human right this attention ha resulted in variety of required and voluntary reporting regime that are not harmonized and continue to change for example government around the world have enacted or are contemplating legislation and regulation that may impact how we conduct and or report on our business by requiring the disclosure and tracking of certain greenhouse emission and other climate and biodiversity information and or cyber security or human capital matter related to our business third party group and non profit organization among others have also established standard for rating or framework for reporting on corporate responsibility initiative in response to the evolving stakeholder expectation and new or proposed standard customer and investor have formalized and expanded their own corporate responsibility goal and expectation that may influence how they ass invest in or utilize other business if we fail to set or achieve corporate responsibility initiative that meet our stakeholder expectation that could negatively impact our corporate responsibility initiative including our rise strategy and related goal could also expose to heightened scrutiny and numerous financial legal reputational operational compliance and other

sustainability is not guaranteed and is subject to numerous condition risk and expectation standard process and methodology that are early in their advancement and continue to evolve and science for which development is ongoing our rise strategy and related goal and expectation about cost to achieve those goal are based on current iteration of varied process and reporting framework well management current expectation regarding the availability efficiency development and cost of particular technology consumer trend and other assumption and change in those item could negatively impact our ability to achieve those goal or the cost of achieving them from time to time we may change expand or reduce the standard to which we report or goal that we seek to meet our failure or inability to achieve such goal or the perception by stakeholder of such failure or inability may negatively affect our reputation or result of operation even if achieved these matter may not result in some or all of the benefit anticipated at the time they were established the covid pandemic could materially adversely affect our financial condition and result of operation the covid pandemic ha previously adversely affected significant portion of our business and could have material adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operation authority in jurisdiction where we operate or in which our supplier customer or others operate have imposed and business and individual have implemented varied measure to try to manage or contain the virus or treat it impact such travel ban and restriction quarantine shelter in place stay at home and social distancing order shutdown and vaccine requirement these measure have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operation the operation and demand of our customer and those of our respective supplier and partner we have experienced and could in the future experience reduced workforce availability at some of our site

experience disruption in their operation and supply chain which can result in delayed reduced or cancelled order or collection risk and which may adversely affect our result of operation the pandemic ha caused to modify our business practice including with respect to flexible work and social distancing measure these and other measure introduce additional operational risk including cybersecurity risk and have affected the way we conduct our product development validation and qualification customer support and other activity which could have material adverse effect on our operation the pandemic ha also previously resulted in substantial economic uncertainty and volatility and disrupted historical pattern related to demand for our product and service that may impact our ability to accurately predict future demand trend or other matter that may impact our financial performance the degree to which covid impact our result will depend on future development and there is no certainty that measure we have taken or will take will be sufficient to mitigate the risk posed by the virus additional impact and risk may arise that we or our customer supplier and other partner are not aware of or able to respond to effectively and which may adversely affect the impact of covid can also exacerbate other risk discussed in these risk factor and throughout this report we operate globally and are subject to significant risk in many jurisdiction global or regional condition can harm our financial result we have manufacturing assembly and test sale and other operation in many country and some of our business activity are concentrated in one or more geographic area moreover sale outside the accounted for of our revenue for the fiscal year ended december with revenue from billing to china contributing of our total revenue result our operation and our financial result including our ability to execute our business strategy manufacture assemble and test design develop or sell product and the demand for our product are at time adversely affected by number of global and regional factor outside of our control adverse change in global or regional economic condition periodically occur including recession or slowing growth change or uncertainty in fiscal monetary or trade policy higher interest rate tighter credit inflation lower capital expenditure by business including on it infrastructure increase in unemployment and lower consumer confidence and spending adverse change in economic condition can significantly harm demand for our product and make it more challenging to forecast our operating result and make business decision including regarding prioritization of investment in our business an economic downturn or increased uncertainty may also lead to increased credit and collectability risk higher borrowing cost or reduced availability of capital and credit market reduced liquidity adverse impact on our supplier failure of counterparties including financial institution and insurer asset impairment and decline in the value of our financial instrument we can be adversely affected by other global and regional factor that periodically occur including geopolitical and security issue such armed conflict and civil or military unrest political instability human right concern and terrorist activity including for example geopolitical tension and conflict affecting israel where our mobileye business headquarters and certain of our fabrication facility are located natural disaster public health issue including pandemic and other catastrophic event inefficient infrastructure and other disruption such supply chain interruption material shortage or delay and large scale outage or unreliable provision of service from utility transportation data hosting or telecommunication provider formal or informal imposition of new or revised export import or doing business regulation including trade sanction tariff and change in the ability to obtain export license which could be changed without notice government restriction on or nationalization of our operation in any country or restriction on our ability to repatriate earnings from or distribute compensation or other fund in particular country adverse change relating to government grant tax credit or other government incentive including more favorable incentive provided to competitor differing employment practice and labor issue including restricted access to talent ineffective legal protection of our ip right in certain country local business and cultural factor that differ from our current standard and practice continuing uncertainty regarding social political immigration and tax and trade policy in the and abroad and fluctuation in the market value of our domestic and international investment and in the capital and credit market which can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration or loss interest rate change financial result political risk sovereign risk or other factor for example in in response to russia war with ukraine numerous country and organization have imposed financial and other sanction and export control against russia and belarus while business including intel have limited or suspended russian operation russia ha likewise imposed currency restriction and regulation and may further take retaliatory trade or other action including the nationalization of foreign business these and other action have exposed the company to the risk described herein and to additional uncertainty and risk regarding increase to supply commodity and other cost damage to our reputation and cyberattacks and may increase the likelihood or amplify the impact of other risk including those highlighted in these risk factor and throughout this report other key of contentswe are also subject to risk related to the cessation of dollar libor certain of our derivative and floating rate investment reference dollar libor and portion of our indebtedness bear interest at variable interest rate primarily based on dollar libor no new dollar libor based activity can be conducted after and dollar libor will be unavailable for use in our existing contract and financial instrument beyond june while reasonable alternative to libor have been introduced into market our transition from libor to alternative reference rate could result in an increase in our interest expense and or reduction in our interest income we are subject to risk related to trade policy and regulation trade policy and dispute at time result in increased tariff trade barrier and other protectionist measure which can increase our manufacturing cost make our product le competitive reduce demand for our product limit our ability to sell to certain customer limit our ability to procure component or raw material or impede or slow the movement of our good across border increasing protectionism and economic nationalism may lead to further change in trade policy and regulation domestic sourcing initiative or other formal and informal measure that could make it more difficult to sell our product in or restrict our access to some market in particular trade tension between the and china have led to increased tariff and trade restriction including tariff applicable to some of our product and have affected customer ordering pattern the ha imposed restriction on the export of regulated product and technology to certain chinese technology company including certain of our customer these restriction have reduced our sale and continuing or future restriction could adversely affect our financial performance result in reputational harm to or lead such company to develop or adopt technology that compete with our product it is difficult to predict what further trade related action government may take which may include trade restriction and additional or increased tariff and export control imposed on short notice and we may be unable to quickly and effectively react to or mitigate such action trade dispute and protectionist measure or continued uncertainty about such matter could result in declining consumer confidence and slowing economic growth or recession and could cause our customer to reduce cancel or alter the timing of their purchase with sustained geopolitical tension could lead to long term change in global trade and technology supply chain and decoupling of global trade network which could have material adverse effect on our business and growth prospect law and regulation can have negative impact on our business we are subject to law and regulation worldwide that differ among jurisdiction affecting our operation in area including but not limited to ip ownership and infringement tax import and export requirement anti corruption foreign exchange control and cash repatriation restriction data privacy and localization requirement competition advertising employment and labor product regulation environment health and safety requirement and consumer law compliance with such requirement can be onerous and expensive and may otherwise impact our business operation negatively for example unfavorable development with evolving law and regulation worldwide related to or autonomous driving technology and maas may limit global adoption impede our strategy or negatively impact our long term expectation for our investment in these area expanding privacy legislation and compliance cost of privacy related and data protection measure could adversely affect our customer and their product and service particularly in cloud internet of thing and ai application which could in turn reduce demand for our product used for those workload our policy control and procedure designed to help provide for compliance with applicable law can not provide assurance that our employee contractor supplier or agent will not violate such law or our policy violation of these law and regulation can result in fine criminal sanction against our officer or our employee prohibition on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation the technology industry is subject to intense medium political and regulatory scrutiny which can increase our exposure to government investigation legal action and penalty we are affected by fluctuation in currency exchange rate we are exposed to adverse well beneficial movement in currency exchange rate although most of our sale occur in dollar expense may be paid in local currency an increase in the value of the dollar can increase the real cost to our customer of our product in those market outside the where we sell in dollar and weakened dollar can increase the cost of expense such payroll utility tax and marketing expense well overseas capital expenditure we also conduct certain investing and financing activity in local currency our hedging program may not be effective to offset any or more than portion of the adverse impact of currency exchange rate movement therefore change in exchange rate can harm our result of operation and financial condition change in our effective tax rate may impact our net income number of factor can impact our effective tax rate which could reduce or increase our net income including change in the volume and mix of profit earned and location of asset across jurisdiction with varying tax rate the resolution of issue arising from tax audit including payment of interest and penalty change in the valuation of our deferred tax asset and liability and in deferred tax valuation allowance adjustment to income tax upon finalization of tax return increase in expense not deductible for tax purpose including impairment of goodwill change in available tax credit change in our ability to secure new or renew existing tax holiday and incentive change in federal state or foreign tax law or their interpretation including change in the to the taxation of manufacturing enterprise and of non income and expense and change resulting from the adoption by country of the organization for economic co operation and development recommendation or other legislative action other key of content change in accounting standard and our decision to repatriate non earnings for which we have not previously provided for local country withholding tax incurred upon repatriation catastrophic event can have material adverse effect on our operation and financial result our operation and business and those of our customer and supplier can be disrupted by natural disaster industrial accident public health issue cybersecurity incident interruption of service from utility transportation telecommunication or it system provider manufacturing equipment failure or other catastrophic event for example we have at time experienced disruption in our manufacturing process result of power outage improperly functioning equipment and disruption in supply of raw material or component including due to cybersecurity incident affecting our supplier our headquarters and many of our operation and facility are in location that are prone to earthquake and other natural disaster global climate change can result in certain natural disaster occurring more frequently or with greater intensity such drought wildfire storm sea level rise and flooding and could disrupt the availability of water necessary for the operation of our fabrication facility including our facility located in water sensitive region such arizona and israel in addition to the extent we are unable to successfully manage and conserve water resource our reputation could be harmed in recent year the west coast of the ha experienced significant wildfire including in oregon where we have major manufacturing facility and in california where we are headquartered the long term effect of climate change on the global economy and the technology industry in particular are unclear but could be severe catastrophic event could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver product to our customer receive production material from our supplier or perform critical function which could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery time and expenditure to resume operation while we maintain business recovery plan some of our system are not fully redundant and we can not be sure that our plan will fully protect from such disruption furthermore even if our operation are unaffected or recover quickly if our customer or supplier can not timely resume their own operation due to catastrophic event we may experience reduced or cancelled order or disruption to our supply chain that may adversely affect our result of operation we maintain program of insurance coverage for variety of property casualty and other risk the type and amount of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability cost and decision with respect to risk retention some of our policy have large deductible and broad exclusion in addition one or more of our insurance provider may be unable or unwilling to pay claim loss not covered by insurance may be large which could harm our result of operation and financial condition damage to our reputation can damage our business our reputation is critical factor in our relationship with customer employee government supplier and other stakeholder our failure to address or the appearance of our failure to address issue that give rise to reputational risk including those described throughout these risk factor could significantly harm our reputation and our brand our reputation can be impacted by catastrophic event incident involving unethical behavior or misconduct product quality security or safety issue allegation of legal noncompliance internal control failure corporate responsibility and governance issue data breach workplace safety incident environmental incident our response to climate change including our greenhouse gas emission level the use of our product for illegal or objectionable application including ai and machine learning application that present ethical regulatory or other issue marketing practice medium statement the conduct of our supplier or representative and other issue incident or statement that whether actual or perceived result in adverse publicity to the extent we fail to respond quickly and effectively to address corporate crisis the ensuing negative public reaction could significantly harm our reputation and our brand and could lead to increase in litigation claim and asserted damage or subject to regulatory action or restriction damage to our reputation could reduce demand for our product and adversely affect our business and operating environment it could reduce investor confidence in adversely affecting our stock price it may also limit our ability to be seen an employer of choice when competing for highly skilled employee moreover repairing our reputation and brand may be difficult time consuming and expensive we are subject to cybersecurity and privacy risk we face risk related to cybersecurity threat and incident we regularly face attempt by others to gain unauthorized access through the internet or to introduce malicious software to our it system individual or organization including malicious hacker state sponsored organization insider threat including employee and third party service provider or intruder into our physical facility at time attempt to gain unauthorized access and or corrupt the process used to design and manufacture our hardware product and our associated software and service due to the widespread use of our product we are frequent target of computer hacker and organization that intend to sabotage compromise take control of or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other process product and service we are also target of malicious attacker who attempt to gain access to our network or data center or those of our supplier customer partner or end user steal proprietary information related to our business product employee supplier and customer interrupt our system and service or those of our supplier customer or others or demand ransom to return control of such system and service such attempt are increasing in number and in technical sophistication and if successful expose and the affected party to risk of loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information or disruption of our business operation including our manufacturing operation our it infrastructure also includes product and service provided by third party and these provider can experience breach of their system and product or provide inadequate update or support which can impact the security of our system and our proprietary or confidential information in addition we are global company with operation and employee around the world we face risk related to the use or misuse inadvertent or otherwise of our it system by employee vendor and other individual with access to our system other key of contentsfrom time to time we encounter intrusion or unauthorized access to our network product service or infrastructure well those of third party who provide product and service to for example in the fourth quarter of our habana lab subsidiary network wa breached resulting in unauthorized third party access of certain confidential information in connection with suspected unsuccessful ransomware attack the breach wa confined to our subsidiary network and ha not had material impact on habana lab business we are also subject to risk associated with attack involving our supply chain such the compromise of it infrastructure management software provided by solarwinds corporation reported in the fourth quarter of during we have observed an increase in ransomware attack in our supply chain in december vulnerability named wa reported for the widely used java logging library apache we reviewed the use of this library within our software product portfolio and in our it environment but the step we have taken to mitigate the vulnerability may not be sufficient to mitigate all related risk to date cybersecurity incident have not resulted in material adverse impact to our business or operation but there can be no guarantee we will not experience such an impact such incident whether or not successful could result in our incurring significant cost related to for example rebuilding internal system writing down inventory value implementing additional threat protection measure providing modification to our product and service defending against litigation responding to regulatory inquiry or action paying damage providing customer with incentive to maintain the business relationship or taking other remedial step with respect to third party well reputational harm in addition these threat are constantly evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measure result of the covid pandemic remote work and remote access to our system ha increased significantly which also increase our cybersecurity attack surface we have also seen an increase in cyberattack volume frequency and sophistication driven by the global enablement of remote workforce we seek to detect and investigate unauthorized attempt and attack against our network product and service and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through change or update to our internal process and tool and change or update to our product and service however we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threat in some instance we our supplier our customer and the user of our product and service can be unaware of an incident or it magnitude and effect there is increasing regulation regarding response to cybersecurity incident including reporting to regulator which could subject to additional liability and reputational harm theft loss or misuse of personal data about our employee customer or other third party could increase our expense damage our reputation or result in legal or regulatory proceeding the theft loss or misuse of personal data collected used stored or transferred by to run our business including data stored with vendor or other third party could result in significantly increased business and security cost or cost related to defending legal claim we anticipate that our collection of such personal data will increase we enter into the maas market in our mobileye business and it may increase we enter into other new or adjacent business global privacy legislation enforcement and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating complex regulatory compliance environment cost to comply with and implement these privacy related and data protection measure could be significant and noncompliance could expose to significant monetary penalty damage to our reputation suspension of online service or site in certain country and even criminal sanction even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal state or international privacy related or data protection law and regulation could result in audit regulatory inquiry or proceeding against by governmental entity or other third party we are subject to ip risk and risk associated with litigation and regulatory proceeding we can not always protect our ip or enforce our ip right we regard our patent copyright trade secret and other ip right important to the success of our business we rely on ip law well confidentiality and licensing agreement with our customer employee technology development partner and others to protect our ip and ip right our ability to enforce these right is subject to general litigation risk well uncertainty to the enforceability of our ip right in various country we are not always able to obtain protection for our ip or enforce or protect our ip right enforcement is costly and time consuming and can divert management attention when we seek to enforce our right we may be subject to claim that our ip right are invalid not enforceable or licensed to an opposing party our assertion of ip right may result in another party seeking to assert claim against which could harm our business from time to time government adopt regulation and government or court render decision requiring compulsory licensing of ip right or government require product to meet standard that favor local company our inability to enforce our ip right under any of these circumstance can harm our competitive position and business in some case our ip right can offer inadequate protection for our innovation in addition the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secret and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our product result the value of our investment in product development and marketing could be reduced this risk is heightened competitor for technical talent increasingly seek to hire our employee our license with other company and participation in industry initiative at time allow competitor to use some of our patent right technology company often bilaterally license patent between each other to settle dispute or part of business agreement some of our competitor have in the past had and may in the future have license to some of our patent and under current case law some of the license can exhaust our patent right to licensed product sale under some circumstance our participation in industry standard organization or with other industry initiative at time requires to offer to license our patent to company that adopt industry standard specification depending on the rule of the organization government regulation or court decision we sometimes have to grant license to some of our patent for little or no cost and result we may be unable to enforce certain patent against others and the value of our ip right may be impaired other key of contentsthird party assert claim based on ip right against and our product which could harm our business we face claim based on ip right from individual company non practicing entity academic and research institution and other party including claim from those who have aggregated patent acquired from multiple source to form new larger portfolio to assert claim against and other company additionally large patent portfolio owner sometimes divest portion of their portfolio to more than one individual or company increasing the number of party who own ip right that were previously all held by single party we have seen an increase in patent assertion and lawsuit initiated by well funded non practicing entity including entity funded by investment firm and other third party in some instance these entity have filed multi jurisdiction litigation seeking large monetary damage and or injunction against these lawsuit can increase our cost of doing business impact our reputation or relationship with customer and could disrupt our operation if they succeed in blocking the trade of our product for example in the multi jurisdiction litigation brought against by vlsi jury in certain of the federal court case returned unfavorable verdict against of million in damage in november and approximately billion in damage in february both of which we expect to appeal or have appealed discussed in note commitment and contingency within the note to consolidated financial statement the patent litigation environment ha also become more challenging due to the emergence of venue adopting procedural and substantive rule that make them more favorable for patent asserter including the availability of injunctive relief for non practicing entity and the patent and trademark office reduction of inter partes patent review under the america invents act result we believe we are facing more hostile ip litigation environment we are typically engaged in number of dispute involving ip right claim that our product technology or process infringe the ip right of others regardless of their merit cause to incur large cost to respond to defend and resolve the claim and they divert the effort and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business and operation in addition we may face claim based on the alleged theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third party trade secret confidential information or end user data that we obtain in conducting our business any such incident and claim could severely disrupt our business and we could suffer loss including the cost of product recall and return and reputational harm furthermore we have agreed to indemnify customer for certain ip right claim against them ip right claim against our customer could also limit demand for our product or disrupt our customer business which could in turn adversely affect our result of operation result of ip right claim we could pay monetary damage payment to satisfy indemnification obligation royalty fine or penalty stop manufacturing using selling offering to sell or importing product or technology subject to claim need to develop other product or technology not subject to claim which could be time consuming or costly and or enter into settlement or license agreement which may not be available on commercially reasonable term and may be costly these ip right claim could harm our competitive position result in expense or require to impair our asset if we alter or stop production of affected item our revenue could be harmed we rely on access to third party ip which may not be available to on commercially reasonable term or at all many of our product are designed to include third party technology or implement industry standard which may require license from third party in addition from time to time third party notify that they believe we are using their ip there is no assurance that necessary license to such third party ip can be obtained on commercially reasonable term or at all or that our existing license to third party ip will continue to be available on commercially reasonable term or at all failure to obtain the right to use third party technology or to license ip on commercially reasonable term could preclude from selling certain product or otherwise have material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating result to the extent our product include software that contains or is derived from open source software we may be required to make the software source code publicly available and or license the software under open source licensing term we are subject to risk associated with litigation and regulatory matter from time to time we face legal claim or regulatory matter involving stockholder consumer competition commercial ip labor and employment compliance and other issue on global basis described in note commitment and contingency within the note to consolidated financial statement we are engaged in number of litigation and regulatory matter litigation and regulatory proceeding are inherently uncertain and adverse ruling excessive verdict or other event could occur including monetary damage fine penalty or injunction stopping from manufacturing or selling certain product engaging in certain business practice or requiring other remedy such compulsory licensing of patent an unfavorable outcome can result in material adverse impact on our business financial condition and result of operation regardless of the outcome litigation and regulatory proceeding can be costly time consuming disruptive to our operation harmful to our reputation and distracting to management other key of contentswe must attract retain and motivate key employee we believe that hiring and retaining qualified executive scientist engineer technical staff and sale representative are critical to our business the competition for highly skilled employee in our industry is intense competitor for technical talent increasingly seek to hire our employee and the increased availability of flexible hybrid or work from home arrangement ha both intensified and expanded competition in addition change in immigration policy may further limit the pool of available talent and impair our ability to recruit and hire technical and professional talent from time to time we have intensified our effort to recruit and retain talent such during and the first half of and these effort have increased our expense further we may not be successful in attracting retaining and motivating the workforce necessary to deliver on our strategy and we have been required to curtail our planned hiring or reduce our workforce to respond to business condition that differ from our expectation which can be disruptive compromise our ability to deliver on our strategy and workforce goal and impact our ability to recruit in the future change in employment related law applicable to our workforce practice may also result in increased expense and le flexibility in how we meet our changing workforce need to help attract retain and motivate qualified employee we use share based award such rsus and performance based cash incentive award sustained decline in our stock price or lower stock price performance relative to competitor have been reducing the retention value of our share based award which can impact the competitiveness of our compensation our employee hiring and retention also depend on our ability to build and maintain diverse and inclusive workplace culture and be viewed an employer of choice to the extent our compensation program and workplace culture are not viewed competitive or change in our workforce and related restructuring reduction in force or other initiative are not viewed favorably our ability to attract retain and motivate employee can be weakened which could harm our result of operation in addition significant or prolonged turnover may negatively impact our operation and culture well our ability to successfully maintain our process and procedure including due to the loss of historical technical and other expertise change in our management team can also disrupt our business for example we appointed new cfo in january and made several other change to our senior leadership during the past year the failure to successfully transition and assimilate key employee could adversely affect our result of operation to the extent we do not effectively hire onboard retain and motivate key employee our business can be harmed we are subject to risk associated with our strategic transaction our acquisition divestiture and other strategic transaction could fail to achieve our financial or strategic objective disrupt our ongoing business and adversely impact our result of operation strategic transaction are an important component of our financial capital allocation strategy we routinely evaluate opportunity and enter into agreement for possible acquisition divestiture and other strategic transaction including novel transaction such our joint investment with brookfield in the manufacturing expansion of our ocotillo campus and the divestiture of our nand memory business these transaction involve numerous risk including our inability to identify opportunity in timely manner or on term acceptable to failure of the transaction to advance our business strategy and failure of it anticipated benefit to materialize disruption of our ongoing operation and diversion of our management attention failure of partner to satisfy financial or other obligation on which we rely our inability to exercise sole decision making authority regarding project property or entity failure to complete transaction in timely manner if at all due to our inability to obtain required government or other approval at all or without materially burdensome condition mandated acquisition divestiture or disposal ip dispute or other litigation difficulty in obtaining financing on term acceptable to or other unforeseen factor our failure to realize satisfactory return on our investment potentially resulting in an impairment of goodwill and other asset and restructuring charge our inability to effectively enter new market segment through our strategic transaction or retain customer and partner of acquired business our inability to retain key personnel of acquired or majority owned business or our difficulty in integrating employee business system and technology or otherwise operating the acquired business control process and procedure of acquired or majority owned business that do not adequately ensure compliance with law and regulation and our failure to identify compliance issue or liability our inability to resolve impasse or dispute with partner including result of difference in our interest or goal our failure to identify or our underestimation of commitment liability and other risk associated with acquired business or asset majority owned business or novel transaction and the potential for our transaction to result in dilutive issuance of our equity security or significant additional debt any of these risk could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition or cash flow particularly in the case of large acquisition divestiture or partial divestiture or several concurrent strategic transaction moreover our resource are limited and our decision to pursue transaction ha opportunity cost accordingly if we pursue particular transaction we at time need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transaction or otherwise investing our resource in manner that could help achieve our financial or strategic objective where an existing investment doe not strategically align to our key priority we routinely evaluate opportunity for possible divestiture and other option we may not realize the anticipated benefit of divestiture due to risk that include unfavorable price and term other key of contentschanges in market condition or geopolitical condition affecting the region or industry in which we or counterparties operate change in applicable law failure to receive regulatory or governmental approval limitation or restriction due to regulatory or governmental approval litigation contractual term or other condition delay in closing lack of support by third party action by competitor adverse effect on our business relationship operating result or business due to the announcement and pendency of such transaction and continued financial obligation unanticipated liability or transition cost associated with such transaction in some case we are not able to divest investment on acceptable term or at all we invest in public and private company and do not always realize return on our investment we make investment in public and private company to further our strategic and financial objective and to support certain key business initiative these company can include early stage company still defining their strategic direction many of the instrument in which we invest are non marketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment and we are not always able to achieve return in timely fashion if at all our ability to realize return on our investment in private company if any is typically dependent on the company participating in liquidity event such public offering or acquisition to the extent any of the company in which we invest are not successful which at time includes bankruptcy we could recognize an impairment and or lose all or part of our investment we face risk related to our debt obligation our debt obligation could adversely affect our business and financial condition including our ability to implement our strategy we currently have billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured note outstanding in addition we have commercial paper program of up to billion and credit facility to backstop these program and otherwise provide access to committed capital of up to billion from time to time we may incur additional indebtedness refinance our existing debt and issue additional note or other debt security in the future at variety of interest rate maturity and term the semiconductor industry is cyclical business and our revenue cash flow and outlook often fluctuate in accordance with this cycle well prevailing macroeconomic condition our business strategy and other risk described in these risk factor these fluctuation together with our debt level and related debt service obligation could have the effect of among other thing reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic condition and increasing the risk of future downgrade in our credit rating that can potentially impact the value of our outstanding debt and increase our borrowing cost we may also be required to raise additional financing for working capital capital expenditure debt service obligation debt refinancing future acquisition or other general corporate purpose which will depend on among other factor our financial position and performance well prevailing market condition and other factor beyond our control consequently we may not be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on term acceptable to or at all which could adversely impact our ability to service to repay outstanding indebtedness it becomes due and could adversely impact our business financial condition and the cost of borrowing we are subject to sale related risk we face risk related to sale through distributor and other third party we sell significant portion of our product through third party such distributor value added resellers and channel partner collectively referred to distributor well oems and odms we depend on many distributor to help create end customer demand provide technical support and other value added service to customer fill customer order and stock our product at time we rely on one or more key distributor for product and material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributor or their failure to perform expected could reduce our revenue our ability to add or replace distributor for some of our product is limited in addition our distributor expertise in the determination and stocking of acceptable inventory level for some of our product is not always easily transferable to new distributor result end customer may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of distributor using third party for distribution expose to many risk including competitive pressure and concentration credit and compliance risk distributor and other third party sell product that compete with our product and we sometimes need to provide financial and other incentive to focus them on the sale of our product from time to time they face financial difficulty including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of account receivable and financial result violation of the foreign corrupt practice act or similar law by distributor or other third party intermediary could have material impact on our business failure to manage risk related to our use of distributor and other third party may reduce sale increase expense and weaken our competitive position from time to time our product are resold by third party in an unauthorized gray market our policy and procedure designed to keep our product away from the gray market may not be successful in achieving this objective gray market product can distort demand and pricing dynamic in our distribution channel and certain geography which at time adversely affect our revenue opportunity gray market activity is difficult to monitor and can make forecasting demand more challenging gray market product also sometimes include part that have been altered or damaged and our reputation may be harmed when these product fail or are found to be substandard we receive significant portion of our revenue from limited number of customer collectively our three largest customer accounted for of our net revenue in of our net revenue in and of our net revenue in we expect small number of customer will continue to account for significant portion of our revenue in the foreseeable future other key of contentsindustry trend such the increasing shift of data center workload to the public cloud have increased the significance and purchasing power of certain customer particularly cloud service provider in some of our data center focused business the cloud and cloud application represent new and increasingly demanding computing environment the further consolidation of computing workload in the cloud and consolidation among cloud service provider can heighten the competitive importance of factor such collaboration and customization with cloud service provider customer to optimize product for their environment optimization for cloud service and application product performance energy efficiency feature differentiation product quality reliability and factor affecting server uptime and product security and security feature our competitive position can be eroded to the extent we do not execute effectively across these factor we are operating in an increasingly competitive environment including serving cloud service provider customer and the competitive environment adversely affected our result in dcai in some cloud service provider customer have also internally developed and may continue to develop their own semiconductor including design customized for their specific computing workload in addition cloud service can be marketed to end user based on service level or feature rather than hardware specification or they can abstract hardware under layer of software which can make it more difficult to differentiate our product to customer and end user the shift of data center workload to the cloud ha also adversely affected and may continue to affect sale to enterprise and government market segment customer when end user have elected to migrate workload to the extent we differentiate our product through customization to meet cloud customer specification order change delay or cancellation may result in non recoverable cost the loss of key customer substantial reduction in sale to them or change in the timing of their order can lead to reduction in our revenue increase the volatility of our result and harm our result of operation and financial condition for more information about our customer including customer who accounted for greater than of our net consolidated revenue see note operating segment within the note to consolidated financial statement we face risk related to transaction with government entity we receive proceeds from domestic and foreign local regional and national government associated with grant incentive and sale of our product and service government demand and payment are often affected by public sector budgetary cycle and funding authorization including with respect to government contract congressional approval of appropriation government contract are subject to procurement law and regulation relating to the award administration and performance of those contract well oversight and penalty for violation for example certain agreement with the government are subject to special rule on accounting ip right expense review information handling security customer and or employee and failure or inability to comply with these rule could result in civil and criminal penalty and sanction including termination of contract fine and suspension or debarment from future business with the government we have fluctuation in our stock price and the amount and frequency of our stock repurchase our stock price can experience period of significant volatility for example in our stock price ranged from closing high of to closing low of change in stock price or volume can also occur for the semiconductor industry more broadly and may occur without regard to underlying company performance change in our stock price can be driven by variety of factor within or outside of our control including the risk described above in these risk factor well fluctuation in national and global market fluctuation in our operating result and projection announcement by or our competitor sentiment speculation valuation analysis or recommendation of stock analyst social medium and the press our credit rating change in holder of our stock significant litigation or regulatory action and other periodic event we are not obligated to make repurchase under our stock repurchase program the amount timing and execution of any share repurchase fluctuate based on factor that include prioritizing cash for other purpose such investing in our business including operational spending capital spending and acquisition returning cash to our stockholder dividend payment and any regulatory restriction our stock repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time moreover we can not guarantee that repurchase will enhance long term stockholder value we expect our future stock repurchase to be significantly below our level from the last few year for example in we not repurchase any share under our authorized stock repurchase program propertiesas of december our major facility consisted of square foot in million

performance obligation in accordance with contract term the revenue for combined performance obligation and standalone product sale is recognized at the time of product shipment from our facility or delivery to the customer location determined by the agreed upon shipping term we measure revenue based on the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for product or service variable consideration is estimated and reflected an adjustment to the transaction price we determine variable consideration which consists primarily of various sale price concession by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer based on historical analysis of customer purchase volume sale rebate earned by customer are offset against their receivable balance rebate earned by customer when they do not have outstanding receivable balance are recorded within other accrued liability we make payment to our customer through cooperative advertising program for marketing activity for some of our product we generally record the payment reduction in revenue in the period that the revenue is earned unless the payment is for distinct service which we record an expense when the marketing activity occur financial statementsnotes to consolidated financial of contentsinventorieswe compute inventory cost on first in first out basis our process and product development life cycle corresponds with substantive engineering milestone these engineering milestone are regularly and consistently applied in assessing the point at which our activity and associated cost change in nature from to cost of sale and when cost of sale can be capitalized inventory for product to be manufactured in high volume and sold to our customer under our standard warranty it must meet our rigorous technical quality specification this milestone is known prq we have identified prq the point at which the cost incurred to manufacture our product are included in the valuation of inventory single prq ha previously valued inventory up to million in the quarter the prq milestone wa achieved prior to prq cost that do not meet the criterion for are included in cost of sale in the period incurred the valuation of inventory includes determining which fixed production overhead cost can be included in inventory based on the normal capacity of our manufacturing and assembly and test facility we apply our historical loading compared to our total available capacity in statistical model to determine our normal capacity level if the factory loading are below the established normal capacity level portion of our fixed production overhead cost would not be included in the cost of inventory instead it would be recognized cost of sale in that period we refer to these cost excess capacity charge excess capacity charge were million in and insignificant in the comparative period presented charge in year prior to those presented have ranged up to billion taken in particular fiscal year such in connection with the economic recession inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value based upon assumption about future demand and market condition product specific fact and circumstance reviewed in the inventory valuation process include review of our customer base the stage of the product life cycle variation in market pricing and an assessment of selling price in relation to product cost lower of cost or net realizable value inventory reserve fluctuate we ramp new process technology with cost generally improving over time due to scale and improved yield additionally inventory valuation is impacted by cyclical change in market condition and the associated pricing environment the valuation of inventory also requires to estimate obsolete and excess inventory well inventory that is not of saleable quality we use demand forecast to develop our short term manufacturing plan to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decision for certain new product we have limited historical data when developing these demand forecast we compare the estimate of future demand to work in process and finished good inventory level to determine the amount if any of obsolete or excess inventory when our demand forecast for specific product is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly we write off amount considered to be excess inventory long lived assetsproperty plant and equipmentwe compute depreciation using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of asset we also capitalize interest on borrowing related to eligible capital expenditure capitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified asset and depreciated together with that asset cost at least annually we evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of our property plant and equipment considering factor such the process technology cadence between node transition change in machinery and equipment technology and re use of machinery and tool across each generation of process technology we make manufacturing process conversion and other factory planning decision we use assumption involving the use of management judgment regarding the remaining useful life of asset primarily process specific semiconductor manufacturing tool and building improvement when we determine that the useful life of asset are shorter or longer than we had originally estimated we adjust the rate of depreciation to reflect the asset revised useful life based on our latest evaluation effective january the estimated useful life of certain machinery and equipment in our wafer fabrication facility will increase from to year this change in estimate will be applied prospectively beginning in the first quarter of asset are categorized and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flow factor that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of business or product line in relation to expectation significant negative industry or economic trend and significant change or planned change in our use and fungibility of the asset if an asset grouping carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flow the asset grouping is considered to be impaired identified intangible assetswe amortize acquisition related intangible asset that are subject to amortization over their estimated useful life acquisition related in process asset represent the fair value of incomplete project that had not reached technological feasibility of the date of acquisition initially these are classified in process and are not subject to amortization once these project are completed the asset balance are transferred from in process to acquisition related developed technology and are subject to amortization from that point forward the asset balance relating to project that are abandoned after acquisition are impaired and expensed to financial statementsnotes to consolidated financial of contentswe perform periodic review of significant finite lived identified intangible asset to determine whether fact and circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable these review can be affected by various factor including external factor such industry and economic trend and internal factor such change in our business strategy and our forecast for specific product line periodically we also evaluate the estimated remaining useful life of purchased intangible asset and whether event or change in circumstance warrant revision to the remaining period of amortization we may adjust the period over which these asset are amortized to reflect the period in which they contribute to our cash flow goodwillour reporting unit are the same our operating segment we evaluate our reporting unit annually or when triggered such upon reorganization of our operating segment we perform an annual impairment assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if indicator of potential impairment exist the reporting unit carrying value used in an impairment assessment represents the assignment of various asset and liability excluding certain corporate asset and liability such cash investment and debt the impairment assessment may include both qualitative and quantitative factor to ass the likelihood of an impairment qualitative factor used include industry and market consideration overall financial performance and other relevant event and factor affecting the reporting unit we may also perform quantitative analysis to support the qualitative factor by applying sensitivity to assumption and input used in measuring reporting unit fair value our quantitative impairment assessment considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate reporting unit fair value significant estimate include market segment growth rate our assumed market segment share estimated gross margin operating expense and discount rate based on reporting unit weighted average cost of capital we test the reasonableness of the input and outcome of our discounted cash flow analysis against available market data these estimate change from year to year based on operating result market condition and other factor and could materially affect the determination of each reporting unit fair value and potential goodwill impairment for each reporting unit our quantitative assessment is sensitive to change in underlying estimate and assumption the most sensitive of which is the discount rate our annual qualitative assessment indicated that more detailed quantitative analysis wa necessary for one of our reporting unit no impairment wa required even when considering hypothetical increase in the discount rate of which would cause material decrease in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit government incentiveswe enter into government incentive arrangement with domestic and foreign local regional and national government which vary in size duration and condition these arrangement allow to maintain market comparable foothold across various geography we receive capital related and operating grant the benefit of which generally offset the cost of acquired capital and other expense and are primarily structured cash grant and non income tax incentive government grant including non income tax incentive are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and we will comply with the condition specified in the grant agreement we are eligible to receive these grant because we engage in qualifying capital investment research and development and other activity defined by the relevant government entity awarding the grant each grant agreement requires that we comply with certain condition including achievement of future operational target and committing to minimum level of capital investment we record capital related grant reduction to property plant and equipment net within our consolidated balance sheet and recognize reduction to depreciation and amortization expense over the useful life of the corresponding acquired asset we record operating grant reduction to expense in the same line item on the consolidated statement of income the expenditure for which the grant is intended to compensate capital related grant reduced gross property plant and equipment by billion of december of which million wa recognized in contra depreciation expense reduced cost of sale by million in majority of operating grant are recognized reduction to cost of sale benefiting operating income by million in capital related and operating grant receivables totaled million of december and substantial majority of the capital related and operating grant receivables were reflected within other long term asset on our consolidated balance sheet financial statementsnotes to consolidated financial of contentsfair valuewhen determining fair value we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact well assumption that market participant would use when pricing the asset or liability our financial asset are measured and recorded at fair value on recurring basis except for equity security measured using the measurement alternative equity method investment and grant receivable we ass fair value hierarchy level for our issued debt and fixed income investment portfolio based on the underlying instrument type the three level of input that may be used to measure fair value are level quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability we evaluate security specific market data when determining whether market is active level observable input other than level price such quoted price for similar asset or liability quoted price in le active market or model derived valuation all significant input used in our valuation such discounted cash flow are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability we use libor and sofr based yield curve overnight indexed swap curve currency spot and forward rate and credit rating significant input in our valuation level input also include non binding market consensus price well quoted price that were adjusted for security specific restriction when we use non binding market consensus price we corroborate them with quoted market price for similar instrument or compare them to output from internally developed pricing model such discounted cash flow model level unobservable input to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of asset or liability we monitor and review the input and result of these valuation model to help confirm that the fair value measurement are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset class level input also include non binding market consensus price or non binding broker quote that we were unable to corroborate with observable market data debt investmentsdebt investment include investment in corporate debt government debt and financial institution instrument debt investment with original maturity of approximately three month or le from the date of purchase are classified within cash and cash equivalent debt investment with original maturity at the date of purchase greater than approximately three month are classified short term investment they represent the investment of cash available for current operation for certain of our marketable debt investment we economically hedge market risk at inception with related derivative instrument or the marketable debt investment itself is used to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement these hedged investment are reported at fair value gain or loss on these investment arising from change in fair value due to interest rate and currency market fluctuation and credit market volatility largely offset by loss or gain on the related derivative instrument and balance sheet remeasurement are recorded in interest and other net our remaining unhedged marketable debt investment are reported at fair value with unrealized gain or loss net of tax recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss we determine the cost of the investment sold based on an average cost basis at the individual security level and record the interest income and realized gain or loss on the sale of these investment in interest and other net unhedged debt investment are subject to periodic impairment review for investment in an unrealized loss position we determine whether credit loss exists by considering information about the collectability of the instrument current market condition and reasonable and supportable forecast of economic condition we recognize an allowance for credit loss up to the amount of the unrealized loss when appropriate and write down the amortized cost basis of the investment if it is more likely than not we will be required or we intend to sell the investment before recovery of it amortized cost basis allowance for credit loss and write down are recognized in interest and other net and unrealized loss not related to credit loss are recognized in other comprehensive income loss equity investmentswe regularly invest in equity security of public and private company to promote business and strategic objective equity investment are measured and recorded follows marketable equity security are equity security with rdfv that are measured and recorded at fair value on recurring basis with change in fair value whether realized or unrealized recorded through the income statement non marketable equity security are equity security without rdfv that are measured and recorded using measurement alternative that measure the security at cost minus impairment if any plus or minus change resulting from qualifying observable price change equity method investment are equity security in investees we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence equity method investment are measured at cost minus impairment if any plus or minus our share of equity method investee income or loss our proportionate share of the income or loss from equity method investment is recognized on one quarter lag financial statementsnotes to consolidated financial of contentsrealized and unrealized gain and loss resulting from change in fair value or the sale of our equity investment are recorded in gain loss on equity investment net the carrying value of our non marketable equity security is adjusted for qualifying observable price change resulting from the issuance of similar or identical security in an orderly transaction by the same issuer determining whether an observed transaction is similar to security within our portfolio requires judgment based on the right and preference of the security recording upward and downward adjustment to the carrying value of our equity security result of observable price change requires quantitative assessment of the fair value of our security using various valuation methodology and involves the use of estimate non marketable equity security and equity method investment collectively referred to non marketable equity investment are also subject to periodic impairment review our quarterly impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factor that may have significant impact on the investee fair value qualitative factor considered include the investee financial condition and business outlook industry and sector performance market for technology operational and financing cash flow activity and other relevant event and factor affecting the investee when indicator of impairment exist we prepare quantitative assessment of the fair value of our non marketable equity investment using both the market and income approach which require judgment and the use of estimate including discount rate investee revenue and cost and comparable market data of private and public company among others non marketable equity security are tested for impairment using qualitative model similar to the model used for goodwill and property plant and equipment upon determining that an impairment may exist the security fair value is calculated and compared to it carrying value and an impairment is recognized immediately if the carrying value exceeds the fair value equity method investment are subject to periodic impairment review using the other than temporary impairment model which considers the severity and duration of decline in fair value below cost and our ability and intent to hold the investment for sufficient period of time to allow for recovery impairment of equity investment are recorded in gain loss on equity investment net derivative financial instrumentsour primary objective for holding derivative financial instrument is to manage currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk and to lesser extent equity market risk commodity price risk and credit risk we enter into master netting arrangement to mitigate credit risk in derivative transaction by permitting net settlement of transaction with the same counterparty we also enter into collateral security arrangement with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of

instrument derivative financial instrument loan receivable reverse repurchase agreement and trade receivables we generally place investment with high credit quality counterparties and by policy we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of that counterparty relative credit standing required per our investment policy substantially all of our investment in debt instrument are in investment grade instrument credit rating criterion for derivative instrument are similar to those for other investment we enter into master netting arrangement to mitigate

excluding money market fund invested in treasury and agency security and reverse repurchase agreement collateralized by treasury and agency security did not exceed billion to further reduce credit

long term liability for reverse repurchase agreement collateralized by other security we do not record the collateral an asset or liability unless the collateral is repledged majority of our trade receivables are derived from sale to oems and odms we also have account receivable derived from sale to industrial and communication equipment manufacturer in the computing and communication industry we believe the net account receivable balance from our three largest customer of december do not represent significant credit risk based on cash flow forecast balance sheet analysis and past collection experience we have adopted credit policy and standard intended to accommodate industry growth and inherent risk we believe credit risk are moderated by the financial stability of our major customer we ass credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis from this analysis we establish shipping and credit limit and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection device such obtaining parent guarantee standby letter of credit or credit insurance variable interest entitieswe have economic interest in entity that are vies if we conclude we are the primary beneficiary of the vie we are required to consolidate the entity in our financial statement to determine if we are the primary beneficiary we evaluate whether we have the power to direct the activity that most significantly impact the vie economic performance and the obligation to absorb loss or the right to receive benefit of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie our evaluation includes identification of significant activity and an assessment of our ability to direct those activity based on governance provision and arrangement to provide service to the vie periodically we ass whether any change in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination of whether the entity is vie and if so whether we are the primary beneficiary business combinationswe allocate the purchase price paid for asset acquired and liability assumed in connection with our acquisition based on their estimated fair value at the time of acquisition this allocation involves number of assumption estimate and judgment in determining the fair value of the following inventory property plant and equipment pre existing liability or legal claim and contingent consideration each may be applicable intangible asset including the valuation methodology estimation of future cash flow discount rate market segment growth rate and our assumed market segment share well the estimated useful life of intangible asset deferred tax asset and liability uncertain tax position and tax related valuation allowance which are initially estimated of the acquisition date and goodwill measured the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair value of the asset acquired and the liability assumed our assumption and estimate are based upon comparable market data and information obtained from our management and the management of the acquired company we allocate goodwill to the reporting unit of the business that are expected to benefit from the business combination employee equity incentive planswe use the straight line amortization method to recognize share based compensation expense over the service period

on the market price of our common stock when the award vest income taxeswe compute the provision for income tax using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax asset and liability are recognized for the expected future tax consequence of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax base of asset and liability and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we measure deferred tax asset and liability using the currently enacted tax rate that apply to taxable income in effect for the year in which those tax asset are expected to be realized or settled we ass the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax asset if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for tax by recording valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax asset recorded on our consolidated balance sheet recovery of portion of our deferred tax asset is affected by management plan with respect to holding or disposing of certain investment therefore such change could also affect our future provision for tax we recognize tax benefit from uncertain tax position only if based on the technical merit of the position it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the tax authority the tax benefit recognized in the financial statement from such position are measured based on the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement we recognize interest and penalty related to unrecognized tax benefit within the provision for benefit from tax on the consolidated statement of income we recognize the tax impact of including certain foreign earnings in taxable income period cost we have recognized deferred income tax for local country income and withholding tax that could be incurred on distribution of certain non earnings or for outside basis difference in our subsidiary because we do not plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings and basis difference remittance of non earnings are based on estimate and judgment of projected cash flow need well the

or claim an estimated loss from such contingency is recognized charge to income if it is probable that liability ha been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we evaluate development that could affect prior disclosure or previously accrued liability and make adjustment appropriate significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of loss related to such matter if one or more of these matter were resolved against for amount in excess of management estimate of loss our result of operation and financial condition
