natural gas natural gas liquid and lng price may have material adverse effect on our revenue operating income cash flow and liquidity and on the amount of dividend we elect to declare and pay on our common stock lower price may also limit the amount of reserve we can produce economically adversely affecting our ability to maintain our reserve replacement ratio and accelerating the reduction in our existing reserve level we continue production from upstream field significant reduction in crude oil bitumen natural gas natural gas liquid and lng price could also require to reduce our capital expenditure or impair the carrying value of our asset in the past two year we recognized several impairment which are described in note impairment and the aplng section of note investment loan and long term receivables in the note to consolidated financial statement if commodity price remain low relative to their historic level and we continue to optimize our investment and exercise capital

desired level of distribution to our stockholder any downward revision in our distribution could have material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock table of content we may need additional capital in the future and it may not be available on acceptable term we have historically relied primarily upon cash generated by our operation to fund our operation and strategy however we have also relied from time to time on access to the debt and equity capital market for funding there can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available in the future on acceptable term or at all our ability to obtain additional financing will be subject to number of factor including market condition our operating performance investor sentiment and our ability to incur additional debt in compliance with agreement governing our outstanding debt if we are unable to generate sufficient fund from operation or raise additional capital our growth could be impeded in addition we are regularly evaluated by the major rating agency based on number of factor including our financial strength and condition affecting the oil and gas industry generally due to the significant decline in price for crude oil bitumen natural gas natural gas liquid and lng and the expectation that these price could remain depressed in the near future the major rating agency conducted review of the oil and gas industry and downgraded our debt rating and those of several company operating in the industry any downgrade in our credit rating could increase the cost associated with any additional indebtedness we incur our business may be adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality of or default under our contract with third party with we do business the operation of our business requires to engage in transaction with numerous counterparties operating in variety of industry including other company operating in the oil and gas industry these counterparties may default on their obligation to result of operational failure or lack of liquidity or for other reason including bankruptcy market speculation about the credit quality of these counterparties or their ability to continue performing on their existing obligation may also exacerbate any operational difficulty or liquidity issue are experiencing particularly it relates to other company in the oil and gas industry result of the recent significant decline in commodity price any default by any of our counterparties may result in our inability to perform obligation under agreement we have made with third party or may otherwise adversely affect our business or result of operation in addition our right against any of our counterparties result of default may not be adequate to compensate for the resulting harm caused or may not be enforceable at all in some circumstance unless we successfully add to our existing proved reserve our future crude oil bitumen

the extent that we conduct successful exploration and development activity or through engineering study optimize production performance or identify additional or secondary recovery reserve our proved reserve will decline materially we produce crude oil bitumen natural gas and natural gas liquid accordingly to the extent we are unsuccessful in replacing the crude oil bitumen natural gas and natural gas liquid we produce with good prospect for future production our business will experience reduced cash flow and result of operation any cash conservation effort we may undertake result of commodity price decline may further limit our ability to replace depleted reserve the exploration and production of oil and gas is highly competitive industry the exploration and production of crude oil bitumen natural gas and natural gas liquid is highly competitive business we compete with private public and state owned company in all facet of the exploration and production business including to locate and

reserve could impair the quantity and value of those reserve our proved reserve information included in this annual report ha been derived from engineering estimate prepared by our personnel reserve estimation is process that involves estimating volume to be recovered from underground accumulation of crude oil bitumen natural gas and natural gas liquid that can not be directly measured result different petroleum engineer each using industry accepted geologic and engineering practice and scientific method may produce different estimate of reserve and future net cash flow based on the same available data any significant future price change could have material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved reserve any material change in the factor and assumption underlying our estimate of these item could result in material negative impact to the volume of reserve reported or could cause to incur impairment expense on property associated with the production of those reserve future reserve revision could also result from change in among other thing governmental regulation in addition to change in the quantity and value of our proved reserve the amount of crude oil bitumen natural gas and natural gas liquid that can be obtained from any proved reserve may ultimately be different from those estimated prior to extraction we expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditure and operating cost result of our compliance with existing and future environmental law and regulation likewise future environmental law and regulation such limitation on greenhouse gas emission may impact or limit our current business plan and reduce demand for our product our business are subject to numerous law and regulation relating to the protection of the environment these law and regulation continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our operation with respect to among other thing the discharge of pollutant into the environment emission into the

future period could be materially adversely affected although our business operation are designed and operated to accommodate expected climatic condition to the extent there are significant change in the earth climate such more severe or frequent weather condition in the market we serve or the area where our asset reside we could incur increased expense our operation could be materially impacted and demand for our product could fall demand for our product may also be adversely affected by conservation plan and effort undertaken in response to global climate change including plan developed in connection with the paris climate conference in december many government also provide or may in the future provide tax advantage and other subsidy to support the use and development of alternative energy technology our operation and the demand for our product could be materially impacted by the development and adoption of these technology table of content domestic and worldwide political and economic development could damage our operation and materially reduce our profitability and cash flow action of the state local and foreign government through tax and other legislation executive order and commercial restriction could reduce our operating profitability both in the united state and abroad in certain location government have imposed or proposed restriction on our operation special tax or tax assessment and payment transparency regulation that could require to disclose competitively sensitive information or might cause to violate non disclosure law of other country federal state and local legislative and regulatory agency initiative regarding the hydraulic fracturing process could result in operating restriction or delay in the completion of our oil and gas well the government can also prevent or restrict from business in foreign country these restriction and those of foreign government have in the past limited our ability to operate in or gain access to opportunity in various country action by host government have affected operation significantly in the past such the expropriation of our oil asset by the venezuelan government and may continue to do so in the future change in domestic and international regulation may affect our ability to obtain or maintain permit including those necessary for drilling and development of well or for construction of lng terminal or regasification facility in various location local political and economic factor in international market could have material adverse effect on approximately percent of our hydrocarbon production wa derived from production outside the united state in and percent of our proved reserve of december wa located outside the united state we are subject to risk associated with operation in international market including change in foreign governmental policy relating to crude oil natural gas bitumen natural gas liquid or lng pricing and taxation other political economic or diplomatic development changing political condition and international monetary fluctuation in particular some country where we operate lack well developed legal system or have not adopted clear legal and regulatory framework for oil and gas exploration and production this lack of legal certainty expose our operation to increased risk including increased difficulty in enforcing our agreement in those jurisdiction and increased risk of adverse action by local government authority such expropriation change in governmental regulation may impose price control and limitation on production of crude oil bitumen natural gas and natural gas liquid our operation are subject to extensive governmental regulation from time to time regulatory agency have imposed price control and limitation on production by restricting the rate of flow of crude oil bitumen natural gas and natural gas liquid well below actual production capacity legal requirement are frequently changed and subject to interpretation we can not predict the effect of these requirement our investment in joint venture decrease our ability to manage risk we conduct many of our operation through joint venture in which we may share control with our joint venture partner there is risk our joint venture participant may at any time have economic business or legal interest or goal that are inconsistent with those of the joint venture or or our joint venture partner may be unable to meet their economic or other obligation and we may be required to fulfill those obligation alone failure by or an entity in which we have joint venture

diverse portfolio primarily includes resource rich north american unconventional asset and oil sand asset in canada lower risk conventional asset in north america europe asia and australia several liquefied natural gas lng development and an inventory of global conventional and unconventional exploration prospect at december we employed approximately people worldwide and had total asset of billion our stock is listed on the new york stock exchange under the symbol cop overview the energy landscape remained challenged throughout global production oversupply caused continued weakness in commodity price in following year of weak price in ongoing uncertainty around the timing and trajectory of price recovery coupled with tightening credit capacity across the industry caused to take action early in the year to mitigate the impact of possible prolonged weak price we reduced our quarterly dividend by percent to per share issued billion of long term debt obtained billion three year term loan reduced capital expenditure and production and operating expense and further streamlined our portfolio our capital expenditure in were billion percent reduction compared with and percent reduction compared with production and operating expense in were billion down percent compared with and down percent compared with we also progressed our effort to high grade our portfolio in we

interest in three exploration block offshore senegal the full year production impact of completed disposition wa thousand barrel of oil equivalent per day mboed table of content during we expanded our value proposition to position the company for long term success in light of our view that commodity price specifically oil price are likely to remain lower and be more volatile in the future our value proposition principle namely to maintain strong balance sheet grow our dividend and pursue disciplined growth remain essentially unchanged however we took step to improve our competitiveness and resilience by establishing clear priority for allocating future cash flow in order these priority are invest capital at level that maintains flat production volume and pay our existing dividend grow our existing dividend reduce debt to level we believe is sufficient to maintain strong investment grade rating through price cycle repurchase share and invest capital to grow absolute production we outlined to operating plan that achieves these priority at brent price at or above per barrel with asset sale of billion to billion we believe we have taken prudent action to position the company for success in an environment of price uncertainty and ongoing volatility while accomplishing significant milestone in challenged business environment throughout key operating and financial summary significant item during included the following achieved full year production excluding libya of mboed percent production growth adjusted for downtime and disposition capital expenditure of billion more than percent reduction compared with reduced production and operating expense by percent year over year achieved project startup at aplng train in australia foster creek phase and christina lake phase in canada alder in europe malikai in malaysia and bohai wellhead platform in china significant discovery at willow prospect in alaska generated proceeds of billion from asset disposition announced preliminary year end proved reserve of billion boe initiated billion share buyback program in mid november business environment global oil market condition in were challenging the excess of supply relative to global demand led to another year of global inventory build global oil price experienced elevated level of volatility throughout with first quarter brent crude oil price reaching year quarterly average low of per barrel price recovered slightly in the second and third quarter of production growth slowed while demand continued to increase in the fourth quarter price continued to trend higher with brent crude oil averaging per barrel opec member and key non opec producer agreed to cut production in the energy industry ha periodically experienced this type of extreme volatility due to fluctuating supply and demand condition commodity price are the most significant factor impacting our profitability and related reinvestment of operating cash flow into our business among other dynamic that could influence world energy market and commodity price are global economic health supply disruption or fear thereof caused by civil unrest or military conflict action taken by opec environmental law tax regulation governmental policy and weather related disruption north america energy landscape ha been transformed from resource scarcity to an abundance of supply primarily due to advance in technology responsible for the rapid growth of tight oil production successful exploration and rising production from the canadian oil sand our strategy is to create value through price cycle by delivering on the financial and operational priority that underpin our value proposition table of content financial priority the financial priority we believe will drive our success through the price cycle include control cost and expense controlling operating and overhead cost without compromising safety and environmental stewardship is high priority we monitor these cost using various methodology that are reported to senior management monthly on both an absolute dollar basis and per unit basis managing operating and overhead cost is critical to maintaining competitive position in our industry particularly in low commodity price environment the ability to control our operating and overhead cost impact our ability to deliver strong cash from operation maintain strong balance sheet we believe financial strength is critical in cyclical business such in early ongoing uncertainty around the timing of price recovery coupled with tightening credit capacity across the industry caused to take action to preserve our balance sheet strength and mitigate the impact of possible weak price in and during the first quarter of we reduced our quarterly dividend and issued additional debt to secure liquidity realized commodity price improved subsequent to the first quarter of and we paid down approximately billion of debt during the second half of the year in november we announced our plan to reduce debt to billion by year end we expect to retire outstanding debt it matures and exercise flexibility in paying down our term loan which is due in return capital to shareholder in we paid dividend on our common stock of billion we believe in delivering value to our shareholder through the price cycle result we have set priority to increase our dividend rate annually and purchase up to billion of our common stock over the next three year we began repurchasing share in november and in january we announced percent increase to our quarterly dividend from per share to per share focus on financial return this is core aspect of our value proposition our goal is to achieve strong financial return by controlling our cost high grading our portfolio shifting our production mix and exercising capital discipline operational priority the operational priority we must manage well to be successful include maintain capital discipline we participate in commodity price driven and capital intensive industry with varying lead time from when an investment decision is made to the time an asset is operational and generates cash flow result we must invest significant capital dollar to explore for new oil and gas field develop newly discovered field maintain existing field and construct pipeline and lng facility given our view of greater price volatility we have shifted our capital allocation to focus on value preserving shorter cycle time and low cost of supply unconventional program in our resource base our cash allocation priority call for the investment of sufficient capital to maintain production and pay the existing dividend additional allocation of capital toward absolute growth will be dependent on satisfaction of other financial priority we use disciplined approach focused on value maximization to set our capital plan in november we announced capital budget of billion optimize our portfolio we continue to optimize our asset portfolio by focusing on low cost of supply asset which strategically fit our development plan in the third quarter of we announced plan to reduce future capital spending in our deepwater exploration program subsequently in we sold our interest in several exploration area including offshore senegal and terminated our final gulf of mexico deepwater drillship contract additionally during the year we sold our percent working interest in the offshore south natuna sea block production sharing contract psc in indonesia and our percent interest in an exploration license offshore newfoundland we generated approximately billion in proceeds from non core asset disposition in table of content in november we announced our plan to divest between billion and billion of asset primarily associated with north american natural gas over the next two year proceeds from the sale of asset will be directed toward the achievement of our financial priority we will continue to evaluate our asset to determine whether they fit our strategic direction and will optimize the portfolio necessary directing our capital investment to area that align with our objective maintain

pursue improved health safety and environment hse and operational performance add to our proved reserve base we primarily add to our proved reserve base in two way successful exploration exploitation and development of new and existing field application of new technology and process to improve recovery from existing field proved reserve estimate require economic production based on historical month first of month average price and current cost therefore our proved reserve generally decrease price decline and increase price rise additionally we continue cash conservation effort our reserve replacement effort could be delayed thus limiting our ability to replace depleted reserve low commodity price and reduced capital expenditure in adversely affected our reported year end proved reserve in our reserve replacement wa negative percent in the five year ended december our reserve replacement wa percent we expect our proved reserve to increase if price rise access to additional resource may become increasingly difficult commodity price can make project uneconomic or unattractive in addition prohibition of direct investment in some nation national fiscal term political instability competition from national oil company and lack of access to high potential area due to environmental or other regulation may negatively impact our ability to increase our reserve base such the timing and level at which we add to our reserve base may or may not allow to replace our production over subsequent year apply technical capability we leverage our knowledge and technology to create value and safely deliver on our plan technical strength is part of our heritage and we are evolving our technical approach to optimally apply best practice companywide we continue to evaluate potential solution to leverage knowledge of technological success across our operation such innovation enable to economically convert additional resource to reserve achieve greater operating efficiency and reduce our environmental impact develop and retain talented work force we strive to attract train develop and retain individual with the knowledge and skill to implement our business strategy and who support our value and ethic to this end we offer university internship across multiple discipline to attract the best talent and needed recruit experienced hire to maintain broad range of skill and experience we promote continued learning development and technical training through structured development program designed to enhance the technical and functional skill of our employee table of

in the fourth quarter of similarly wti crude oil price increased percent from per barrel in the fourth quarter of to per barrel in the same period of despite the fourth quarter increase crude oil

compared with per boe in the reduction in the price reflects lower average realized price across all commodity in recent year the use of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling in tight oil formation ha led to increased industry actual and forecasted crude oil and natural gas production in the united state although providing significant short and long term growth opportunity for our company the increased abundance of crude oil and natural gas due to development of tight oil play could also have adverse financial implication to including an extended period of low commodity price production curtailment delay of plan to develop area such unconventional field or alaska north slope natural gas field and underutilization of lng regasification facility should one or more of these event occur our revenue would be reduced and additional asset impairment might be possible impairment mentioned above we participate in capital intensive industry at time our property plant and

of content environmental we are subject to the same numerous international federal state and local environmental law and regulation other company in our industry the most significant of these environmental law and regulation include among others the federal clean air act which governs air emission federal clean water act which governs discharge to water body european union regulation for registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemical reach federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla which imposes liability on generator transporter and arranger of hazardous substance at site where hazardous substance release have occurred or are threatening to occur federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra which governs the treatment storage and disposal of solid waste federal oil pollution act of under which owner and operator of onshore facility and pipeline lessee or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located and owner and operator of vessel are liable for removal cost and damage that result from discharge of oil into navigable water of the united state federal emergency planning and community right to know act epcra which requires facility to report toxic chemical inventory with local emergency planning committee and response department federal safe drinking water act which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection well department of the interior regulation which relate to offshore oil and gas operation in water and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operation well potential liability for pollution damage european union trading directive resulting in european emission trading scheme these law and their implementing regulation set limit on emission and in the case of discharge to water establish water quality limit they also in most case require permit in association with new or modified operation these permit can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process which can be expensive and time consuming in addition there can be delay associated with notice and comment period and the agency processing of the application many of the delay associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant many state and foreign country where we operate also have or are developing similar environmental law and regulation governing these same type of activity while similar in some case these regulation may impose additional or more stringent requirement that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting product across state and international border the ultimate financial impact arising from environmental law and regulation is neither clearly known easily determinable new standard such air emission standard water quality standard and stricter fuel regulation continue to evolve however environmental law and regulation including those that may arise to address concern about global climate change are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operation in the united state and in other country in which we operate notable area of potential impact include air emission compliance and remediation obligation in the united state and canada an example is the use of hydraulic fracturing an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formation range of local state federal or national law and regulation currently govern hydraulic fracturing operation with hydraulic fracturing currently prohibited in some jurisdiction table of content although hydraulic fracturing ha been conducted for many decade number of new law regulation and permitting requirement are under consideration by the environmental protection agency epa the department of the interior and others which could result in increased cost operating restriction operational delay and or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resource governmental restriction on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall profitability or viability of certain of our oil and natural gas investment we have adopted operating principle that incorporate established industry standard designed to meet or exceed government requirement our practice continually evolve technology improves and regulation change we also are subject to certain law and regulation relating to environmental remediation obligation associated with current and past operation such law and regulation include cercla and rcra and their state equivalent longer term expenditure are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly we occasionally receive request for information or notice of potential liability from the epa and state environmental agency alleging we are potentially responsible party under cercla or an equivalent state statute on occasion we also have been made party to cost recovery litigation by those agency or by private party these request notice and lawsuit assert potential liability for remediation cost at various site that typically are not owned by but allegedly contain waste attributable to our past operation of december there were site around the united state in which we were identified potentially responsible party under cercla and comparable state law for most superfund site our potential liability will be significantly le than the total site remediation cost because the percentage of waste attributable to versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible party is relatively low although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal site and frequently so for state site other potentially responsible party at site where we are party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligation and where they have not or where potentially responsible party could not be located our share of liability ha not increased materially many of the site at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the epa or the state agency concerned prior to actual cleanup those potentially responsible normally ass site condition apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation in some instance we may have no liability or attain settlement of liability actual cleanup cost generally occur after the party obtain epa or equivalent state agency approval there are relatively site where we are major participant and given the timing and amount of anticipated expenditure neither the cost of remediation at those site nor such cost at all cercla site in the aggregate is expected to have material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition expensed environmental cost were million in and are expected to be about million per year in and capitalized environmental cost were million in and are expected to be about million per year in and accrued liability for remediation activity are not reduced for potential recovery from insurer or other third party and are not discounted except those assumed in purchase business combination which we do record on discounted basis many of these liability result from cercla rcra and similar state or international law that require to undertake certain investigative and remedial activity at site where we conduct or conducted operation or at site where conocophillips generated waste wa disposed the accrual also includes number of site we identified that may require environmental remediation but which are not currently the subject of cercla rcra or other agency enforcement activity if applicable we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third party recovery in the future we may incur significant cost under both cercla and rcra table of content remediation activity vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site depending on the mix of unique site characteristic evolving remediation technology diverse regulatory agency and enforcement policy and the presence or absence of potentially liable third party therefore it is difficult to develop reasonable estimate of future site remediation cost at december our balance sheet included total accrued environmental cost of million compared with million at december for remediation activity in the and canada we expect to incur substantial amount of these expenditure within the next year notwithstanding any of the foregoing and with other company engaged in similar business environmental cost and liability are inherent concern in our operation and product and there can be no assurance that material cost and liability will not be incurred however we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our result of operation or financial position result of compliance with current environmental law and regulation climate change there ha been broad range of proposed or promulgated state national and international law focusing on greenhouse gas ghg reduction these proposed or promulgated law apply or could apply in country where we have interest or may have interest in the future law in this field continue to evolve and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either timetable for implementation or our future compliance cost relating to implementation such law if enacted could have material impact on our result of operation and financial condition example of legislation or precursor for possible regulation that do or could affect our operation include european emission trading scheme ets the program through which many of the european union eu member state are implementing the kyoto protocol our cost of compliance with the eu ets in wa approximately million net share before tax the alberta specified gas emitter regulation require any existing facility with emission equal to or greater than metric tonne of carbon dioxide or equivalent per year to reduce it net emission intensity from it baseline the reduction requirement increased from percent in to percent in and will increase again to percent in we also incur carbon tax for emission from fossil fuel combustion in our british columbia operation the total cost of compliance with these regulation in wa approximately million the supreme court decision in massachusetts epa ct confirming that the epa ha the authority to regulate carbon dioxide an air pollutant under the federal clean air act the epa announcement on march published interpretation of regulation that determine pollutant covered by clean air act permitting program fed reg april and the epa and department of transportation joint promulgation of final rule on april that trigger regulation of ghgs under the clean air act may trigger more climate based claim for damage and may result in longer agency review time for development project the epa announcement on january outlining series of step it plan to take to address methane and smog forming volatile organic compound emission from the oil and gas industry the former administration established goal of reducing the level in methane emission from the oil and gas industry by to percent by carbon tax in certain jurisdiction our cost of compliance with norwegian carbon tax legislation in wa approximately million net share before tax the agreement reached in paris in december at the conference of the party to the united nation framework on climate change setting new process for achieving global emission reduction in the united state some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal and state level with respect to ghg emission such regulation could take any of several form that may result in the creation of additional cost in the form of tax the restriction of output investment of capital to maintain compliance with law and regulation or required acquisition or trading of emission allowance table of content we are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operation compliance with change in law and regulation that create ghg emission trading scheme or ghg reduction policy could significantly increase our cost reduce demand for fossil energy derived product impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation such law and regulation could also increase demand for le carbon intensive energy source including natural gas the ultimate impact on our financial performance either positive or negative will depend on number of factor including but not limited to whether and to extent legislation or regulation is enacted the timing of the introduction of such legislation or regulation the nature of the legislation such cap and trade system or tax on emission or regulation the price placed on ghg

increased compliance cost are ultimately reflected in the price of our product and service the company ha responded by putting in place corporate climate change action plan together with individual business unit climate change management plan in order to undertake action in four major area equipping the company for low emission world for example by integrating ghg forecasting and reporting into company procedure utilizing ghg pricing in planning economics developing system to handle ghg market transaction reducing ghg emission in the company reduced or avoided ghg emission by approximately metric tonne by carrying out range of program across number of business unit evaluating business opportunity such the creation of offset and allowance the use of low carbon energy and the development of low carbon technology engaging externally the company is sponsor of mit joint program on the science and policy of global change constructively engages in the development of climate change legislation and regulation and discloses our progress and performance through the carbon disclosure project and the dow jones sustainability index the company us an estimated market cost of ghg emission in the range of to per tonne depending on the timing and country or region to evaluate future opportunity other we have deferred tax asset related to certain accrued liability loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards valuation allowance have been established to reduce these deferred tax asset to an amount that will more likely than not be realized based on our historical taxable income our expectation for the future and available tax planning strategy management expects the net deferred tax asset will be realized offset to reversing deferred tax liability and offset to the tax consequence of future taxable income table of content new accounting standard in february the financial accounting standard board fasb issued accounting standard update asu no lease asu no which establishes comprehensive accounting and financial reporting requirement for leasing arrangement this asu supersedes the existing requirement in fasb accounting standard codification asc topic lease and requires lessee to recognize substantially all lease asset and lease liability on the balance sheet the provision of asu no also modify the definition of lease and outline requirement for recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of leasing arrangement by both lessee and lessor the asu is effective for interim and annual period beginning after december and early adoption of the standard is permitted entity are required to adopt the asu using modified retrospective approach subject to certain optional practical expedient and apply the provision of asu no to leasing arrangement existing at or entered into after the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statement while we continue to evaluate the asu we expect the adoption of the asu to have material impact on our consolidated financial statement and disclosure for additional information see note new accounting standard in the note to consolidated financial statement critical accounting estimate the preparation of financial statement in conformity with generally accepted accounting principle requires management to select appropriate accounting policy and to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense see note accounting policy in the note to consolidated financial statement for description of our major accounting policy certain of these accounting policy involve judgment and uncertainty to such an extent there is reasonable likelihood materially different amount would have been reported under different condition or if different assumption had been used these critical accounting estimate are discussed with the audit and finance committee of the board of director at least annually we believe the following discussion of critical accounting estimate along with the discussion of contingency and of deferred tax asset valuation allowance in this report address all important accounting area where the nature of accounting estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matter or the susceptibility of such matter to change oil and gas accounting accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rule unique to the oil and gas industry the acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information prior to the discovery of proved reserve is expensed incurred similar to accounting for research and development cost however leasehold acquisition cost and exploratory well cost are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserve have been discovered on the prospect property acquisition cost for individually significant leasehold management periodically ass for impairment based on exploration and drilling effort to date for relatively small individual leasehold acquisition cost management exercise judgment and determines percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserve and pool that leasehold information with others in the geographic area for prospect in area with limited or no previous exploratory drilling the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high this judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense this judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leasehold and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively at year end the book value of the pool of property acquisition cost that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above described periodic leasehold impairment calculation wa million and the accumulated impairment reserve wa million table of content the weighted average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure wa approximately percent and the weighted average amortization period wa approximately two year if that judgmental percentage were to be raised by percent across all calculation before tax leasehold impairment expense in would increase by approximately million at year end the remaining million of net capitalized unproved property cost consisted primarily of individually significant leasehold mineral right held in perpetuity by title ownership exploratory well currently being drilled suspended exploratory well and capitalized interest of this amount approximately billion is concentrated in nine major development area the majority of which are not expected to move to proved property in management periodically ass individually significant leasehold for impairment based on the result of exploration and drilling effort and the outlook for commercialization exploratory cost for exploratory well drilling cost are temporarily capitalized or suspended on the balance sheet pending determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserve have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify development if exploratory well encounter potentially economic quantity of oil and gas the well cost remain capitalized on the balance sheet long sufficient progress assessing the reserve and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made the accounting notion of sufficient progress is judgmental area but the accounting rule do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well cost on the expectation future market condition will improve or new technology will be found that would make the development economically profitable often the ability to move into the development phase and record proved reserve is dependent on obtaining permit and government or co venturer approval the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control exploratory well cost remain suspended long we are actively pursuing such approval and permit and believe they will be obtained once all required approval and permit have been obtained the project are moved into the development phase and the oil and gas reserve are designated proved reserve for complex exploratory discovery it is not unusual to have exploratory well remain suspended on the balance sheet for several year while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co venturer approval of development plan or seek environmental permitting once determination is made the well not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantity the well cost are expensed dry hole and reported in exploration expense management review suspended well balance quarterly continuously monitor the result of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work and expense the suspended well cost dry hole when it determines the potential field doe not warrant further investment in the near term criterion utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristic and hydrocarbon property expected development cost ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserve fiscal term regulation or contract negotiation and our expected return on investment at year end total suspended well cost were million compared with million at year end for additional information on suspended well including an aging analysis see note suspended well and other exploration expense in the note to consolidated financial statement proved reserve engineering estimate of the quantity of proved reserve are inherently imprecise and represent approximate amount because of the judgment involved in developing such information reserve estimate are based on geological and engineering assessment of in place hydrocarbon volume the production plan historical extraction recovery and processing yield factor installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limit the reliability of these estimate at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbon despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimate accounting rule require disclosure of proved reserve estimate due to the importance of these estimate to better understand the perceived value and future cash flow of company operation there are several authoritative guideline regarding the engineering criterion that must be met before estimated reserve can be designated proved table of content our geosciences and reservoir engineering organization ha policy and procedure in place consistent with these authoritative guideline we have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserve held by consolidated company well our share of equity affiliate proved reserve estimate are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant change occur and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field also required by current authoritative guideline the estimated future date when an asset will be permanently shut down for economic reason is based on month average price and current cost this estimated date when production will end affect the amount of estimated reserve therefore price and cost level change from year to year the estimate of proved reserve also change generally our proved reserve decrease price decline and increase price rise our proved reserve include estimated quantity related to production sharing contract reported under the economic interest method well variable royalty regime and are subject to fluctuation in commodity price recoverable operating expense and capital cost if cost remain stable reserve quantity attributable to recovery of cost will change inversely to change in commodity price we would expect reserve from these contract to decrease when product price rise and increase when price decline the estimation of proved developed reserve also is important to the income statement because the proved developed reserve estimate for field serf the denominator in the unit of production calculation of the dd of the capitalized cost for that asset at year end the net book value of productive property plant and equipment pp subject to unit of production calculation wa approximately billion and the dd recorded on these asset in wa approximately billion the estimated proved developed reserve for our consolidated operation were billion boe at the end of and billion boe at the end of if the estimate of proved reserve used in the unit of production calculation had been lower by percent across all calculation before tax dd in would have increased by an estimated million impairment long lived asset used in operation are assessed for impairment whenever change in fact and circumstance indicate possible significant deterioration in future cash flow expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following update to corporate planning assumption if there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered the asset is monitored by management through an established process where change to significant assumption such price volume and future development plan are reviewed if upon review the sum of the undiscounted before tax cash flow is le than the carrying value of the asset group the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value individual asset are grouped for impairment purpose based on judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flow that are largely independent of the cash flow of other group of asset generally on field by field basis for exploration and production asset because there usually is lack of quoted market price for long lived asset the fair value of impaired asset is typically determined based on the present value of expected future cash flow using discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participant or based on multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transaction of similar asset where possible the expected future cash flow used for impairment review and related fair value calculation are based on judgmental assessment of future production volume commodity price operating cost and capital decision considering all available information at the date of review differing assumption could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment in any period see note impairment in the note to consolidated financial statement for additional information investment in nonconsolidated entity accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence of loss in value and annually following update to corporate planning assumption such evidence of loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount or current fair value le than the investment carrying amount when it is determined such loss in value is other than temporary an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment carrying value and it estimated fair value table of content when determining whether decline in value is other than temporary management considers factor such the length of time and extent of the decline the investee financial condition and near term prospect and our ability and intention to retain our investment for period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment since quoted market price are usually not available the fair value is typically based on the present value of expected future cash flow using discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participant plus market analysis of comparable asset owned by the investee if appropriate differing assumption could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period see the aplng section of note investment loan and long term receivables in the note to consolidated financial statement for additional information asset retirement obligation and environmental cost under various contract permit and regulation we have material legal obligation to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operation at operational site our largest asset removal obligation involve plugging and abandonment of well removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platform around the world well oil and gas production facility and pipeline in alaska the fair value of obligation for dismantling and removing these facility are recorded liability and an increase to pp at the time of installation of the asset based on estimated discounted cost estimating future asset removal cost is difficult most of these removal obligation are many year or decade in the future and the contract and regulation often have vague description of what removal practice and criterion must be met when the removal event actually occurs asset removal technology and cost regulatory and other compliance consideration expenditure timing and other input into valuation of the obligation including discount and inflation rate are also subject to change normally change in asset removal obligation are reflected in the income statement increase or decrease to dd over the remaining life of the asset however for asset at or nearing the end of their operation well previously sold asset for which we retained the asset removal obligation an increase in the asset removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings because any increase in pp due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment due to the low fair value of these property in addition to asset removal obligation under the above or similar contract permit and regulation we have certain environmental related project these are primarily related to remediation activity required by canada and various state within the united state at exploration and production site future environmental remediation cost are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factor the uncertain magnitude of cleanup cost the unknown time and extent of such remedial action that may be required and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible party see note asset retirement obligation and accrued environmental cost in the note to consolidated financial statement for additional information projected benefit obligation determination of the projected benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plan are important to the recorded amount for such obligation on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement the actuarial determination of projected benefit obligation and company contribution requirement involves judgment about uncertain future event including estimated retirement date salary level at retirement mortality rate lump sum election rate rate of return on plan asset future health care cost trend rate and rate of utilization of health care service by retiree due to the specialized nature of these calculation we engage outside actuarial firm to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligation and company contribution requirement for employee retirement income security act governed pension plan the actuary exercise fiduciary care on behalf of plan participant in the determination of the judgmental assumption used in determining required company contribution into the plan due to differing objective and requirement between financial accounting rule and the pension plan funding regulation promulgated by governmental agency the actuarial method and assumption for the two table of content purpose differ in certain important respect ultimately we will be required to fund all vested benefit under pension and postretirement benefit plan not funded by plan asset or investment return but the judgmental assumption used in the actuarial calculation significantly affect periodic financial statement and funding pattern over time projected benefit obligation are particularly sensitive to the discount rate assumption percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase projected benefit obligation by million benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan asset assumption percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by million while percent decrease in the return on plan asset assumption would increase annual benefit expense by million in determining the discount rate we use yield on high quality fixed income investment matched to the estimated benefit cash flow of our plan we are also exposed to the possibility that lump sum retirement benefit taken from pension plan during the year could exceed the total of service and interest component of annual pension expense and trigger accelerated recognition of portion of unrecognized net actuarial loss and gain these benefit payment are based on decision by plan participant and are therefore difficult to predict in the event there is significant reduction in the expected year of future service of present employee or elimination for significant number of employee the accrual of defined benefit for some or all of their future service we could recognize curtailment gain or loss see note employee benefit plan in the note to consolidated financial statement for additional information contingency number of claim and lawsuit are made against the company arising in the ordinary course of business management exercise judgment related to accounting and disclosure of these claim which includes loss damage and underpayment associated with environmental remediation tax contract and other legal dispute we learn new fact concerning contingency we reassess our position both with respect to amount recognized and disclosed considering change to the probability of additional loss and potential exposure however actual loss can and do vary from estimate for variety of reason including legal arbitration or other third party decision settlement discussion evaluation of scope of damage interpretation of regulatory or contractual term expected timing of future action and proportion of liability shared with other responsible party estimated future cost related to contingency are subject to change event evolve and additional information becomes available during the administrative and

production method based on estimated proved oil and gas reserve amortization of intangible development cost is based on the unit of production method using estimated proved developed oil and gas reserve capitalized interest interest from external borrowing is capitalized on major project with an expected construction period of one year or longer capitalized interest is added to the cost of the underlying asset and is amortized over the useful life of the asset in the same manner the underlying asset depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization of pp on producing hydrocarbon property and certain pipeline asset those which are expected to have declining utilization pattern are determined by the unit of production method depreciation and amortization of all other pp are determined by either the individual unit straight line method or the group straight line method for those individual unit that are highly integrated with other unit impairment of property plant and equipment pp used in operation are assessed for impairment whenever change in fact and circumstance indicate possible significant deterioration in the future cash flow expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following update to corporate planning assumption if there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered the asset is monitored by management through an established process where change to significant assumption such price volume and future development plan are reviewed if upon review the sum of the undiscounted before tax cash flow is le than the carrying value of the asset group the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value through additional amortization or depreciation provision and reported impairment in the period in which the determination of the impairment is made individual asset are grouped for impairment purpose at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flow that are largely independent of the cash flow of other group of asset generally on field by field basis for exploration and production asset because there usually is lack of quoted market price for long lived asset the fair value of impaired asset is typically determined based on the present value of expected future cash flow using discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participant or based on multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transaction of similar asset where possible long lived asset committed by management for disposal within one year are accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value le cost to sell with fair value determined using binding negotiated price if available or present value of expected future cash flow previously described the expected future cash flow used for impairment review and related fair value calculation are based on estimated future production volume price and cost considering all available evidence at the date of review the impairment review includes cash flow from proved developed and undeveloped reserve including any development expenditure necessary to achieve that production additionally when probable and possible reserve exist an appropriate risk adjusted amount of these reserve may be included in the impairment calculation table of content

salvage value is charged or credited to accumulated depreciation asset retirement obligation and environmental cost the fair value of legal obligation to retire and remove long lived asset are recorded in the period in which the obligation is incurred typically when the asset is installed at the production location when the liability is initially recorded we capitalize this cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related pp if in subsequent period our estimate of this liability change we will record an adjustment to both the liability and pp over time the liability is increased for the change in it present value and the capitalized cost in pp is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset for additional information see note asset retirement obligation and accrued environmental cost environmental expenditure are expensed or capitalized depending upon their future economic benefit expenditure relating to an existing condition caused by past operation and those having no future economic benefit are expensed liability for environmental expenditure are recorded on an undiscounted basis unless acquired in purchase business combination which we record on

are released from exposure under the guarantee we amortize the guarantee liability over the relevant time period if one exists based on the fact and circumstance surrounding each type of guarantee in case where the guarantee term is indefinite we reverse the liability when we have information indicating the liability is essentially relieved or amortize it over an appropriate time period the fair value of our guarantee exposure decline over time we amortize the guarantee liability to the related income statement line item based on the nature of the guarantee when it becomes probable that we

indemnification at december wa approximately million we amortize the indemnification liability over the relevant time period if one exists based on the fact and circumstance surrounding each type of indemnity in case where the indemnification term is indefinite we will reverse the liability when we have information the liability is essentially relieved or amortize the liability over an appropriate time period the fair value of our indemnification exposure decline although it is reasonably possible future payment may exceed amount recorded due to the nature of the indemnification it

these contingency in the case of all known contingency other than those related to income tax we accrue liability when the loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable if range of amount can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is better estimate than any other amount then the minimum of the range is accrued we do not reduce these liability for potential insurance or third party recovery if applicable we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third party recovery with respect to income tax related contingency we use cumulative probability weighted loss accrual in case where sustaining tax position is le than certain see note income tax for additional information about income tax related contingency table of content based on currently available information we believe it is remote that future cost related to known contingent liability exposure will exceed current accrual by an amount that would have material adverse impact on our consolidated

change include contingent liability recorded for environmental remediation tax and legal matter estimated future environmental remediation cost are subject to change due to such factor the uncertain magnitude of cleanup cost the unknown time and extent of such remedial action that may be required and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible party estimated

best estimate using all information that is available at the time we measure estimate and base liability on currently available fact existing technology and presently enacted law and regulation taking into account stakeholder and business consideration when measuring environmental liability we also consider our prior experience in remediation of contaminated site other company cleanup experience and data released by the environmental protection agency epa or other organization we consider unasserted claim in our determination of environmental liability and we accrue them in the period they are both probable and reasonably estimable although liability of those potentially responsible for environmental remediation cost is generally joint and several for federal site and frequently so for other site we are usually only one of many company cited at particular site due to the joint and several liability we could be responsible for all cleanup cost related to any site at which we have been designated potentially responsible party we have been successful to date in sharing cleanup cost with other financially sound company many of the site at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the epa or the agency concerned prior to actual cleanup those potentially responsible normally ass the site condition apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation in some instance we may have no liability or may attain settlement of liability where it appears that other potentially responsible party may be financially unable to bear their proportional share we consider this inability in estimating our potential liability and we adjust our accrual accordingly result of various acquisition in the past we assumed certain environmental obligation some of these environmental obligation are mitigated by indemnification made by others for our benefit and some of the indemnification are subject to dollar limit and time limit we are currently participating in environmental assessment and cleanup at numerous federal superfund and comparable state and international site after an assessment of environmental exposure for cleanup and other cost we make accrual on an undiscounted basis except those acquired in purchase business combination which we record on discounted basis for planned investigation and remediation

expected to be recovered through existing well with existing equipment and operating method or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of new well and through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserve estimate if the extraction is by mean not involving well proved undeveloped reserve are proved reserve expected to be recovered from new well on undrilled acreage or from existing well where relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion table of content we have companywide comprehensive sec compliant internal policy that governs the determination and reporting of proved reserve this policy is applied by the geologist and reservoir engineer in our business unit around the world part of our internal control process each business unit reserve process and control are reviewed annually by an internal team which is headed by the company manager of reserve compliance and reporting this team composed of internal reservoir engineer geologist finance personnel and senior representative from degolyer and macnaughton third party petroleum engineering consulting firm review the business unit reserve for adherence to sec guideline and company policy through on site visit teleconference and review of documentation in addition to providing independent review this internal team also ensures reserve are calculated using consistent and appropriate standard and procedure this team is independent of business unit line management and is responsible for reporting it finding to senior management the team is responsible for communicating our reserve policy and procedure and is available for internal peer review and consultation on major project or technical issue throughout the year all of our proved reserve held by consolidated company and our share of equity affiliate have been estimated by conocophillips during our process and control used to ass over percent of proved reserve of december were reviewed by the purpose of their review wa to ass whether the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal process and control used to determine estimate of proved reserve are in accordance with sec regulation in such review conocophillips technical staff presented with an overview of the reserve data well the method and assumption used in estimating reserve the data presented included pertinent seismic information geologic map well log production test material balance calculation reservoir simulation model well performance data operating procedure and relevant economic criterion management intent in retaining to review it process and control wa to provide objective third party input on these process and control opinion wa the general process and control employed by conocophillips in estimating it december proved reserve for the property reviewed are in accordance with the sec reserve definition report is included exhibit of this annual report on form the
