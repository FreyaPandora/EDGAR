offering opentable in july we acquired opentable leading brand for booking online restaurant reservation headquartered in san francisco california opentable provides online restaurant reservation service to consumer and reservation management service to restaurant opentable doe business primarily in the united state though it intends to continue to invest in expanding it international offering marketing and brand awareness booking com priceline com kayak agoda com rentalcars com and opentable have established widely used and recognized commerce brand through aggressive marketing and promotion campaign result both our online and offline advertising expense ha increased significantly in recent year trend we expect to continue during our total online advertising expense wa approximately billion substantial portion of which wa spent internationally through internet search engine primarily google meta search and travel research service and affiliate marketing we also invested million in offline advertising we intend to continue strategy of aggressively promoting brand awareness primarily through online mean although we also intend to increase our offline advertising effort including by expanding offline campaign into additional market for example building on it first offline advertising campaign which it launched in the united state in booking com ha begun offline advertising campaign in other market including australia canada the united kingdom and germany we recognize substantial majority of online advertising expense incurred at the time reservation is booked recognize of our gross profit when the consumer travel or dining experience is completed result online advertising expense may not be recognized in the period the associated gross profit online advertising efficiency expressed online advertising percentage of gross profit is impacted by number of factor that are subject to variability and that are in case outside of our control including average daily rate adrs cost per click cancellation rate foreign exchange rate our ability to convert paid traffic to booking customer and the extent to which consumer come directly to our website or mobile apps for booking from to our online advertising grew faster than our gross profit due to year over year decline in online advertising return on investment roi and brand mix within the priceline group our international brand grew faster than our brand and spent higher percentage of gross profit on online advertising in these trend continued but more than offset by the inclusion of kayak and opentable because they spend lower percentage of gross profit on online advertising than our other also our consolidated result exclude intercompany advertising by our brand on kayak since our acquisition of kayak in may competition we compete with both online and traditional travel reservation service the market for the travel reservation service we offer is intensely competitive and current and new competitor can launch new service at relatively low cost some of our current and potential competitor such google apple alibaba amazon and facebook have access to significantly greater and more diversified resource than we and they may be able to leverage other aspect of their business search or mobile device business to enable to compete more effectively with for example google ha entered various aspect of the online travel market through it acquisition in of ita software inc major flight information software company it hotel meta search service known hotel finder and it license of hotel booking software from room we currently or potentially may in the future compete with variety of company including online travel reservation service such expedia hotel com hotwire travelocity elong wotif carrentals com and venere which are owned by expedia orbitz com cheaptickets ebookers hotelclub and ratestogo which are owned by orbitz worldwide which ha agreed to be acquired by expedia laterooms and asiarooms which are owned by tui travel hotel reservation service and hotel de which are owned by hotel reservation service and autoeurope car trawler ctrip makemytrip webjet rakuten jalan hotel urbano viajanet submarino viagens despegar decolar com bookit com cheapoair mr and mr smith and edreams odigeo online accommodation search and or reservation service such homeaway and airbnb focused on vacation rental property including individually owned property large online company including search social networking and marketplace company such google facebook alibaba amazon and groupon traditional travel agency wholesaler and tour operator many of which combine physical location telephone service and online service such carlson wagonlit american express thomas cook and tui travel well thousand of individual travel agency around the world travel service provider such accommodation provider rental car company and airline many of which have their own branded website to which they drive business including joint effort by travel service provider such room key an online hotel reservation service owned by several major hotel company online travel search service and price comparison service generally referred to meta search service such tripadvisor trivago in which expedia ha acquired majority ownership interest qunar skyscanner and hotelscombined and online restaurant reservation service such tripadvisor lafourchette and yelp seatme tripadvisor leading travel research and review website google the world largest search engine and other large established company with substantial resource and expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating internet traffic have launched meta search service and may create additional inroad into online travel both in the united state and internationally meta search service leverage their search technology to aggregate travel search result for the consumer specific itinerary across travel service provider accommodation rental car company or airline ota and other travel website and in many instance compete directly with for customer meta search service intend to appeal to consumer by showing broader travel search result than may be available through otas or other travel website which could lead to travel service provider or others gaining larger share of search traffic tripadvisor ha begun supporting it meta search service with offline advertising and trivago leading meta search service in europe ha been aggressively advertising in the united state since google offer hotel finder meta search service that google ha at time placed at or near the top of it hotel related search result through our kayak meta search service we compete directly with other meta search service kayak depends on access to information related to travel service pricing schedule availability and other related information from otas and travel service provider consumer may favor travel service offered by meta search website or search company over otas which could reduce traffic to our travel reservation website increase consumer awareness of our competitor brand and website and our advertising and other customer acquisition cost to the extent any such consumer behavior lead to growth in our kayak meta search business such growth may not result in sufficient increase in profit from our kayak meta search business to offset any related decrease in profit experienced by our ota brand further meta search service may evolve into more traditional otas by offering consumer the ability to make travel reservation directly through their website for example tripadvisor facilitates hotel reservation on it transactional website tingo and jetsetter and allows consumer to make reservation while staying on tripadvisor through it instant booking offering we currently do not participate in instant booking and therefore risk losing share of reservation sourced through tripadvisor other meta search provider may also offer direct booking service with travel service provider which may lead to more consumer booking directly with travel service provider rather than an ota to the extent consumer book travel service through meta search website or directly with travel service provider after visiting meta search website or meta search utility on traditional search engine without using an ota like or if meta search service limit our participation within their search result we may need to increase our advertising or other customer acquisition cost to maintain or grow our reservation booking and our business gross booking and result of operation could be adversely affected result of our acquisition of opentable we now compete or may in the future compete with other restaurant reservation provider such lafourchette european restaurant reservation business owned by tripadvisor and yelp seatme service travel service provider including multi national hotel chain rental car company and airline with which we conduct business compete with in online channel to drive consumer to their own website in lieu of third party distributor like travel service provider that sell on their own website may charge lower price and in some instance offer advantage such loyalty point or special discount to member of closed user group such loyalty program participant or customer with registered account any of which could make their offering more attractive to consumer than our service discounting may increase competition authority seek to allow increased pricing flexibility among provider of travel service reservation we may need to offer similar advantage to maintain or grow our reservation booking which could adversely impact our profitability widespread adoption of mobile device such the iphone android enabled smart phone and tablet such the ipad coupled with the improved web browsing functionality and development of thousand of useful apps available on these device is driving substantial online traffic and commerce to mobile platform we have experienced significant shift of business to mobile platform and our advertising partner are also seeing rapid shift of traffic to mobile platform our major competitor and certain new market entrant are offering mobile application for travel product and other functionality including proprietary last minute discount for accommodation reservation advertising and distribution opportunity may be more limited on mobile device given their smaller screen size the gross profit earned on mobile transaction may be le than typical desktop transaction due to different consumer purchasing pattern for example accommodation reservation made on mobile device typically are for shorter length of stay and are not made far in advance further given the device size and technical limitation of tablet and smart phone mobile consumer may not be willing to download multiple apps from multiple company providing similar service and instead prefer to use one or limited number of apps for their mobile travel and restaurant research and reservation activity result the consumer experience with mobile apps well brand recognition and loyalty are likely to become increasingly important our mobile offering have received strong review and are driving material and increasing share of our business we believe that mobile booking present an opportunity for growth and are necessary to maintain and grow our business consumer increasingly turn to mobile device instead of personal computer if we are unable to continue to rapidly innovate and create new user friendly and differentiated mobile offering and efficiently and effectively advertise and distribute on these platform or if our mobile offering are not used by consumer we could lose market share to existing competitor or new entrant and our future growth and result of operation could be adversely affected apple inc one of the most innovative and successful company in the world and producer of among other thing the iphone and ipad obtained patent for itravel mobile app that would allow traveler to check in for travel reservation in addition apple iphone operating system includes passbook virtual wallet app that hold ticket boarding pass coupon and gift card and along with itravel may be indicative of apple intent to enter the travel reservation business in some capacity apple ha substantial market share in the smart phone category and control integration of offering including travel service into it mobile operating system apple also ha more experience producing and developing mobile apps and ha access to greater resource than we have apple may use or expand itravel passbook siri apple voice recognition concierge service apple pay apple new mobile payment system or another mobile app or functionality mean of entering the travel reservation marketplace similarly google android operating system is the leading smart phone operating system in the world result google could leverage it android operating system to give it travel service competitive advantage either technically or with prominence on it google play app store or within it mobile result to the extent apple or google use their mobile operating system or app distribution channel to favor their own travel service offering our business could be harmed ha been proliferation of new channel through which accommodation provider can offer reservation for example company such homeaway and airbnb offer service focused on providing vacation rental property owner particularly individual an online place to list their accommodation where traveler can search and book such property company such hoteltonight tingo and hipmunk have developed new and differentiated offering that endeavor to provide saving on accommodation reservation to consumer and that compete directly with further meta search service may lower the cost for new company to enter the market by providing distribution channel without the cost of promoting the new entrant brand to drive consumer directly to it website if any of these service are successful in attracting consumer would otherwise use our service our business and result of operation would be harmed competition in online travel remains intense and online travel company are creating new promotion and consumer value feature in an effort to gain competitive advantage in particular the competition to provide opaque accommodation reservation service to consumer an area in which our priceline com business ha been leader ha become more intense for example expedia make opaque accommodation room reservation available on it principal website under the name expedia unpublished rate and ha we believe supported this initiative with steeper discount through lower margin we believe these offering in particular expedia unpublished rate have adversely impacted the market share and year over year growth rate of priceline com name your own price opaque hotel reservation service which ha been experiencing decline in room night reservation since these and other competitor could also launch opaque rental car service which could negatively impact priceline com name your own price and express deal opaque rental car reservation service result of this increased competition our share of the discount accommodation reservation market in the united state could further decrease which would harm our business and result of operation operation and technology our business is supported by multiple system platform which were designed with an emphasis on scalability performance and reliability the platform are largely independent among booking com priceline com kayak agoda com rentalcars com and opentable the software platform and architecture use variety of tool within each corporate implementation including server side java asp net perl php javascript and sql script integrated with oracle mysql mongodb cassandra and microsoft sql server database system these internal platform were designed to include open application protocol interface that can provide connectivity to vendor in the industry in which we operate these include large global system such accommodation room airline ticket and rental car reservation system and financial service provider well individual accommodation service provider such individual hotel our application utilize digital certificate to help conduct secure communication and transaction appropriate the system infrastructure and web and database server of our worldwide operation are primarily hosted in england the netherlands hong kong switzerland and five location in the united state each of which provides network connectivity networking infrastructure ups conditioned power and hour monitoring and engineering support typical of hosted data center all data center facility have continuous power supply system generator redundant server and multiple back system if one hosting facility were inaccessible for any reason we would need to divert traffic to another hosting facility which may lead to disruption to our service foregone transaction and revenue and consumer complaint customer service for our international business is provided primarily through in house call center we outsource most of the call center and customer service function for our business intellectual property over time and through acquisition we have assembled portfolio of patent trademark service mark copyright domain name and trade secret covering our service we regard the protection of our intellectual property critical to our success we protect our intellectual property right by relying on national federal state and common law right in the united state and internationally well variety of administrative procedure regulation convention and treaty we also rely on contractual restriction to protect our proprietary right in our service we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreement with employee and contractor and nondisclosure agreement with party with we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information we pursue the registration of our domain name trademark and service mark in the united state and internationally we currently hold numerous issued and international patent and pending and international patent application we file additional patent application on new invention we deem appropriate effective trademark patent domain name trade dress and trade secret protection is expensive to maintain and may require litigation we continue to expand internationally protecting our intellectual property right and other proprietary right involves an increasing number of jurisdiction process that is expensive and time consuming and may not be successful in every location see risk factor we face risk related to our intellectual property governmental regulation the service we provide are subject to various law and regulation for example our travel service are subject to law governing the offer and or sale of travel service well law requiring to register seller of travel in certain jurisdiction in addition our service may be subject to various taxing regulation see risk factor we may have exposure to additional tax liability risk factor our financial result will likely be materially impacted by payment of income tax in the future and risk factor adverse application of state and local tax law could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation we are subject to law that require protection of user privacy and user data in our processing of reservation we receive and store large volume of personally identifiable data in the united state europe and asia this data is increasingly subject to law and regulation in numerous jurisdiction around the world including the commission of the european union through it data protection directive and variation and implementation of that directive in the member state of the european union such government action is typically intended to protect the privacy of personal data that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction see risk factor our processing storage use and disclosure of personal data expose to risk of internal or external security breach and could give rise to liability and risk factor cookie law could negatively impact the way we do business we are also subject to anti trust and competition law and the competition authority in various jurisdiction have begun investigation into competitive practice within the online travel industry including with respect to our business see risk factor the size of our business grows we may become increasingly subject to the scrutiny of anti trust and competition regulator in addition our strategy involves rapid geographic expansion around the world including in asia south america and elsewhere many of which region and country have different legislation regulatory environment and tax law compliance with legal regulatory and tax requirement around the world place demand on our time and resource and we may nonetheless experience unforeseen and potentially adverse legal regulatory or tax consequence which may have an adverse effect on our business see risk factor regulatory and legal requirement and uncertainty could harm our business seasonalitya meaningful amount of gross booking are generated early in the year customer plan and reserve their spring and summer vacation in europe and north america from cost perspective we expense the substantial majority of our advertising activity the expense is incurred which is typically in the quarter in which reservation are booked however we generally do not recognize associated revenue future quarter when the travel occurs result we typically experience our highest level of profitability in the second and third quarter of the year which is when we experience the highest level of accommodation checkout for the year for our north american and european business in addition the date on which certain holiday fall can have an impact on our quarterly result for example in our second quarter year over year growth rate in revenue gross profit operating income and operating margin were adversely affected by easter falling in the first quarter instead of the second quarter it in conversely our second quarter year over year growth rate in revenue gross profit operating income and operating margin were favorably impacted by easter falling in the second quarter instead of the first quarter it did in the impact of seasonality can be exaggerated in the short term by the gross booking growth rate of the business for example in period where our growth rate substantially decelerates our operating margin typically benefit from relatively le variable advertising expense in addition gross profit growth is typically le impacted in the near term due to the benefit of revenue related to reservation booked in previous quarter we experience the highest level of booking and travel consumption for our asia pacific and south american business in the first and fourth quarter therefore if these business continue to grow faster than our north american and european business our operating result for the first and fourth quarter of the year may become more significant over time percentage of full year operating result of december we employed approximately employee of which approximately are based in the united state and approximately are based outside the united state we also retain independent contractor to support our customer service website content translation and system support function we have never had work stoppage and our employee are not represented by any collective bargaining unit we consider our relation with our employee to be good our future success will depend in part on our ability to continue to attract integrate retain and motivate highly qualified technical and managerial personnel for whom competition is intense see risk factor we rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business would be harmed the priceline group

experience other concern or effect that reduce their ability or willingness to travel for example the recent worldwide recession led to weakening in the fundamental demand for our travel reservation service and an increase in the number of consumer who canceled existing travel reservation with also during the recession the accommodation industry experienced significant decrease in occupancy rate and average daily rate adrs while lower occupancy rate have historically resulted in accommodation provider increasing their distribution of accommodation reservation through third party intermediary such our remuneration for accommodation reservation transaction change proportionately with price and therefore lower adrs generally have negative effect on our accommodation reservation business and negative effect on our gross profit further during period of higher occupancy rate accommodation provider may decrease their distribution of accommodation reservation through third party intermediary like in particular through our discount service such priceline com name your own price and express deal many government around the world including the government and certain european government are operating at large financial deficit resulting in high level of sovereign debt in such country greece ireland portugal and certain other european union country with high level of sovereign debt at time have had difficulty refinancing their debt failure to reach political consensus regarding workable solution to these issue ha resulted in high level of uncertainty regarding the future economic outlook this uncertainty well concern over governmental austerity measure including higher tax and reduced government spending could impair consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand greece newly elected government which campaigned austerity measure may not be able to reach an acceptable solution to the country debt crisis with the european union this may increase the likelihood that greece and in turn other country could exit the european union which could lead to added economic uncertainty and further devaluation or eventual abandonment of the euro common currency at time we have experienced volatility in transaction growth rate and weaker trend in hotel adrs across many region of the world particularly in those european country that appear to be most affected by economic uncertainty we believe that these business trend are likely impacted by weak economic condition and sovereign debt concern disruption in the economy of such country could cause contribute to or be indicative of deteriorating macro economic condition the uncertainty of macro economic factor and their impact on consumer behavior which may differ across region make it more difficult to forecast industry and consumer trend and the timing and degree of their impact on our market and business which in turn could adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our business and adversely affect our result of operation in addition other unforeseen event beyond our control such oil price terrorist attack unusual weather pattern natural disaster such earthquake hurricane tsunami flood and volcanic eruption travel related health concern including pandemic and epidemic such ebola influenza avian bird flu and sars political instability regional hostility imposition of tax or surcharge by regulatory authority or travel related accident can disrupt travel or otherwise result in decline in travel demand because these event or concern are largely unpredictable they can dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior by consumer and therefore demand for our service which can adversely affect our business and result of operation for example in late hurricane sandy disrupted travel in the northeastern united state in early japan wa struck by major earthquake tsunami and nuclear emergency in october severe flooding in thailand key market for our agoda com business and the asian business of booking com negatively impacted booking volume and cancellation rate in that market in addition thailand recently experienced disruptive civil unrest which negatively impacted booking volume and cancellation rate in this market in early thailand also experienced civil unrest which caused the temporary relocation of agoda com thailand based operation future natural disaster health or civil or political unrest could further disrupt our business and operation and adversely affect our result of operation we face risk related to the growth rate and expansion of our international business we derive substantial portion of our revenue and have significant operation outside the united state our international operation include the netherlands based accommodation reservation service booking com the asia based accommodation reservation service agoda com the based rental car reservation service rentalcars com and to lesser extent kayak international meta search service and opentable international restaurant reservation business our international operation have achieved significant year over year growth in their gross booking an operating and statistical metric referring to the total dollar value generally inclusive of all tax and fee of all travel service purchased by our customer this growth rate which ha contributed significantly to our growth in consolidated revenue gross profit and earnings per share ha declined trend we expect to continue the absolute level of our gross booking grows larger other factor may also slow the growth rate of our revenue derived from our international business including for example worldwide economic condition any strengthening of the dollar versus the euro and other currency decline in adrs increase in cancellation adverse change in travel market condition and the competitiveness of the market decline in the growth rate of our international business could have negative impact on our future gross profit and earnings per share growth rate and consequence our stock price our strategy involves continued rapid international expansion in region throughout the world many of these region have different custom currency level of consumer acceptance and use of the internet for commerce legislation regulatory environment tax law and level of political stability international market may have strong local competitor with an established brand and travel service provider or restaurant relationship that may make expansion in that market difficult and costly and take more time than anticipated in addition compliance with legal regulatory or tax requirement in multiple jurisdiction place demand on our time and resource and we may nonetheless experience unforeseen and potentially adverse legal regulatory or tax consequence in some market such china legal and other regulatory requirement may prohibit or limit participation by foreign business such by making foreign ownership or management of internet or travel related business illegal or difficult or may make direct participation in those market uneconomic which could make our entry into and expansion in those market difficult or impossible require that we work with local partner or result in higher operating cost if we are unsuccessful in rapidly expanding in new and existing market and effectively managing that expansion our business result of operation and financial condition could be adversely affected certain market in which we operate that are in earlier stage of development have lower operating margin compared to more mature market which could have negative impact on our overall margin these market increase in size over time also we intend to continue to invest in adding accommodation available for reservation on our website including hotel bed and breakfast hostel and vacation rental vacation rental generally consist of among others property categorized single unit and multi unit villa apartment aparthotels which are apartment with front desk and cleaning service and chalet and are generally self catered include kitchen directly bookable property many of the newer accommodation we add to our travel reservation service especially in highly penetrated market may have fewer room lower adrs or higher credit risk and may appeal to smaller subset of consumer hostel and bed and breakfast and therefore may also negatively impact our margin for example because vacation rental is typically either single unit or small collection of independent unit vacation rental property represent more limited booking opportunity than non vacation rental property which generally have more unit to rent per property our non hotel accommodation in general may be subject to increased seasonality due to local tourism season weather or other factor we increase our non hotel accommodation business these different market characteristic could negatively impact our profit margin and to the extent these property represent an increasing percentage of the property added to our website our gross booking growth rate and property growth rate will likely diverge over time since each such property ha fewer booking opportunity result of the foregoing the percentage of non hotel accommodation increase the number of reservation per property will likely decrease in addition non hotel accommodation including vacation rental tend to be more seasonal in nature and may close during off season which impact our property count quarter to quarter we believe that the increase in the number of accommodation provider that participate on our website and the corresponding access to accommodation room night ha been key driver of the growth of our accommodation reservation business the growth in our accommodation booking typically make an attractive source of consumer demand for our accommodation provider however accommodation provider may wish to limit the amount of business that flow through single distribution channel result we may experience constraint on the number of accommodation room night available to which could negatively impact our growth rate and result of operation the number of our employee worldwide ha grown from le than in the first quarter of to approximately of december which growth is mostly comprised of hire by our international operation including of our international acquisition we may not be able to hire train retain motivate and manage required personnel which may limit our growth damage our reputation negatively affect our financial performance and otherwise harm our business in addition expansion increase the complexity of our business and place additional strain on our management operation technical performance financial resource and internal financial control and reporting function our current and planned personnel system procedure and control may not be adequate to support and effectively manage this growth and our future operation especially we employ personnel in multiple geographic location around the world we are subject to risk typical of international business including differing economic condition differing custom language and consumer expectation change in political climate differing tax structure and other regulation and restriction including labor law and custom and foreign exchange rate volatility intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance we compete with both online and traditional travel reservation service the market for the travel reservation service we offer is intensely competitive and current and new competitor can launch new service at relatively low cost some of our current and potential competitor such google apple alibaba amazon and facebook have access to significantly greater and more diversified resource than we do and they may be able to leverage other aspect of their business search or mobile device business to enable them to compete more effectively with for example google ha entered various aspect of the online travel market through it acquisition in of ita software inc major flight information software company it hotel meta search service known hotel finder discussed below and it license of hotel booking software from room we currently or potentially may in the future compete with variety of company including online travel reservation service such expedia hotel com hotwire travelocity elong wotif carrentals com and venere which are owned by expedia orbitz com cheaptickets ebookers hotelclub and ratestogo which are owned by orbitz worldwide which ha agreed to be acquired by expedia laterooms and asiarooms which are owned by tui travel hotel reservation service and hotel de which are owned by hotel reservation service and autoeurope car trawler ctrip makemytrip webjet rakuten jalan hotel urbano viajanet submarino viagens despegar decolar com bookit com cheapoair mr and mr smith and edreams odigeo online accommodation search and or reservation service such homeaway and airbnb focused on vacation rental property including individually owned property large online company including search social networking and marketplace company such google facebook alibaba amazon and groupon traditional travel agency wholesaler and tour operator many of which combine physical location telephone service and online service such carlson wagonlit american express thomas cook and tui travel well thousand of individual travel agency around the world travel service provider such accommodation provider rental car company and airline many of which have their own branded website to which they drive business including joint effort by travel service provider such room key an online hotel reservation service owned by several major hotel company online travel search and price comparison service generally referred to meta search service such tripadvisor trivago in which expedia ha acquired majority ownership interest qunar skyscanner and hotelscombined and online restaurant reservation service such tripadvisor lafourchette and yelp seatme tripadvisor leading travel research and review website google the world largest search engine and other large established company with substantial resource and expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating internet traffic have launched meta search service and may create additional inroad into online travel both in the united state and internationally meta search service leverage their search technology to aggregate travel search result for the consumer specific itinerary across travel service provider accommodation rental car company or airline online travel agent ota and other travel website and in many instance compete directly with for customer meta search service intend to appeal to consumer by showing broader travel search result than may be available through otas or other travel website which could lead to travel service provider or others gaining larger share of search traffic tripadvisor ha begun supporting it meta search service with offline advertising and trivago leading meta search service in europe ha been aggressively in the united state since google offer hotel finder meta search service that google ha at time placed at or near the top of hotel related search result through our kayak meta search service we compete directly with other meta search service kayak depends on access to information related to travel service pricing schedule availability and other related information from otas and travel service provider to the extent otas or travel service provider do not provide such information to kayak kayak business and result of operation could be harmed consumer may favor travel service offered by meta search website or search company over otas which could reduce traffic to our travel reservation website increase consumer awareness of our competitor brand and website and increase our advertising and other customer acquisition cost to the extent any such consumer behavior lead to growth in our kayak meta search business such growth may not result in sufficient increase in profit from our kayak meta search business to offset any related decrease in profit experienced by our ota brand further meta search service may evolve into more traditional otas by offering consumer the ability to make travel reservation directly through their website for example tripadvisor facilitates hotel reservation on it transaction website tingo and jetsetter and intends to allow consumer to make reservation while staying on tripadvisor through it instant booking offering we currently do not participate in instant booking and therefore risk losing share of reservation sourced through tripadvisor other meta search provider may also offer direct booking service with travel service provider which may lead to more consumer booking directly with travel service provider rather than an ota to the extent consumer book travel service through meta search website or directly with travel service provider after visiting meta search website or meta search utility on traditional search engine without using an ota like or if meta search service limit our participation within their search result we may need to increase our advertising or other customer acquisition cost to maintain or grow our reservation booking and our business gross booking and result of operation could be adversely affected result of our acquisition of opentable we now compete or may in the future compete with other restaurant reservation provider such lafourchette european restaurant reservation business owned by tripadvisor and yelp seatme service travel service provider including multi national hotel chain rental car company and airline with which we conduct business compete with in online channel to drive consumer to their own website in lieu of third party distributor such travel service provider may charge lower price and in some instance offer advantage such loyalty point or special discount to member of closed user group such loyalty program participant or customer with registered account any of which could make their offering more attractive to consumer than our service discounting may increase competition authority seek to allow increased pricing flexibility among provider of travel service reservation we may need to offer similar advantage to maintain or grow our reservation booking which could adversely impact our profitability there ha been proliferation of new channel through which accommodation provider can offer reservation for example company such homeaway and airbnb offer service focused on providing vacation rental property owner particularly individual an online place to list their accommodation where traveler can search and book such property company such hoteltonight tingo and hipmunk have developed new and differentiated offering that endeavor to provide saving on accommodation reservation to consumer and that compete directly with further meta search service may lower the cost for new company to enter the market by providing distribution channel without the cost of promoting the new entrant brand to drive consumer directly to it website if any of these service are successful in attracting consumer who would otherwise use our service our business and result of operation would be harmed competition in online travel remains intense and online travel company are creating new promotion and consumer value feature in an effort to gain competitive advantage in particular the competition to provide opaque accommodation reservation service to consumer an area in which our priceline com business ha been leader ha become more intense for example expedia make opaque accommodation room reservation available through it hotwire brand and on it principal website under the name expedia unpublished rate and ha we believe supported this initiative with steeper discount through lower margin we believe these offering in particular expedia unpublished rate have adversely impacted the market share and year over year growth rate for priceline com name your own price opaque hotel reservation service which ha been experiencing decline in room night reservation since these and other competitor could also launch opaque rental car service which could negatively impact priceline com opaque name your own price rental car reservation service if expedia or others are successful in growing their opaque reservation service we may have le consumer demand for our opaque reservation service over time and we would face more competition for access to the limited supply of discounted reservation rate result of this increased competition our share of the discount accommodation reservation market in the united state could further decrease which could harm our business and result of operation in addition high hotel occupancy level in the united state have had an adverse impact on our access to hotel room for our opaque hotel reservation service further growth in discounted closed user group retail price for hotel room lessens the difference for member of the closed user group between retail hotel reservation and an opaque hotel reservation which may lead to fewer consumer using our opaque hotel reservation service in addition after entering into an exclusive long term strategic marketing agreement in august expedia acquired travelocity in january on february expedia announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire orbitz to the extent these acquisition enhance expedia ability to compete with in particular in the united state which is expedia travelocity and orbitz largest market our market share and result of operation could be adversely affected we are exposed to fluctuation in currency exchange rate we conduct substantial majority of our business outside the united state but we report our result in dollar result we face exposure to adverse movement in currency exchange rate the financial result of our international business are translated from local currency principally the euro and the british pound sterling into dollar the dollar significantly strengthened against the euro during moving from an exchange rate of dollar per euro of january to dollar per euro of december the dollar also strengthened significantly during this time frame compared to many other currency result our foreign currency denominated net asset gross booking gross profit operating expense and net income have been negatively impacted expressed in dollar for example gross profit from our international business grew year over year on local currency basis by approximately for the three month ended december but result of the impact of change in currency exchange rate grew by reported in dollar certain european union country with high level of sovereign debt have had difficulty at time refinancing their debt concern around devaluation or abandonment of the euro common currency or that sovereign default risk may become more widespread and could include the united state ha led to significant volatility in the exchange rate between the euro the british pound sterling the dollar and other currency the european central bank in an effort to stimulate the european economy recently launched quantitative easing program to purchase public debt which in turn ha caused the euro exchange rate to weaken compared to the dollar significant fluctuation in currency exchange rate can affect consumer travel behavior for example recent dramatic depreciation of the russian ruble ha resulted in it becoming more expensive for russian to travel to europe and most other non ruble destination consumer traveling from country whose currency ha weakened against other currency may book lower adr accommodation choose to shorten or cancel their international travel plan or choose to travel domestically rather than internationally any of which could adversely affect our gross booking revenue and result of operation in particular when expressed in dollar additionally foreign exchange rate fluctuation on transaction denominated in currency other than the functional currency result in gain and loss that are reflected in our financial result the volatility in foreign exchange rate and their impact on consumer behavior which may differ across region make it more difficult to forecast industry and consumer trend and the timing and degree of their impact on our market and business which in turn could adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our business and adversely affect our result of operation we rely on online advertising channel to enhance our brand awareness and to generate significant amount of traffic to our website we believe that maintaining and expanding the booking com priceline com kayak agoda com rentalcars com and opentable brand along with our other owned brand are important aspect of our effort to attract and retain customer effective online advertising ha been an important factor in our growth and we believe it will continue to be important to our future success our competitor spend increasingly more on advertising we are required to spend more in order to maintain our brand recognition and in the case of online advertising to maintain and grow traffic to our website in addition we have invested considerable money and resource in the establishment and maintenance of our brand and we will continue to invest resource in advertising marketing and other brand building effort to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brand we may not be able to successfully maintain or enhance consumer awareness and acceptance of our brand and even if we are successful in our branding effort such effort may not be cost effective if we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness and acceptance of our brand in cost effective manner our business market share and result of operation would be materially adversely affected online advertising efficiency expressed online advertising percentage of gross profit is impacted by number of factor that are subject to variability and that are in some case outside of our control including adrs cost per click cancellation rate foreign exchange rate our ability to convert paid traffic to booking customer and the extent to which consumer come directly to our website or mobile apps for booking for example competition for desired ranking in search result and or decline in ad click by consumer could increase our cost per click and reduce our online advertising efficiency we use third party website including online search engine primarily google meta search and travel research service and affiliate marketing primary mean of generating traffic to our website our online advertising expense ha increased significantly in recent year trend we expect to continue in addition from to our online advertising grew faster than our gross profit due to year over year decline in online advertising return on investment and brand mix within the priceline group our international brand grew faster than our brand and spent higher percentage of gross profit on online advertising in these trend continued but were more than offset by the inclusion of kayak and opentable because they spend lower percentage of gross profit on online advertising than our other brand also our consolidated result exclude intercompany advertising by our brand on kayak since our acquisition of kayak in may any reduction in our online advertising efficiency could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation whether through reduced gross profit or gross profit growth or through advertising expense increasing faster than gross profit and thereby reducing margin and earnings growth we believe that number of factor could cause consumer to engage in increased shopping behavior making travel purchase than they engaged in previously increased shopping behavior reduces our online advertising efficiency and effectiveness because traffic becomes le likely to result in purchase on our website and such traffic is more likely to be obtained through paid online advertising channel than through free direct channel further consumer may favor travel service offered by search company or meta search site over otas which could reduce traffic to our travel reservation website increase consumer awareness of our competitor brand and website increase our advertising and other customer acquisition cost and adversely affect our business margin and result of operation to the extent any such increased shopping behavior lead to growth in our kayak meta search business such growth may not result in sufficient increase in revenue from our kayak meta search business to offset any related decrease in gross profit or increase in advertising and other customer acquisition cost experienced by our ota brand our business could be negatively affected by change in internet search engine algorithm and dynamic or traffic generating arrangement we use google to generate significant portion of the traffic to our website and to lesser extent we use other search engine and meta search website to generate traffic to our website principally through pay per click advertising campaign the pricing and operating dynamic on these search engine can experience rapid change commercially technically and competitively for example google frequently update and change the logic which determines the placement and display of result of consumer search such that the placement of link to our website can be negatively affected and our cost to improve or maintain our placement in search result can increase google hotel finder utility that allows consumer to search and compare hotel accommodation ha at time placed at or near the top of hotel related search result if google change it present travel search result or the manner in which it conduct the auction for placement among search result in either case in manner that is competitively disadvantageous to whether to support it own travel related service or otherwise our ability to efficiently generate traffic to our website could be harmed which in turn would have an adverse effect on our business market share and result of operation in addition we purchase website traffic from number of other source including some operated by our competitor in the form of pay per click arrangement that can be terminated with little or no notice if one or more of such arrangement is terminated our business market share and result of operation could be adversely affected lastly we rely on various third party distribution channel marketing affiliate to distribute accommodation rental car and airline ticket reservation should one or more of such third party cease distribution of reservation made through or suffer deterioration in it search engine ranking due to change in search engine algorithm or otherwise our business and result of operation could be negatively affected recent trend in consumer adoption and use of mobile device create new challenge and may enable device company such apple to compete directly with widespread adoption of mobile device such the iphone android enabled smart phone and tablet such the ipad coupled with the improved web browsing functionality and development of thousand of useful apps available on these device is driving substantial online traffic and commerce to mobile platform we have experienced significant shift of business to mobile platform and our advertising partner are also seeing rapid shift of traffic to mobile platform our major competitor and certain new market entrant are offering mobile application for travel product and other functionality proprietary last minute discount for accommodation reservation advertising and distribution opportunity may be more limited on mobile device given their smaller screen size the gross profit earned on mobile transaction may be le than typical desktop transaction due to different consumer purchasing pattern for example accommodation reservation made on mobile device typically are for shorter length of stay and are not made far in advance further given the device size and technical limitation of tablet and smartphones mobile consumer may not be willing to download multiple apps from multiple company providing similar service and instead prefer to use one or limited number of apps for their mobile travel and restaurant research and reservation activity result the consumer experience with mobile apps well brand recognition and loyalty are likely to become increasingly important our mobile offering have received strong review and are driving material and increasing share of our business we believe that mobile booking present an opportunity for growth and are necessary to maintain and grow our business consumer increasingly turn to mobile device instead of personal computer result it is increasingly important for to develop and maintain effective mobile apps and website optimized for mobile device to provide customer with an appealing easy to use mobile experience if we are unable to continue to rapidly innovate and create new user friendly and differentiated mobile offering and efficiently and effectively advertise and distribute on these platform or if our mobile offering are not used by consumer we could lose market share to existing competitor or new entrant and our future growth and result of operation could be adversely affected apple one of the most innovative and successful company in the world and producer of among other thing the iphone and ipad obtained patent for itravel mobile app that would allow traveler to check in for travel reservation in addition apple iphone operating system includes passbook virtual wallet app that hold ticket boarding pass coupon and gift card and along with itravel may be indicative of apple intent to enter the travel reservation business in some capacity apple ha substantial market share in the smart phone category and control integration of offering including travel service into it mobile operating system apple also ha more experience producing and developing mobile apps and ha access to greater resource than we have apple may use or expand itravel passbook siri apple voice recognition concierge service apple pay apple new mobile payment system or another mobile app or functionality mean of entering the travel reservation marketplace similarly google android operating system is the leading smart phone operating system in the world result google could leverage it android operating system to give it travel service competitive advantage either technically or with prominence on it google play app store or within it mobile search result to the extent apple or google use their mobile operating system or app distribution channel to favor their own travel service offering our business could be harmed our processing storage use and disclosure of personal data expose to risk of internal or external security breach and could give rise to liability the security of data when engaging in electronic commerce is essential to maintaining consumer and travel service provider confidence in our service any security breach whether instigated internally or externally on our system or other internet based system could significantly harm our reputation and therefore our business brand market share and result of operation we currently require consumer who use certain of our service to guarantee their offer with their credit card either online or in some instance through our toll free telephone service we require user name and password in order to access our information technology system we also use encryption and authentication technology to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to our data or account it is possible that computer circumvention capability new discovery or advance or other development including our own act or omission could result in compromise or breach of consumer data for example third party may attempt to fraudulently induce employee or customer to disclose user name password or other sensitive information phishing which may in turn be used to access our information technology system or to defraud our customer we have experienced targeted and organized phishing attack and may experience more in the future our effort to protect information from unauthorized access may be unsuccessful or may result in the rejection of legitimate attempt to book reservation through our service any of which could result in lost business and materially adversely affect our business reputation and result of operation our existing security measure may not be successful in preventing security breach party whether internal external an affiliate or unrelated third party that is able to circumvent our security system could steal consumer information or transaction data or other proprietary information in the last year several major company including sony homedepot jpmorgan target zappos apple aol linkedin google and yahoo experienced high profile security breach that exposed their customer and employee personal information we expend significant resource to protect against security breach and we may need to increase our security related expenditure to maintain or increase our system security or to address problem caused and liability incurred by breach these issue are likely to become more difficult to manage we expand the number of place where we operate and the tool and technique used in such attack become more advanced recently experienced by sony security breach could result in severe damage to our information technology infrastructure including damage that could impair our ability to offer our service or the ability of consumer to make reservation or conduct search through our service well loss of customer financial or other data that could materially adversely affect our ability to conduct our business satisfy our commercial obligation or meet our public reporting requirement in timely fashion or at all security breach could also result in negative publicity damage our reputation expose to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability subject to regulatory penalty and sanction or cause consumer to lose confidence in our security and choose to use the service of our competitor any of which would have negative effect on the value of our brand our market share and our result of operation our insurance policy carry low coverage limit and would likely not be adequate to reimburse for loss caused by security breach we also face risk associated with security breach affecting third party conducting business over the internet consumer generally are concerned with security and privacy on the internet and any publicized security problem could inhibit the growth of the internet and negatively affect consumer willingness to provide private information or effect commercial transaction on the internet generally including through our service some of our business is conducted with third party marketing affiliate which may generate travel reservation through our infrastructure or through other system additionally consumer using our service could be affected by security breach at third party such travel service provider payroll provider health plan provider payment processor or global distribution system gd upon which we rely security breach at any such third party marketing affiliate travel service provider gd or other third party on which we rely could be perceived by consumer security breach of our system and in any event could result in negative publicity damage our reputation expose to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and subject to regulatory penalty and sanction in addition such third party may not comply with applicable disclosure requirement which could expose to liability in our processing of travel transaction we receive and store large volume of personally identifiable data this data is increasingly subject to legislation and regulation in numerous jurisdiction around the world including the european union data protection directive and variation and implementation of that directive in the member state of the european union in addition the european union is actively considering new general data protection regulation designed to unify data protection with the european union under single law which may result in significantly greater compliance burden for company with user and operation in the european union under the draft general data protection regulation fine of up to euro or up to of the annual global turnover of the infringer could be imposed this government action is typically intended to protect the privacy of personal data that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction in many case these law apply not only to third party transaction but also to transfer of information between and our subsidiary including employee information these law continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction non compliance with these law could result in penalty or significant legal liability we could be adversely affected if legislation or regulation are expanded to require change in our business practice or if governing jurisdiction interpret or implement their legislation or regulation in way that negatively affect our business result of operation or financial condition we are also subject to payment card association rule and obligation under our contract with payment card processor under these rule and obligation if information is compromised we could be liable to payment card issuer for associated expense and penalty in addition if we fail to follow payment card industry security standard even if no customer information is compromised we could incur significant fine or experience significant increase in payment card transaction cost system capacity constraint system failure or denial of service or other attack could harm our business we have experienced rapid growth in consumer traffic to our website and through our mobile apps the number of accommodation on our extranets and the geographic breadth of our operation if our system can not be expanded to cope with increased demand or fail to perform we could experience unanticipated disruption in service slower response time decreased customer service and customer satisfaction and delay in the introduction of new service any of which could impair our reputation damage our brand and materially and adversely affect our result of operation further an online business we are dependent on the internet and maintaining connectivity between and consumer source of internet traffic such google and our travel service provider consumer increasingly turn to mobile device we also become dependent on consumer access to the internet through mobile carrier and their system disruption in internet access whether generally in specific market or otherwise especially if widespread or prolonged could materially adversely affect our business and result of operation while we do maintain redundant system and hosting service it is possible that we could experience an interruption in our business and we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate for all loss that may occur our computer hardware for operating our service is currently located at hosting facility around the world these system and operation are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error flood fire power loss telecommunication failure and similar event they are also subject to break in sabotage intentional act of vandalism terrorism and similar misconduct despite any precaution we may take the occurrence of any disruption of service due to any misconduct natural disaster or other unanticipated problem at such facility or the failure by such facility to provide our required data communication capacity could result in lengthy interruption or delay in our service any system failure that cause an interruption or delay in service could impair our reputation damage our brand or result in consumer choosing to use competitive service any of which could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation our existing security measure may not be successful in preventing attack on our system and any such attack could cause significant interruption in our operation for instance from time to time we have experienced denial of service type attack on our system that have made portion of our website slow or unavailable for period of time there are numerous other potential form of attack such phishing where third party attempt to infiltrate our system or acquire information by posing legitimate inquiry or electronic communication sql injection where third party attempt to obtain information or otherwise insert malicious code into our software through data entry field in our website and attempting to use our website platform to launch denial of service attack on another party each of which could cause significant interruption in our operation and potentially adversely affect our brand operation and result of operation or involve in legal or regulatory proceeding we expend significant resource in an attempt to prepare for and mitigate the effect of any such attack reduction in website availability and response time could cause loss of substantial business volume during the occurrence of any such attack on our system and measure we may take to divert suspect traffic in the event of such an attack could result in the diversion of bona fide customer these issue are likely to become more difficult to manage we expand the number of place where we operate and the tool and technique used in such attack become more advanced successful attack could result in negative publicity damage our reputation and prevent consumer from booking travel service researching travel service or making restaurant reservation through during the attack any of which could cause consumer to use the service of our competitor which would have negative effect on the value of our brand our market share and our result of operation we rely on certain third party computer system and third party service provider including gd and computerized central reservation system of the accommodation rental car and airline industry in connection with providing some of our service any interruption in these third party service and system or deterioration in their performance could prevent from booking related accommodation rental car and airline reservation and have material adverse effect on our business brand and result of operation our agreement with some third party service provider are terminable upon short notice and often do not provide recourse for service interruption in the event our arrangement with any such third party is terminated we may not be able to find an alternative source of system support on timely basis or on commercially reasonable term and result it could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation we depend upon various third party to process credit card for our merchant transaction around the world in addition we rely on third party to provide credit card number which we use payment mechanism for merchant transaction if any such third party were wholly or partially compromised our cash flow could be disrupted or we may not be able to generate merchant transaction and related revenue until such time replacement process could be put in place with different vendor we do not have completely formalized or comprehensive disaster recovery plan in every geographic region in which we conduct business in the event of certain system failure we may not be able to switch to back up system immediately and the time to full recovery could be prolonged like many online business we have experienced system failure from time to time in addition to placing increased burden on our engineering staff these outage create significant amount of consumer question and complaint that need to be addressed by our customer support personnel any unscheduled interruption in our service could result in an immediate loss of revenue that can be substantial increase customer service cost harm our reputation and cause some consumer to switch to our competitor if we experience frequent or persistent system failure our reputation and brand could be permanently and significantly harmed we have taken and continue to take step to increase the reliability and redundancy of our system these step are expensive may reduce our margin and may not be successful in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime we use both internally developed system and third party system to operate our service including transaction processing order management and financial system if the number of consumer using our service increase substantially or if critical third party system stop operating designed we will need to significantly expand and upgrade our technology transaction processing system financial and accounting system and other infrastructure we may not be able to upgrade our system and infrastructure to accommodate such condition in timely manner and depending on the third party system affected our transactional financial and accounting system could be impacted for meaningful amount of time before upgrade expansion or repair may have exposure to additional tax liability an international business providing reservation and advertising service around the world we are subject to income tax and non income based tax in both the united state and various non jurisdiction due to economic and political condition tax rate in various jurisdiction may be subject to significant change our future effective tax rate could be affected by change in the mix of earnings in country with differing statutory tax rate change in the valuation of deferred tax asset or change in tax law or their interpretation if our effective tax rate were to increase our cash flow financial condition and result of operation would be adversely affected although we believe that our tax filing position are reasonable the final determination of tax audit or tax dispute may be different from is reflected in our historical income tax provision and accrual to date we have been audited in several taxing jurisdiction with no significant impact on our financial condition result of operation or cash flow if future audit find that additional tax are due we may be subject to incremental tax liability possibly including interest and penalty which could have material adverse effect on our cash flow financial condition and result of operation for example french authority have initiated an audit to determine whether we are in compliance with our tax obligation in france and we expect to get preliminary response in the first half of while we believe that we comply with french tax law we expect french tax authority to assert that we owe additional tax and issue an assessment which could be significant and which could include penalty and interest in addition we may be required to pay upfront the full amount of any such assessment in order to appeal it though any such payment would not constitute an admission by that we owe the tax in general government in the united state and europe are increasingly focused on way to increase revenue which ha contributed to an increase in audit activity and harsher stance taken by tax authority any such additional tax or other assessment may be in excess of our current tax provision or may require to modify our business practice in order to reduce our exposure to additional tax going forward any of which could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition we will be subject to increased income tax in the event that our cash balance held outside the united state are remitted to the united state of december we held approximately billion of cash cash equivalent short term investment and long term investment outside of the united state we currently intend to use our cash held outside the united state to reinvest in our non operation if our cash balance outside the united state continue to grow and our ability to reinvest those balance outside the united state diminishes it will become increasingly likely that we will be subject to additional income tax expense in the united state with respect to our unremitted non earnings we would not make additional income tax payment unless we were to actually repatriate our international cash to the united state we would pay only federal alternative minimum tax and certain state income tax long we have net operating loss carryforwards available to offset our taxable income this could result in being subject to cash income tax liability on the earnings of our business sooner than would otherwise have been the case various legislative proposal that would reform corporate income tax law have been proposed by president obama administration well member of the congress including proposal that would significantly impact how multinational corporation are taxed on foreign earnings such proposal include change that would reduce tax deferral on certain foreign digital good and service transaction impose minimum tax on foreign earnings limit deduction for interest expense related to un repatriated non source income limit interest and royalty deduction in connection with certain related party transaction and put in place certain tax disincentive for offshoring job or business segment we can not determine whether some or all of these or other proposal will be enacted into law or what if any change may be made to such proposal prior to being enacted into law if tax law change in manner that increase our tax obligation our financial position and result of operation could be adversely impacted additionally the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd issued an action plan in july calling for coordinated multi jurisdictional approach to base erosion and profit shifting by multinational company the action plan expressed the oecd view that international tax standard have not kept pace with change in global business practice and concluded that change are needed to international tax law to address situation where multinationals may pay little or no tax in certain jurisdiction by shifting profit away from jurisdiction where the activity creating those profit may take place the action plan identified action the oecd determined are needed to address base erosion and profit shifting and generally set target date for completion of each of the item between and report addressing of these action were released by the oecd in september the proposed measure contained in these report are not yet finalized they may be affected by the proposal to be made with respect to the remaining action any change to international tax law including new definition of permanent establishment or change affecting the benefit of preferential tax regime such the dutch innovation box tax discussed below could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings and adversely impact our effective tax rate due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activity any change in international taxation of our activity may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and could adversely affect our financial position and result of operation we are also subject to non income based tax such value added payroll sale use net worth property and good and service tax in the united state and various non jurisdiction well the potential for travel transaction tax in the united state discussed below and in note to our consolidated financial statement for example in july and december the dutch government enacted certain amendment to dutch tax law including one time levy on an employer applied to employee earnings equal to of an employee earnings in excess of euro these irrevocable levy resulted in additional payroll tax of approximately million approximately million after tax in the fourth quarter of and approximately million approximately million after tax principally recorded in the third quarter of from time to time we are under audit by tax authority with respect to these non income based tax and may have exposure to additional non income based tax liability we may not be able to maintain our innovation box tax benefit the netherlands corporate income tax law provides that income generated from qualifying innovative activity is taxed at the rate of innovation box tax rather than the dutch statutory rate of booking com obtained ruling from the dutch tax authority confirming that portion of it earnings qualifying earnings is eligible for innovation box tax treatment this ruling wa renewed in july and is valid through december in order to be eligible for innovation box tax treatment booking com must among other thing apply for and obtain research and development certificate from dutch governmental agency every six month confirming that the activity that booking com intends to be engaged in over the subsequent six month period are innovative the certificate is current but should booking com fail to secure such certificate in any future period for example because the governmental agency doe not view booking com new or anticipated activity innovative or should this agency determine that the activity contemplated to be performed in prior period were not performed contemplated or did not comply with the agency requirement booking com may lose it certificate and result the innovation box tax benefit may be reduced or eliminated booking com intends to apply for continued innovation box tax treatment for future period however booking com application may not be accepted or if accepted the amount of qualifying earnings may be reduced or the applicable tax rate on qualifying earnings may be higher than the current rate in addition the tax law may change resulting in reduction or elimination of the tax benefit discussed above the oecd action plan involves in part evaluation of tax regime such the innovation box tax the european union council of economics and finance minister ecofin ha endorsed change to limit member state existing innovation and patent box tax regime providing benefit related to profit derived from intangible asset such intellectual property the change endorsed by ecofin would if adopted limit such benefit only to profit derived from patentable intellectual property it is expected that the legislative process related to the proposed change will begin in however the proposal may not be adopted in the form endorsed by ecofin or at all and it is expected that any change will include transition rule and will be fully implemented no later than july to the extent booking com intellectual property developed by it innovative activity do not meet the requirement under any new legislation booking com would eventually lose the benefit of the innovation box tax the loss of the innovation box tax benefit would substantially increase our effective tax rate and adversely impact our result of operation our financial result will likely be materially impacted by payment of income tax in the future until our net operating loss carryforwards are utilized or expire we do not expect to make tax payment on most of our income except for federal alternative minimum tax and state income tax however we expect to pay non tax on our non income other than in country where we have operating loss carryforwards we expect that our international business will continue to generate most of our revenue and profit and will continue to grow pretax income at higher rate than our business and therefore we expect that our tax payment will continue to increase any increase in our effective tax rate would have an adverse effect on our result of operation adverse application of state and local tax law could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation number of jurisdiction in the united state have initiated lawsuit against online travel company including related to among other thing the payment of travel transaction tax hotel occupancy tax excise tax sale tax etc in addition number of state county and municipality have initiated audit proceeding issued proposed tax or started inquiry relating to the payment of travel transaction tax see part item legal proceeding and note to the consolidated financial statement for description of these pending case and proceeding additional state and local jurisdiction may assert that we are subject to among other thing travel transaction tax and could seek to collect such tax either retroactively or prospectively or both in connection with some travel transaction tax audit and assessment we may be required to pay any assessed tax which amount may be substantial prior to being allowed to contest the assessment and the applicability of the law in judicial proceeding this requirement is commonly referred to pay to play or pay first payment of these amount if any is not an admission that we believe that we are subject to such tax and even if we make such payment we intend to continue to vigorously assert our position that we should not be subject to such tax litigation is subject to uncertainty and there could be adverse development in these pending or future case and proceeding for example in september the superior court in the district of columbia granted summary judgment in favor of the city and against online travel company similarly in january the tax appeal court for the state of hawaii held that online travel company including are liable for the state general excise tax on the full amount the online travel company collect from the customer for hotel room reservation without any offset for amount passed through to the hotel we recorded an accrual for travel transaction tax including estimated interest and penalty of approximately million in december and approximately million in the three month ended march primarily related to this ruling during the year ended december and december the company paid approximately million and million respectively to the state of hawaii related to this ruling the company ha filed an appeal with the tax appeal court and intends to vigorously appeal this ruling these decision and any similar decision in other jurisdiction could have material adverse effect on our business margin and result of operation an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending litigation may encourage the commencement of additional litigation audit proceeding or other regulatory inquiry in addition an unfavorable outcome or settlement of these action or proceeding could result in substantial liability for past and or future booking including among other thing interest penalty punitive damage and or attorney fee and cost there have been and will continue to be substantial ongoing cost which may include pay first payment associated with defending our position in pending and any future case or proceeding an adverse outcome in one or more of these unresolved proceeding could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation and could be material to our result of operation or cash flow in any given fiscal period to the extent that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that we have tax collection responsibility or we determine that we have such responsibility with respect to future transaction we may collect any such additional tax obligation from our customer which would have the effect of increasing the cost of travel reservation to our customer and consequently could make our travel reservation service le competitive versus the website of other online travel company or travel service provider and reduce our travel reservation transaction alternatively we could choose to reduce our profit on affected travel transaction either action could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation in many of the judicial and other proceeding initiated to date the taxing jurisdiction seek not only historical tax that are claimed to be owed on our gross profit but also among other thing interest penalty punitive damage and or attorney fee and cost therefore any liability associated with travel transaction tax matter is not constrained to our liability for tax owed but may also include among other thing penalty interest and attorney fee to date the majority of the taxing jurisdiction in which we facilitate travel reservation have not asserted that tax are due and payable on our travel service with respect to taxing jurisdiction that have not initiated proceeding to date it is possible that they will do so in the future or that they will seek to amend their tax statute and seek to collect tax from only on prospective basis we face increased risk the level of our debt increase we have substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness and we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future including through public or private offering of debt security our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur may have significant consequence which could include requiring the dedication of significant portion of our cash flow from operation to service our indebtedness thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purpose including capital expenditure share repurchase and acquisition increased vulnerability to downturn in our business to competitive pressure and to adverse change in general economic and industry condition decreased ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditure acquisition share repurchase or other general corporate purpose and decreased flexibility when planning for or reacting to change in our business and industry our ability to make payment of principal of and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic condition industry cycle and financial business and other factor affecting our consolidated result of operation and financial condition many of which are beyond our control further we may not have access to equity or debt market or other source of financing or such financing may not be available to on commercially reasonable term to repay or refinance our debt it come due or in the case of our convertible note upon conversion if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from our operation in the future to service our debt we may be required to among other thing repatriate fund to the united state at substantial tax cost we are dependent on provider of accommodation rental car and airline ticket and on restaurant we rely on provider of accommodation rental car and airline ticket and on restaurant to make their service available to consumer through our arrangement with travel service provider generally do not require them to make available any specific quantity of accommodation reservation rental car or airline ticket or to make accommodation reservation rental car or airline ticket available in any geographic area for any particular route or at any particular price similarly our arrangement with restaurant generally do not require them to provide all of their available table and reservation to customer through during the course of our business we are in continuous dialog with our major travel service provider about the nature and extent of their participation in our service significant reduction on the part of any of our major travel service provider or provider that are particularly popular with consumer in their participation in our service for sustained period of time or their complete withdrawal could have material adverse effect on our business market share and result of operation to the extent any of those major or popular travel service provider ceased to participate in our service in favor of one of our competitor system or decided to require consumer to purchase service directly from them our business market share and result of operation could be harmed further consolidation among travel service provider increase the potential adverse effect of decision by any particular significant travel service provider such large hotel chain airline or rental car company to withdraw from or reduce it participation in our service also increase to the extent restaurant limit the availability of reservation through opentable consumer may not continue to use our service and or our revenue could be adversely affected especially if reservation during highly desirable time on high volume day are not made available through further kayak meta search service depends on access to information related to travel service pricing schedule availability and other related information from otas and travel service provider to attract consumer to obtain this information kayak maintains relationship with travel service provider and otas many of kayak agreement with travel service provider and otas are short term agreement that may be terminated on day notice to the extent otas or travel service provider no longer provide such information to kayak kayak ability to provide comprehensive travel service information to consumer could be diminished and it brand business and result of operation could be harmed to the extent consumer do not view kayak reliable source of comprehensive travel service information fewer consumer would likely visit it website which would also likely have negative impact on kayak advertising revenue and result of operation in addition if travel service provider or otas choose not to advertise with kayak or choose to reduce or eliminate the fee paid to kayak for referral from query result kayak result of operation could be adversely affected we rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business would be harmed our performance is largely dependent on the talent and effort of highly skilled individual our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all area of our organization in particular the contribution of certain key senior management in the united state europe and asia are critical to the overall management of our business we may not be able to retain the service of any member of our senior management or other key employee the loss of whom could harm our business in addition competition for well qualified employee in all aspect of our business including software engineer mobile communication talent and other technology professional is intense both in the united state and abroad our international success in particular ha led to increased effort by our competitor and others to hire our international employee our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employee and to retain and motivate existing employee if we do not succeed in attracting well qualified employee or retaining and motivating existing employee our business would be adversely affected we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy the size of our business grows we may become increasingly subject to the scrutiny of anti trust and competition regulator in july the office of fair trading the oft the predecessor competition authority in the united kingdom to the competition and market authority cma issued statement of objection so to booking com which set the oft preliminary view on it believed booking com and others in the online accommodation reservation sector were allegedly in breach of and competition law the so alleged among other thing that there were agreement or concerted practice between accommodation and booking com and at least one other online travel company that restricted booking com and the other online travel company ability to discount hotel room reservation which the oft alleged wa form of resale price maintenance we dispute the allegation in the so booking com run an agency model accommodation reservation platform in which accommodation have complete discretion and control over setting the price that appear on the booking com website booking com is facilitator of accommodation room reservation it doe not take possession of or title to accommodation room and is not reseller of accommodation room because booking com play no role in price setting doe not control pricing and doe not resell accommodation room it doe not believe that it engages in the conduct alleged in the so on january the oft announced that it had accepted commitment offered by booking com well by expedia and intercontinental hotel group commitment to close the investigation on the basis that they address the oft competition concern the oft closed it investigation with no finding of

online travel company website such booking com under the commitment online travel company such booking com have the flexibility to discount hotel retail price but only to member of closed group concept that is defined in the commitment who have previously made reservation with the online travel company the discount may be up to booking com commission in addition the commitment provide that booking com will not require rate parity from hotel in relation to discounted rate that are provided by other online travel company or hotel to member of their closed group provided the discounted rate is not made public the commitment apply to booking by european economic area resident at hotel on march skyscanner meta search site based in the united kingdom filed an appeal in the competition appeal tribunal cat against the oft decision to accept the commitment booking com intervened in support of the cma in the cat in it decision dated september the cat found that the cma wa wrong to reject skyscanner argument about the negative impact of the commitment on it business and price transparency generally without properly exploring these argument the cat decision vacates the cma commitment decision and remit the matter to the cma for reconsideration in accordance with the cat ruling it is uncertain what action the cma will take in response to the cat ruling which could involve opening closing or suspending the investigation the cma did not appeal the cat decision many industry participant have been operating based on the substance of the commitment since they were adopted it is uncertain how the cat decision and any resulting action by the cma will affect industry practice including discounting to closed user group the status of rate parity clause found in many online travel company contract with hotel and other travel service provider and our business and result of operation the competition authority of many government have begun investigation into competitive practice within the online travel industry and we may be involved or affected by such investigation and their result in addition to the investigation discussed above national competition authority in the czech republic france germany italy austria hungary sweden ireland denmark and switzerland have opened investigation that focus on booking com rate parity clause in it contract with accommodation provider in those jurisdiction competition related inquiry have also been received from the competition authority in china we are in ongoing discussion with the relevant regulatory authority regarding their concern we are currently unable to predict the outcome of all of these investigation or how our business may be affected possible outcome include requiring booking com to remove it rate parity clause from it contract with accommodation provider in those jurisdiction and or the imposition of fine on december the french italian and swedish national competition authority working in close cooperation with the european commission announced their intention to seek public feedback on commitment offered by booking com in connection with investigation of booking com rate parity provision in it contractual arrangement with accommodation provider if the proposed commitment are accepted by the french italian and swedish competition authority the investigation in those country will be closed with no finding of infringement or admission of wrongdoing and no imposition of fine under the term of the proposed commitment booking com would replace it existing price parity agreement with accommodation provider sometimes also referred to most favored nation or mfn provision with narrow price parity agreement under the narrow price parity agreement an accommodation provider would still be required to offer the same or better rate on booking com it offered to consumer directly but it would no longer be required to offer the same or better rate on booking com it offered to other on line travel company if the commitment are accepted by the french italian and swedish competition authority after they have been market tested booking com will implement the commitment within six month of their being accepted we are currently unable to predict the outcome of the market test of the proposed commitment offered in france italy and sweden or the impact the proposed commitment in france italy and sweden will on the on going investigation in other european country or how our business may be affected by the proposed commitment if accepted we note that the german competition authority ha required hotel reservation service to remove it rate parity clause from it contract with hotel and hotel reservation service initial appeal wa denied to the extent that regulatory authority require change to our business practice or to those currently common to the industry our business competitive position and result of operation could be materially and adversely affected negative publicity regarding any such investigation could adversely affect our brand and therefore our market share and result of operation further our business grows we may increasingly become the target of such investigation or be limited by anti trust or competition law for example our size and market share may negatively affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval of proposed acquisition or our ability to expand into complementary business any of which could adversely affect our ability to grow and compete regulatory and legal requirement and uncertainty could harm our business the service we offer are subject to legal regulation including law ordinance rule and other requirement and regulation of national and local government and regulatory authority around the world many of which are evolving and subject to the possibility of new or revised interpretation our ability to provide our service is and will continue to be affected by such regulation for example law and proposed legislation relating to data localization in some country could adversely affect our ability to conduct business in those country the implementation of unfavorable regulation or unfavorable interpretation of existing regulation by judicial or regulatory body could require to incur significant compliance cost cause the development of the affected market to become impractical and otherwise have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation compliance with the law and regulation of multiple jurisdiction increase our cost of business these law and regulation which vary and sometimes conflict include the foreign corrupt practice act the bribery act and local law which also prohibit corrupt payment to governmental official or third party data privacy requirement labor relation law tax law anti trust or competition law or sanctioned country or sanctioned person mandate and consumer protection law violation of these law and regulation could result in fine and or criminal sanction against our officer or our employee and or prohibition on the conduct of our business any such violation could result in prohibition on our ability to offer our service in one or more country could delay or prevent potential acquisition and could also materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion effort our ability to attract and retain employee our business and our operating result in addition these restriction may provide competitive advantage to our competitor unless they are also subject to comparable restriction our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risk and manage these difficulty we are also subject to variety of other regulatory and legal risk and challenge in managing an organization operating in various country including those related to regulatory change or other government action additional complexity to comply with regulation in multiple jurisdiction well overlapping or inconsistent legal regime in particular with respect to tax labor consumer protection digital content advertising promotion privacy and anti trust law our ability to repatriate fund held by our non subsidiary to the united state at favorable tax rate difficulty in transferring fund from or converting currency in certain country and reduced protection for intellectual property right in some country our business ha grown substantially over the last several year and continues to expand into new geographic location in addition we have made effort and expect to make further effort to integrate access to travel service across our various brand these change add complexity to legal and tax compliance and our increased size and operating history may increase the likelihood that we will be subject to audit by tax authority in various jurisdiction cookie law could negatively impact the way we do business cookie is text file that is stored on user web browser by website cooky are common tool used by thousand of website including to among other thing store or gather information remember log on detail so user doe not have to re enter them when revisiting website market to consumer and enhance the user experience on website cooky are valuable tool for website like ours to improve the customer experience and increase conversion on their website the european union eprivacy directive requires member country to adopt regulation governing the use of cooky by website servicing consumer in the european union for example on june an amendment to the dutch telecommunication act became effective the amended act requires website including booking com to provide dutch user with clear and comprehensive information about the storage and use of certain cooky and obtain prior consent from the user before placing certain cooky on user web browser to the extent any such regulation require opt in consent before certain cooky can be placed on user web browser our ability in particular booking com ability to serve certain customer in the manner we currently do might be adversely affected and our ability to continue to improve and optimize performance on our website might be impaired either of which could negatively affect consumer experience using our service result these regulation could have material adverse effect on our business market share and result of operation our stock price is highly volatile the market price of our common stock is highly volatile and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuation in response to factor such the following some of which are beyond our control operating result that vary from the expectation of security analyst and investor quarterly variation in our operating result change in expectation to our future financial performance including financial estimate by security analyst and investor worldwide economic condition in general and in europe in particular fluctuation in currency exchange rate particularly between the dollar and the euro announcement of technological innovation or new service by or our competitor change in our capital structure change in market valuation of other internet or online service company announcement by or our competitor of price reduction promotion significant contract acquisition strategic partnership joint venture or capital commitment loss of major travel service provider participant such hotel chain rental car company or airline from our service change in the status of our intellectual property right lack of success in the expansion of our business model geographically announcement by third party of significant claim or initiation of litigation proceeding against or adverse development in pending proceeding occurrence of significant security breach addition or departure of key personnel and trading volume fluctuation of substantial number of share of our common stock including through the conversion of our convertible note could adversely affect the market price of our common stock by introducing large number of seller to the market given the volatility that exists for our share such sale could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly in addition fluctuation in our stock price and our price to earnings multiple may have made our stock attractive to momentum hedge or day trading investor who often shift fund into and out of stock rapidly exacerbating price fluctuation in either direction particularly when viewed on quarterly basis the trading price of internet company stock in general including ours have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuation to the extent that the public perception of the prospect of internet or commerce company is negative our stock price could decline regardless of our result other broad market and industry factor may decrease the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance market fluctuation well general political and economic condition such recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuation could cause our stock price to decline negative market condition could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital or the value of our stock for purpose of acquiring other company or business we have in the past been defendant in security class action litigation security class action litigation ha often been brought against company following period of volatility in the market price of it security to the extent our stock price decline or is volatile we may in the future be the target of additional litigation this additional litigation could result in substantial cost and divert management attention and resource either of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation we may not be able to keep up with rapid technological change the market in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standard consolidation frequent new service announcement introduction and enhancement and changing consumer demand we may not be able to keep up with these rapid change in addition these market characteristic are heightened by the progress of technology adoption in various market including the continuing adoption of the internet and online commerce in certain geography and the emergence and growth of the use of smart phone and tablet for mobile commerce transaction including through the increasing use of mobile apps result our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technology to adapt our service to evolving industry standard and to continually innovate and improve the performance feature and reliability of our service in response to competitive service offering and the evolving demand of the marketplace in particular we believe that it will be increasingly important for to effectively offer our service through mobile application and mobile optimized website on smart phone and tablet any failure by to successfully develop and achieve customer adoption of our mobile application and mobile optimized website would likely have material and adverse effect on our growth market share business and result of operation we believe that increasingly ease of use comprehensive functionality and the look and feel of our mobile apps and mobile optimized website will be competitively critical consumer obtain more of their travel and restaurant service through mobile device result we intend to continue to spend significant resource maintaining developing and enhancing our website including our mobile optimized website and our mobile apps and other technology in addition the widespread adoption of new internet networking or telecommunication technology or other technological change could require to incur substantial expenditure to modify or adapt our service or infrastructure to those new technology which could adversely affect our result of operation or financial condition for example kayak generates revenue in part by allowing consumer to compare search result that appear in additional pop under window change in browser functionality such change that either block or otherwise limit the use of pop under window at time ha had negative impact on our revenue any failure to implement or adapt to new technology in timely manner or at all could adversely affect our ability to compete increase our customer acquisition cost or otherwise adversely affect our business and therefore adversely affect our brand market share and result of operation we face risk related to our intellectual property we regard our intellectual property critical to our success and we rely on domain name trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality and or license agreement with our employee travel service provider partner and others to protect our proprietary right we have filed various application for protection of certain aspect of our intellectual property in the united state and other jurisdiction and we currently hold number of issued patent in multiple jurisdiction further in the future we may acquire additional patent or patent portfolio which could require significant cash expenditure however we may choose not to patent or otherwise register some of our intellectual property and instead rely on trade secret or other mean of protecting our intellectual property we have licensed in the past and may license in the future certain of our proprietary right such trademark or copyrighted material to third party and these licensee may take that diminish the value of our proprietary right or harm our reputation in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our service are made available online we may be required to expend significant time and resource to prevent infringement or to enforce our intellectual property right while we believe that our intellectual property right including our issued patent and pending patent application help to protect our business there can be no assurance that third party will not have or obtain one or more patent that can prevent from practicing feature of our business or that will require to pay for license to use those feature our operation do not or will not infringe valid enforceable patent of third party we can successfully defend our patent against challenge by third party pending patent application will result in the issuance of patent competitor or potential competitor will not devise new method of competing with that are not covered by our patent or patent application because of variation in the application of our business model to each of our service our patent will be effective in preventing one or more third party from utilizing copycat business model to offer the same service in one or more category new prior art will not be discovered that may diminish the value of or invalidate an issued patent or legislative or judicial action will not directly or indirectly affect the scope and validity of any of our patent right including the ability to obtain and enforce so called business method patent if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property it could have material adverse effect on our business brand and result of operation from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we have been subject to and are currently subject to legal proceeding and claim relating to the intellectual property right of others and we expect that third party will continue to assert intellectual property claim in particular patent claim against particularly we expand the complexity and scope of our business for example in february ibm sued and certain of our subsidiary asserting that we infringe certain ibm patent and claiming damage and injunctive relief while we believe the suit to be without merit and intend to contest it vigorously litigation is uncertain and we may not be successful we endeavor to defend our intellectual property right diligently but intellectual property litigation is extremely expensive and time consuming and may divert managerial attention and resource from our business objective successful infringement claim against could result in significant monetary liability or prevent from operating our business or portion of our business in addition resolution of claim may require to obtain license to use intellectual property right belonging to third party which may be expensive to procure or possibly to cease using those right altogether any of these event could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation or financial condition our use of open source software could adversely affect our ability to protect our proprietary software and subject to possible litigation we use open source software in connection with our software development from time to time company that use open source software have faced claim challenging the use of open source software and or compliance with open source license term we could be subject to suit by party claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming non compliance with open source licensing term some open source license require user who distribute software containing open source to make available all or part of such software which in some circumstance could include valuable proprietary code of the user while we monitor our use of open source software and try to ensure that none is used in manner that would require to disclose our proprietary source code or that would otherwise breach the term of an open source agreement such use could inadvertently occur in part because open source license term are often ambiguous any requirement to disclose our proprietary source code or pay damage for breach of contract could be harmful to our business result of operation or financial condition and could help our competitor develop service that are similar to or better than ours business is exposed to risk associated with processing credit card transaction our result have been negatively impacted by purchase made using fraudulent credit card because we act the merchant of record in majority of our priceline com transaction well those of agoda com and rentalcars com we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit card on our website well other payment dispute with our customer additionally we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit card in certain retail transaction when we do not act merchant of record accordingly we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting credit card chargebacks if we are unable to combat the use of fraudulent credit card on our website our business result of operation and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition in the event that one of our major travel service provider voluntarily or involuntarily declares bankruptcy we could experience an increase in credit card chargebacks from customer with travel reservation with such travel service provider for example airline that participate in our service and declare bankruptcy or cease operation may be unable or unwilling to honor ticket sold for their flight our policy in such event is to direct customer seeking refund or exchange to the airline and not to provide remedy ourselves because we are the merchant of record on sale of name your own price and express deal airline ticket to our customer however we could experience significant increase in demand for refund or credit card chargebacks from customer which could materially adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition for example in april aloha airline and ata airline each ceased operation and we experienced an increase in credit card chargebacks from customer with ticket on those airline agoda com and rentalcars com process credit card transaction and operate in numerous currency credit card cost are typically higher for foreign currency transaction and in instance where cancellation occur the success of our acquisition of opentable is subject to numerous risk and uncertainty on july we acquired opentable leading brand for booking online restaurant reservation we believe that the online restaurant reservation business is complementary to our online travel business and that both opentable and our travel business will benefit from adding opentable to the priceline group result of our acquisition of opentable we are subject to risk associated with opentable business many of which are the same risk that our other business face other risk include opentable ability to increase the number of restaurant and diner using it product and service and retain existing restaurant and diner competition both to provide reservation management service to restaurant and to attract diner to make reservation through opentable website and apps opentable ability to expand internationally opentable ability to effectively and efficiently market to new restaurant and diner and any risk that cause people to refrain from dining at restaurant such economic downturn severe weather outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease or threat of terrorist attack if opentable is unsuccessful in profitably growing it global online restaurant reservation business or it experience significant reduction in revenue due to factor such competition increased capital expenditure or investment we make in growing opentable business in particular internationally or any other reason the value of our investment in opentable may be adversely affected and we may incur an impairment charge related to goodwill investment in new business strategy and acquisition could disrupt our ongoing business and present risk not originally contemplated we have invested and in the future may invest in new business strategy and acquisition such endeavor may involve significant risk and uncertainty including distraction of management from current operation greater than expected liability and expense inadequate return on capital and unidentified issue not discovered in our investigation and evaluation of those strategy and acquisition we may decide to make minority investment including through joint venture in which we have limited or no management or operational control the controlling person in such case may have business interest strategy or goal that are inconsistent with ours and decision of the company or venture in which we invested may result in harm to our reputation or adversely affect the value of our investment further we may issue share of our common stock in these transaction which could result in dilution to our stockholder

to accommodate any further expansion of corporate operation item legal proceeding competition reviewsin july the office of fair trading the oft the predecessor competition authority in the united kingdom to the competition and market authority cma issued statement of objection so to booking com which set out the oft preliminary view on why it believed booking com and others in the online hotel reservation industry were allegedly in breach of and competition law the so alleged among other thing that there were agreement or concerted practice between hotel and booking com and between hotel and at least one other otc that restricted booking com and the other otc ability to discount hotel room reservation which the oft alleged wa form of resale price maintenance we dispute the allegation in the so on january the oft announced that it had accepted commitment offered by booking com well expedia and intercontinental hotel group the commitment to close the investigation on the basis that they address the oft competition concern the oft closed it investigation with no finding of infringement or admission of wrongdoing and no imposition of fine the commitment provide among other thing that hotel will continue to be able to set retail price for hotel room reservation on all otc website such booking com under the commitment otcs such booking com have the flexibility to discount hotel retail price but only to member of closed group concept that is defined in the commitment who have previously made reservation through the otc the discount may be up to booking com commission in addition the commitment provide that booking com will not require rate parity from hotel in relation to discounted rate that are provided by other otcs or hotel to member of their closed group provided the discounted rate is not made public the commitment apply to booking by european economic area resident at hotel on march skyscanner meta search site based in the united kingdom filed an appeal in the competition appeal tribunal cat against the oft decision to accept the commitment booking com intervened in support of the cma in the cat in it decision dated september the cat found that the cma wa wrong to reject skyscanner argument about the negative impact of the commitment on it business and price transparency generally without properly exploring these argument the cat decision vacates the cma commitment decision and remit the matter to the cma for reconsideration in accordance with the cat ruling the cma did not appeal the cat decision it is uncertain what action the cma will take in response to the cat ruling which could involve re opening closing or suspending the investigation investigation have also been opened by the national competition authority in the czech republic france germany italy austria hungary sweden ireland denmark and switzerland that focus on booking com rate parity clause in it contract with accommodation provider in those jurisdiction competition related inquiry have also been received from the competition authority in china we are in ongoing discussion with the relevant regulatory authority regarding their concern we are currently unable to predict the outcome of these investigation or how our business may be affected possible outcome include requiring booking com to amend or remove it rate parity clause from it contract with accommodation provider in those jurisdiction and or the imposition of fine on december the french italian and swedish national competition authority working in close cooperation with the european commission announced their intention to seek public feedback on commitment offered by booking com in connection with investigation of booking com rate parity provision in it contractual arrangement with accommodation provider if the proposed commitment are accepted by the french italian and swedish competition authority the investigation in those country will be closed with no finding of infringement or admission of wrongdoing and no imposition of fine under the term of the proposed commitment booking com would replace it existing price parity agreement with accommodation provider sometimes also referred to most favored nation or mfn provision with narrow price parity agreement under the narrow price parity agreement an accommodation provider would still be required to offer the same or better rate on booking com it offered to consumer directly but it would no longer be required to offer the same or better rate on booking com it offered to other on line travel company if the commitment are accepted by the french italian and swedish competition authority after they have been market tested booking com will implement the commitment within six month of their being accepted we are currently unable to predict the outcome of the market test of the proposed commitment offered in france italy and sweden or the impact the proposed commitment in france italy and sweden will have on the on going investigation in other european country or how our business may be affected by the proposed commitment if accepted we note that the german competition authority ha required hotel reservation service to remove it rate parity clause from it contract with hotel and hotel reservation service initial appeal wa denied to the extent that authority require change to our business practice or to those currently common to the industry our business competitive position and result of operation could be materially and adversely affected negative publicity regarding any such investigation could adversely affect our brand and therefore our market share and result of operation lawsuit alleging antitrust violationson august one complaint wa filed on behalf of putative class of person who purchased hotel room reservation from certain hotel the hotel defendant through certain otc defendant including the initial complaint turik expedia inc case no cv filed in the district court for the northern district of california alleged that the hotel defendant and the otc defendant violated federal and state law by entering into conspiracy to enforce minimum resale price maintenance scheme pursuant to which putative class member paid inflated price for hotel room reservation that they purchased through the otc defendant thirty one other complaint containing similar allegation were filed in number of federal jurisdiction across the country plaintiff in these action sought treble damage and injunctive relief the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation jpml consolidated all of the pending case under before judge boyle in the district court for the northern district of texas on may an amended consolidated complaint wa filed on february judge boyle dismissed the amended consolidated complaint without prejudice on october the court denied plaintiff motion for leave to file proposed second consolidated amended complaint and on october the court issued final judgment dismissing the case with prejudice the time to appeal the court october decision ha expired and the matter is closed litigation related to travel transaction tax we and certain third party online travel company otcs are currently involved in approximately forty lawsuit including certified and putative class action brought by or against state city and county over issue involving the payment of travel transaction tax hotel occupancy tax excise tax sale tax etc our subsidiary priceline com llc lowestfare com llc and travelweb llc are named in some but not all of these case generally the complaint allege among other thing that the otcs violated each jurisdiction respective relevant travel transaction tax ordinance with respect to the charge and remittance of amount to cover tax under each law the complaint typically seek compensatory damage disgorgement penalty available by law attorney fee and other relief in addition approximately seventy nine municipality or county and at least eleven state have initiated audit proceeding including proceeding initiated by more than forty municipality in california which have been inactive for several year issued proposed tax assessment or started inquiry relating to the payment of travel transaction tax additional state and local jurisdiction are likely to assert that we are subject to travel transaction tax and could seek to collect such tax retroactively and or prospectively with respect to the principal claim in these matter we believe that the law at issue do not apply to the service we provide namely the facilitation of travel reservation and therefore that we do not owe the tax that are claimed to be owed rather we believe that the law at issue generally impose travel transaction tax on entity that own operate or control hotel or similar business or furnish or provide hotel room or similar accommodation or other travel service in addition in many of these matter the taxing jurisdiction have asserted claim for conversion essentially that we have collected tax and wrongfully pocketed those tax dollar claim that we believe is without basis and have vigorously contested the taxing jurisdiction that are currently involved in litigation and other proceeding with and that may be involved in future proceeding have asserted contrary position and will likely continue to do so from time to time we have found it expedient to settle and may in the future agree to settle claim pending in these matter without conceding that the claim at issue are meritorious or that the claimed tax are in fact due to be paid in connection with some of these tax audit and assessment we may be required to pay any assessed tax which amount may be substantial prior to being allowed to contest the assessment and the applicability of the law in judicial proceeding this requirement is commonly referred to pay to play or pay first for example the city and county of san francisco assessed the company approximately million an amount that includes interest and penalty relating to hotel occupancy tax which the company paid in july and issued second assessment totaling approximately million which the company paid in january payment of these amount if any is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such tax in the san francisco action for example the court ruled in february that we and otcs do not owe transient accommodation tax to the city and ordered the city to refund the amount paid in july we also are seeking refund of the amount paid in january san francisco ha appealed the court ruling and ha not refunded the amount paid july pending resolution of the appeal the matter ha been stayed while the appeal in another case with the city of san diego is pending before the california supreme court litigation is subject to uncertainty and there could be adverse development in these pending or future case and proceeding for example in january the tax appeal court for the state of hawaii held that we and other otcs are not liable for the state transient accommodation tax but held that the otcs including are liable for the state general excise tax on the full amount the otc collect from the customer for hotel room reservation without any offset for amount passed through to the hotel we recorded an accrual for travel transaction tax including estimated interest and penalty with corresponding charge to cost of revenue of approximately million in december and approximately million in the three month ended march primarily related to this ruling during the year ended december and december we paid approximately million and million respectively to the state of hawaii related to this ruling we have filed an appeal now pending before the hawaii supreme court other adverse ruling include decision in september in which the superior court in the district of columbia granted summary judgment in favor of the district and against the otcs ruling that tax is due on the otcs margin and service fee which we are appealing result we increased our accrual for travel transaction tax including estimated interest with corresponding charge to cost of revenue by approximately million in september and by approximately million in the three month ended march also in july the circuit court of cook county illinois ruled that we and the other otcs are liable for tax and other obligation under the chicago hotel accommodation tax in july we resolved all claim in this case through settlement and the claim against were dismissed on september in addition in october jury in san antonio class action found that we and the other otcs that are defendant in the lawsuit control hotel for purpose of the local hotel occupancy tax ordinance at issue and are therefore subject to the requirement of those ordinance we intend to vigorously appeal the trial court judgment when it becomes final an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending litigation may encourage the commencement of additional litigation audit proceeding or other regulatory inquiry and also could result in substantial liability for past and or future booking including among other thing interest penalty punitive damage and or attorney fee and cost there have been and will continue to be substantial ongoing cost which may include pay first payment associated with defending our position in pending and any future case or proceeding an adverse outcome in one or more of these unresolved proceeding could have material adverse effect on our business and could be material to our result of operation or cash flow in any given operating period however we believe that even if we were to suffer adverse determination in the near term in more of the pending proceeding than currently anticipated given result to date it would not have material impact on our liquidity because of our available cash to the extent that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that our service are subject to travel transaction tax and that we have tax collection responsibility for those tax or we determine that we have such responsibility with respect to future transaction we may collect any such additional tax obligation from our customer which would have the effect of increasing the cost of travel reservation to our customer and consequently could make our travel reservation service le competitive compared to the service of other otcs or travel service provider and reduce our travel reservation transaction alternatively we could choose to reduce the compensation for our service either action could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation in many of the judicial and other proceeding initiated to date the taxing jurisdiction seek not only historical tax that are claimed to be owed on our gross profit but also among other thing interest penalty punitive damage and or attorney fee and cost therefore any liability associated with travel transaction tax matter is not constrained to our liability for tax owed on it historical gross profit but may also include among other thing penalty interest and attorney fee to date the majority of the taxing jurisdiction in which we facilitate hotel reservation have not asserted that these tax are due and payable with respect to taxing jurisdiction that have not initiated proceeding to date it is possible that they will do so in the future or that they will seek to amend their tax statute and seek to collect tax from only on prospective basis accrual for travel transaction tax result of this litigation and other attempt by jurisdiction to levy similar tax we have established an accrual including estimated interest and penalty for the potential resolution of issue related to travel transaction tax in the amount of approximately million at december compared to approximately million at december our legal expense for these matter are expensed incurred and are not reflected in the amount accrued the actual cost may be le or greater potentially significantly than the liability recorded an estimate for reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount accrued can not be reasonably made intend to vigorously defend against the claim in all of the proceeding described below statewide class action and putative class actionssuch action include city of los angeles california hotel

result may differ materially from the result discussed in the forward looking statement factor that might cause those difference include those discussed in risk factor and elsewhere in this annual report on form overview we are leading provider of online travel and travel related reservation and search service through our online travel agent ota service we connect consumer wishing to make travel reservation with provider of travel service around the world we offer consumer accommodation reservation including hotel bed and breakfast hostel apartment vacation rental and other property through our booking com priceline com and agoda com brand our priceline com brand also offer consumer reservation for rental car airline ticket vacation package and cruise we offer rental car reservation worldwide through rentalcars com we also allow consumer to easily compare airline ticket hotel reservation and rental car reservation information from hundred of travel website at once through kayak we recently acquired opentable leading provider of online restaurant reservation we believe that the online restaurant reservation business is complementary to our online travel business and that both opentable and our travel business will benefit from adding opentable to the priceline group we refer to our company and all of our subsidiary and brand including booking com priceline com kayak agoda com rentalcars com and of july opentable collectively the priceline group the company we our or we launched our business in the united state in under the priceline com brand and have since expanded our operation to include booking com kayak agoda com rentalcars com and opentable which are independently managed and operated brand our principal goal is to serve consumer and our travel service provider and restaurant partner with worldwide leadership in online reservation service our business is driven primarily by international result which consist of the result of booking com agoda com and rentalcars com and the result of the internationally based website of kayak and of july opentable in each case regardless of where the consumer resides where the consumer is physically located while making reservation or the location of the travel service provider or restaurant during the year ended december our international business the substantial majority of which is generated by booking com represented approximately of our gross booking an operating and statistical metric referring to the total dollar value generally inclusive of all tax and fee of all travel service purchased by our customer and approximately of our consolidated operating income see note to the consolidated financial statement for more geographic information significant majority of our gross profit is earned in connection with facilitating accommodation reservation we derive substantially all of our gross profit from the following source commission earned from facilitating reservation of accommodation rental car cruise and other travel service transaction gross profit and customer processing fee from our accommodation rental car airline ticket and vacation package reservation service advertising revenue primarily earned by kayak from sending referral to otas and travel service provider well from advertising placement on kayak website and mobile apps beginning on july revenue recognized by opentable which consist of reservation revenue fee for restaurant guest seated through opentable online reservation service subscription fee for restaurant reservation management service and other revenue and global distribution system gd reservation booking fee related to our name your own price hotel rental car and airline ticket reservation service and price disclosed airline ticket and rental car reservation service our priceline com brand offer merchant name your own price opaque travel service which are recorded in revenue on gross basis and have associated cost of revenue all of our other service are recorded in revenue on net basis and have no associated cost of revenue therefore revenue increase and decrease are impacted by change in the mix of our revenue between name your own price travel service and other service gross profit reflects the commission or net margin earned for our retail name your own price and semi opaque travel service and our advertising and other service consequently gross profit is an important measure to evaluate growth in our business because in contrast to our revenue it is not affected by different method of recording revenue and cost of revenue between our name your own price travel service and our other service trendsover the last several year we have experienced strong growth in our accommodation reservation service we believe this growth is the result of among other thing the broader shift of travel purchase from offline to online the widespread adoption of mobile device the high growth of travel overall in emerging market such asia pacific and south america and the continued innovation and execution by our team around the world to build accommodation supply content and distribution and to improve the customer experience on our website and mobile apps these year over year growth rate have generally decelerated in recent year for example for the year ended december our accommodation room night reservation growth wa deceleration from in in and in given the size of our hotel reservation business we expect that our year over year growth rate will continue to decelerate though the rate of deceleration may fluctuate the size of the travel market outside of the united state is substantially greater than that within the united state historically internet use and commerce activity of international consumer have trailed that of consumer in the united state however international consumer are rapidly moving to online mean for purchasing travel accordingly recent international online travel growth rate have substantially exceeded and are expected to continue to exceed the growth rate within the united state we expect that over the long term international online travel growth rate will follow similar trend to that experienced in the united state in addition the base of hotel property in europe and asia is particularly fragmented compared to that in the united state where the hotel market is dominated by large hotel chain we believe online reservation system like ours may be more appealing to small chain and independent hotel more commonly found outside of the united state our growth ha primarily been generated by our international accommodation reservation service brand booking com and agoda com booking com our most significant brand included over property on it website of february which included over vacation rental property updated property count are available on the booking com website booking com ha added property over the past year in it core european market well higher growth market such north america which is newer market for booking com asia pacific and south america an increasing amount of our business from both destination and point of sale perspective is conducted in our newer market which are growing faster than our overall growth rate we believe that the opportunity to continue to grow our business exists for the market in which we operate we believe these trend and factor have enabled to become the leading online accommodation reservation service provider in the world measured by room night booked our international business represents the substantial majority of our financial result we expect to continue to see our operating result and other financial metric largely driven by international performance for example certain market in which we operate that are in earlier stage of development have lower operating margin compared to more mature market which could have negative impact on our overall margin these market increase in size over time also we intend to continue to invest in adding accommodation available for reservation on our website including hotel bed and breakfast hostel and vacation rental vacation rental generally consist of among others property categorized single unit and multi unit villa apartment aparthotels which are apartment with front desk and cleaning service and chalet and are generally self catered include kitchen directly bookable property many of the newer accommodation we add to our travel reservation service especially in highly penetrated market may have fewer room lower average daily rate adrs or higher credit risk and may appeal to smaller subset of consumer hostel and bed and breakfast and therefore may also negatively impact our margin for example because vacation rental is either single unit or small collection of independent unit vacation rental property represent more limited booking opportunity than non vacation rental property which generally have more unit to rent per property our non hotel accommodation in general may be subject to increased seasonality due to local tourism season weather or other factor we increase our non hotel accommodation business these different market characteristic could negatively impact our profit margin and to the extent these property represent an increasing percentage of the property added to our website our gross booking growth rate and property growth rate will likely diverge over time since each such property ha fewer booking opportunity result of the foregoing the percentage of non hotel accommodation increase the number of reservation per property will likely decrease in addition non hotel accommodation including vacation rental tend to be more seasonal in nature and may close during off season which impact our property count quarter to quarter concern persist about the outlook for the global economy in general and the european union in particular with recent decline in broad eurozone economic indicator raising fear about the pace of economic growth and the risk of deflation in addition many government around the world including the government and certain european government continue to operate at large financial deficit resulting in high level of sovereign debt in such country greece ireland portugal and certain other european union country with high level of sovereign debt at time have had difficulty refinancing debt failure to reach political consensus regarding workable solution to these issue ha resulted in high level of uncertainty regarding the future economic outlook this uncertainty well concern over governmental austerity measure including higher tax and reduced government spending could impair consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand at time we have experienced volatility in transaction growth rate and weaker trend in hotel adrs across many region of the world particularly in those european country that appear to be most affected by economic uncertainty we believe that these business trend are likely impacted by weak economic condition and sovereign debt concern disruption in the economy of such country could cause contribute to or be indicative of deteriorating macro economic condition greece newly elected government which campaigned against austerity measure may not be able to reach an acceptable solution to the country debt crisis with the european union this may increase the likelihood that greece and in turn other country could exit the european union which could lead to added economic uncertainty and further devaluation or eventual abandonment of the euro common currency these and other macro economic uncertainty such sovereign default risk becoming more widespread declining oil price and geopolitical tension have led to significant volatility in the exchange rate between the euro the dollar and other currency the european central bank in an effort to stimulate the european economy recently launched quantitative easing program to purchase public debt which in turn ha caused the euro exchange rate to weaken compared to the dollar our international business represents substantial majority of our financial result during the year ended december our international business the substantial majority of which is generated by booking com represented approximately of our gross booking an operating and statistical metric referring to the total dollar value generally inclusive of all tax and fee of all travel service purchased by our customer and approximately of our consolidated operating income therefore because we report our result in dollar we face exposure to adverse movement in currency exchange rate the financial result of our international business are translated from local currency principally the euro and the british pound sterling into dollar the dollar significantly strengthened against the euro during moving from an exchange rate of dollar per euro of january to dollar per euro of january the dollar also strengthened significantly during this time frame compared to many other currency result our foreign currency denominated net asset gross booking gross profit operating expense and net income have been negatively impacted expressed in dollar for example gross profit from our international operation grew year over year on local currency basis by approximately for the three month ended december but result of the impact of change in currency exchange rate grew reported in dollar the dollar significantly strengthened against the euro during moving from an exchange rate of dollar per euro of january to dollar per euro of december the dollar strengthened further in january to an exchange rate of dollar per euro of january the dollar ha also strengthened against many other currency since january at these exchange rate the growth of our total and international gross booking expressed in dollar will be significantly adversely impacted in we generally enter into derivative instrument to minimize the impact of short term currency fluctuation on our consolidated operating result however such derivative instrument are short term in nature and not designed to hedge against currency fluctuation that could impact our gross booking revenue or gross profit see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information on our derivative contract significant fluctuation in currency exchange rate can also impact consumer travel behavior for example recent dramatic depreciation of the russian ruble ha resulted in it becoming more expensive for russian to travel to europe and most other non ruble destination consumer traveling from country whose currency ha weakened against other currency may book lower adr accommodation choose to shorten or cancel their international travel plan or choose to travel domestically rather than internationally any of which could adversely affect our gross booking revenue and result of operation in particular when expressed in dollar the uncertainty of macro economic factor the volatility in foreign exchange rate and their impact on consumer behavior which may differ across region make it more difficult to forecast industry and consumer trend and the timing and degree of their impact on our market and business which in turn could adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our business and adversely affect our result of operation we compete with both online and traditional travel and travel related reservation and search service the market for the travel reservation and search service we offer is intensely competitive trend we expect to continue and current and new competitor can launch new service at relatively low cost we currently or potentially may in the future compete with variety of company including online travel reservation service such those owned by expedia orbitz which ha agreed to be acquired by expedia ctrip rakuten edreams odigeo and jalan online accommodation search and or reservation service such homeaway and airbnb focused on vacation rental property including individually owned property large online company including search social networking and marketplace company such google facebook alibaba amazon and groupon traditional travel agency wholesaler and tour operator such carlson wagonlit american express thomas cook and tui travel well thousand of individual travel agency around the world travel service provider such accommodation provider rental car company and airline online travel search and price comparison service generally referred to meta search service such tripadvisor trivago in which expedia ha acquired majority ownership interest qunar and hotelscombined and online restaurant reservation service such tripadvisor lafourchette and yelp seatme for more detail regarding the competitive trend and risk we face see part item business competition and part item risk factor intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance and recent trend in consumer adoption and use of mobile device create new challenge and may enable device company such apple to compete directly with after entering into an exclusive long term strategic marketing agreement in august expedia acquired travelocity in january on february expedia announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire orbitz to the extent these acquisition enhance expedia ability to compete with in particular in the united state which is expedia travelocity and orbitz largest market our market share and result of operation could be adversely affected widespread adoption of mobile device such the iphone android enabled smart phone and tablet such the ipad coupled with the improved web browsing functionality and development of thousand of useful apps available on these device is driving substantial online traffic and commerce to mobile platform we have experienced significant shift of business to mobile platform and our advertising partner are also seeing rapid shift of traffic to mobile platform our major competitor and certain new market entrant are offering mobile application for travel product and other mobile functionality including proprietary last minute discount for accommodation reservation advertising and distribution opportunity may be more limited on mobile device given their smaller screen size the gross profit earned on mobile transaction may be le than typical desktop transaction due to different consumer purchasing pattern for example accommodation reservation made on mobile device typically are for shorter length of stay and are not made far in advance further given the device size and technical limitation of tablet and smart phone mobile consumer may not be willing to download multiple apps from multiple company providing similar service and instead prefer to use one or limited number of apps for their mobile travel and restaurant research and reservation activity result the consumer experience with mobile apps well brand recognition and loyalty are likely to become increasingly important our mobile offering have received strong review and achieved solid download trend and are driving material and increasing share of our business we believe that mobile booking present an opportunity for growth and are necessary to maintain and grow our business consumer increasingly turn to mobile device instead of personal computer and to mobile application in addition to web browser if we are unable to continue to rapidly innovate and create new user friendly and differentiated mobile offering and efficiently and effectively advertise and distribute on these platform or if our mobile apps are not downloaded and used by consumer we could lose market share to existing competitor or new entrant and our future growth and result of operation could be adversely affected in addition we have observed an increase in promotional pricing to closed user group such loyalty program participant or customer with registered account including through mobile apps if we are not effective our competition in offering discounted price to closed user group or if we are unable to entice member of our competitor closed user group to use our service our ability to grow and compete could be harmed further growth in discounted closed user group retail price for hotel room lessens the price difference for member of closed user group between retail hotel reservation and an opaque hotel reservation which may lead to fewer consumer using our opaque hotel reservation service if we need to fund discount out of our gross profit our profitability could be adversely affected we have established widely used and recognized commerce brand through aggressive marketing and promotional campaign result both our online and offline advertising expense ha increased significantly in recent year trend we expect to continue during our total online advertising expense wa approximately billion substantial portion of wa spent internationally through internet search engine primarily google meta search and travel research service and affiliate marketing we also invested million in offline advertising we intend to continue strategy of aggressively promoting brand awareness primarily through online mean although we also intend to increase our offline advertising effort including by expanding offline campaign into additional market for example building on it first offline advertising campaign which it launched in the united state in booking com ha begun offline advertising campaign in other market including australia canada the united kingdom and germany we have observed increased offline advertising by otas meta search service and travel service provider particularly in north america and europe which may make our offline advertising effort more expensive and le effective online advertising efficiency expressed online advertising percentage of gross profit is impacted by number of factor that are subject to variability and that are in some case outside of our control including adrs cost per click cancellation rate foreign exchange rate our ability to convert paid traffic to booking customer and the extent to which consumer come directly to our website or mobile apps for booking for example competition for desired ranking in search result and or decline in ad click by consumer could increase our cost per click and reduce our online advertising efficiency from to our online advertising grew faster than our gross profit due to year over year decline in online advertising return on investment roi and brand mix within the priceline group our international brand grew faster than our brand and spent higher percentage of gross profit on online advertising in these long term trend were more than offset by the inclusion of kayak and opentable because they spend lower percentage of gross profit on online advertising than our other brand also our consolidated result exclude intercompany advertising by our brand on kayak since our acquisition of kayak in may if google change how it present travel search result or the manner in which it conduct the auction for placement among search result in manner that is competitively disadvantageous to whether to support it own travel related service or otherwise our ability to efficiently generate traffic to our website could be harmed see part item risk factor we rely on online advertising channel to enhance our brand awareness and to generate significant amount of traffic to our website and our business could be negatively affected by change in internet search engine algorithm and dynamic or traffic generating arrangement the competition authority of many government have begun investigation into competitive practice within the online travel industry and we may be involved or affected by such investigation and their result for example booking com ha been the subject of competition investigation by competition authority since july other national competition authority including those in the czech republic france germany italy austria hungary sweden and switzerland have more recently opened investigation that focus on booking com rate parity clause in it contract with accommodation provider in those jurisdiction we are currently unable to predict the outcome of all of these investigation or how our business may be affected possible outcome include requiring booking com to remove it rate parity clause from it contract with accommodation provider in those jurisdiction in the investigation booking com and the other subject of the investigation had reached settlement with the competition authority however that settlement ha been vacated on appeal on december the french italian and swedish national competition authority working in close cooperation with the european commission announced their intention to seek public feedback on commitment offered by booking com in connection with investigation of booking com rate parity provision in it contractual arrangement with accommodation provider see footnote to our consolidated financial statement and part item risk factor the size of our business grows we may become increasingly subject to the scrutiny of anti trust and competition regulator we note that the german competition authority ha required hotel reservation service leading ota in germany to remove it rate parity clause from it contract with hotel and hotel reservation service initial appeal wa denied to the extent that regulatory authority require change to our business practice or to those currently common to the industry our business competitive position and result of operation could be materially and adversely affected negative publicity regarding any such investigation could adversely affect our brand and therefore our market share and result of operation hotel typically make available only limited number of hotel room for opaque service like ours especially during period of high occupancy result recent high hotel occupancy level in the united state have had an adverse impact on our access to hotel room for our opaque hotel reservation service which ha negatively affected our opaque hotel reservation gross profit seasonalitya meaningful amount of gross booking are generated early in the year customer plan and reserve their spring and summer vacation in europe and north america from cost perspective we expense the substantial majority of our advertising activity the expense is incurred which is typically in the quarter in which reservation are booked however we generally do not recognize associated revenue until future quarter when the travel occurs result we typically experience our highest level of profitability in the second and third quarter of the year which is when we experience the highest level of accommodation checkout for the year for our european and north american business addition the date on which certain holiday fall can have an impact on our quarterly result for example in our second quarter year over year growth rate in revenue gross profit operating income and operating margin were adversely affected by easter falling in the first quarter instead of the second quarter it did in conversely our second quarter year over year growth rate in revenue gross profit operating income and operating margin were favorably impacted by easter falling in the second quarter instead of the first quarter it did in the impact of seasonality can be exaggerated in the short term by the gross booking growth rate of the business for example in period where our growth rate substantially decelerates our operating margin typically benefit from relatively le variable advertising expense in addition gross profit growth is typically le impacted in the near term due to the benefit of revenue related to reservation booked in previous quarter we experience the highest level of booking and travel consumption for our asia pacific and south american business in the first and fourth quarter therefore if these business grow faster than our north american and european business our operating result for the first and fourth quarter of the year may become more significant over time percentage of full year operating result other factorswe believe that our future success depends in large part on our ability to continue to profitably grow our brand worldwide and over time to offer other travel and travel related service and further expand into other international market factor beyond our control such worldwide recession oil price terrorist attack unusual weather pattern natural disaster such earthquake hurricane tsunami flood and volcanic eruption travel related health concern including pandemic and epidemic such ebola influenza avian bird flu and sars political instability regional hostility imposition of tax or surcharge by regulatory authority or travel related accident could adversely affect our business and result of operation and impair our ability to effectively implement all or some of the initiative described above for example in late hurricane sandy disrupted travel in the northeastern united state in early japan wa struck by major earthquake tsunami and nuclear emergency in october severe flooding in thailand key market for our agoda com business and the asian business of booking com negatively impacted booking volume and cancellation rate in this market in addition thailand ha recently experienced disruptive civil unrest which ha negatively impacted booking volume and cancellation rate in this market in early thailand also experienced civil unrest which caused the temporary relocation of agoda com thailand based operation future natural disaster health concern or civil or political unrest could further disrupt our business and operation we intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotion technology and personnel within parameter consistent with attempt to improve long term operating result even if those expenditure create pressure on operating margin we have experienced pressure on operating margin we prioritize initiative that drive growth we also intend to broaden the scope of our business and to that end we explore strategic alternative from time to time in the form of among other thing merger and acquisition our goal is to grow gross profit and achieve healthy operating margin in an effort to maintain profitability the uncertain environment described above make the prediction of future result of operation difficult and accordingly we may not be able to sustain gross profit growth and profitability on july we acquired opentable leading provider of online restaurant reservation for billion billion net of cash acquired and on may we acquired kayak software corporation leading travel meta search service for billion billion net of cash acquired substantial portion of the total consideration for these acquisition related to identifiable acquired intangible and goodwill see note to the consolidated financial statement in we intend to invest in opentable to accelerate it global expansion increase the value offered to it restaurant partner and enhance the end to end experience for customer across desktop and mobile device result we expect opentable profitability in to decline year over year we invest for future growth if the investment we intend to make in and beyond in particular internationally are unsuccessful in growing opentable global online restaurant reservation business or opentable experience significant reduction in revenue or profitability due to factor such competition increased capital expenditure or investment in it business we may incur an impairment likewise if kayak is unsuccessful in profitably growing it global online travel brand or it experience significant reduction in advertising revenue on it website or mobile apps or profitability due to factor such loss of continued access to travel service information provided by other otas or travel service provider we may incur an impairment accounting policy and estimatesmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation is based upon our consolidated financial statement which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state our significant accounting policy and estimate are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statement certain of our accounting policy and estimate are particularly important to our financial position and result of operation and require to make difficult and subjective judgment often result of the need to make estimate of matter that are inherently uncertain in applying those policy our management us it judgment to determine the appropriate assumption to be used in the determination of certain estimate on an on going basis we evaluate our estimate including those related to the item described below those estimate are based on among other thing historical experience term of existing contract our observance of trend in the travel industry and on various other assumption that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance our actual result may differ from these estimate under different assumption or condition our significant accounting policy that involve significant estimate and judgment of management include the following accounting for travel transaction tax discussed in note to the consolidated financial statement we are currently involved in approximately forty lawsuit brought by or against state city and county over issue involving the payment of travel transaction tax hotel occupancy tax excise tax sale tax etc in addition over seventy nine municipality or county and at least eleven state have initiated audit proceeding issued proposed tax assessment or started inquiry relating to the payment of travel transaction tax additional state and local jurisdiction are likely to assert that we are subject to travel transaction tax and could seek to collect such tax retroactively and or prospectively historically we have not collected travel transaction tax on the gross profit earned from merchant hotel transaction however in handful of jurisdiction we have been required recently by passage of new statute or by court order to start collecting and remitting certain tax local occupancy and or sale or excise tax imposed upon our margin and or service fee or in the case of hawaii on the full amount collected from the consumer the ultimate resolution of these matter in all jurisdiction can not be determined at this time we have established an accrual including estimated interest and penalty for potential resolution of issue related to travel transaction tax for prior and current period consistent with applicable accounting principle and in light of all current fact and circumstance we accrue for legal contingency where it is probable that loss ha occurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated our legal expense for these matter are expensed incurred and are not reflected in the amount accrued variety of factor could affect the amount of the liability both past and future which factor include but are not limited to the number of and amount of gross profit represented by jurisdiction that ultimately assert claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate settlement and change in relevant statute the ultimate resolution of these matter may be greater or le than the liability recorded stock based compensation we record stock based compensation expense for equity based award over the recipient service period based upon the grant date fair value of the award number of our equity award have performance target performance contingency which if satisfied can increase the number of share issued to the recipient at the end of the performance period or in certain instance if not satisfied reduce the number of share issued to the recipient sometimes to zero at the end of the performance period the performance period for our performance based equity award are typically three year we record stock based compensation expense for these performance based award based upon our estimate of the probable outcome at the end of the performance period the estimated performance against the performance target we periodically adjust the cumulative stock based compensation recorded when the probable outcome for these performance based award is updated based upon change in actual and forecasted operating result stock based compensation for the year ended december and includes charge amounting to million million and million respectively representing the impact of adjusting the estimated probable outcome of unvested performance share unit our actual performance against the performance target could differ materially from our estimate we record stock based compensation expense net of estimated forfeiture in determining the estimated forfeiture rate we periodically review actual forfeiture to the extent that actual forfeiture rate differ from current estimate such amount are recorded cumulative adjustment in the period in which the estimate is revised valuation of goodwill long lived asset and intangible the application of the purchase method of accounting for business combination requires the use of significant estimate and assumption to determine fair value of the asset and liability assumed in order to properly allocate the purchase price consideration between identifiable intangible asset from goodwill our estimate of the fair value of asset and liability assumed are based upon assumption that we believe are reasonable and when appropriate include assistance from third party valuation firm goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment excluding opentable which wa acquired in july the estimated fair value of our other reporting unit substantially exceed their respective carrying value since the annual impairment test in september there have been no event or change in circumstance to indicate potential impairment additionally we evaluate whether event or circumstance have occurred which indicate that the carrying amount of long lived asset and intangible may be impaired the significant factor that are considered that could trigger an impairment review include change in business strategy market condition or the manner of use of an asset under performance relative to historical or expected future operating result and negative industry or economic trend in evaluating an asset for possible impairment management estimate that asset future undiscounted cash flow to measure whether the carrying value of the asset is recoverable if it is determined that the asset is not recoverable we measure the impairment based upon the fair value of the asset compared to it carrying value the fair value represents the projected discounted cash flow of the asset over it remaining life result of our recent acquisition of opentable and kayak in july and may respectively we have recorded significant amount of goodwill and identifiable intangible asset refer to note in the consolidated financial statement for additional information in we intend to invest in opentable to accelerate it global expansion increase the value offered to it restaurant partner and enhance the end to end experience for customer across desktop and mobile device result we expect opentable profitability in to decline year over year we invest for future growth if the investment we intend to make in and beyond in particular internationally are unsuccessful in growing opentable global online restaurant reservation business or opentable experience significant reduction in revenue or profitability due to factor such competition increased capital expenditure or investment in it business we may incur an impairment likewise if kayak is unsuccessful in profitably growing it global online travel brand or it experience significant reduction in advertising revenue on it website or mobile apps or profitability due to factor such loss of continued access to travel service information provided by other otas or travel service provider we may incur an impairment charge income tax we determine our tax expense based on our income and statutory tax rate applicable in the various jurisdiction in which we operate due to the complex nature of tax legislation and frequent change with such associated legislation significant judgment is required in computing our tax expense and determining our tax position we regularly review our deferred tax asset for recoverability considering historical profitability projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversal of temporary difference and tax planning strategy and record valuation allowance required we are subject to ongoing tax examination and assessment in various jurisdiction to date we have been audited in several taxing jurisdiction with no significant impact on our financial condition result of operation or cash flow although we believe that our tax filing position are reasonable the final determination of tax audit or tax dispute may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provision and accrual accordingly we may incur additional tax expense based upon our assessment of the more likely than not outcome or we may adjust previously recorded tax expense to reflect examination result we intend to reinvest our foreign earnings in our non operation at december and we had approximately billion and billion respectively of foreign earnings indefinitely reinvested it is not practicable to determine the federal income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not indefinitely reinvested recent accounting pronouncementsin may the financial accounting standard board fasb and the international accounting standard board iasb issued new accounting standard on the recognition of revenue from contract with customer that is designed to create greater comparability for financial statement user across industry and jurisdiction the core principle of the standard is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised good or service to customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those good or service additionally the new specifies the accounting for some cost to obtain or fulfill contract with customer the new standard will also require enhanced disclosure the accounting standard is effective for public entity for annual and interim period beginning after december early adoption is not permitted under gaap and retrospective application is permitted but not required we are currently evaluating the impact on it consolidated financial statement of adopting this new guidance in april the fasb issued an accounting update which amends the definition of discontinued operation the new definition limit discontinued operation reporting to disposal of component of an entity that represent strategic shift that have or will have major effect on an entity operation and financial result the new definition includes an acquired business that is classified held for sale at the date of acquisition the accounting update requires new disclosure of both discontinued operation and disposal of an individually significant component of an entity the accounting update is effective for annual and interim period beginning on or after december early adoption is permitted but only for disposal that have not been reported in financial statement previously issued we adopted this update in the first quarter of and this accounting update did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statement in july the fasb issued an accounting update which provides guidance on financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when net operating loss carryforward or tax credit carryforward exists in the same taxing jurisdiction per this guidance an entity must present the unrecognized tax benefit reduction to deferred tax asset except when the carryforward is not available of the reporting date under the governing tax law to settle tax or the entity doe not intend to use the deferred tax asset for this purpose this amendment doe not impact the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax position or the disclosure reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefit the update is effective for public company beginning after december we adopted this update in the first quarter of and this accounting update did not have an impact on the company consolidated balance sheet of operation year ended december compared to year ended december operating and statistical metric our financial result are driven by certain operating metric that encompass the booking and other business activity generated by our travel and travel related service specifically reservation of accommodation room night rental car day and airline ticket capture the volume of unit purchased by our travel reservation service customer gross booking is an operating and statistical metric that capture the total dollar value generally inclusive of tax and fee of all travel service booked by our customer and is widely used in the travel business international gross booking reflect gross booking generated principally by our booking com agoda com and rentalcars com business and domestic gross booking reflect gross booking generated principally by our priceline com business in each case regardless of where the consumer resides where the consumer is physically located while making reservation or the location of the travel service provider or restaurant we follow similar approach for reporting the international and domestic revenue and gross profit of those business gross booking resulting from accommodation room night rental car day and airline ticket reserved through our international and operation for the year ended december and were follows number may not total due to rounding year ended december in million changeinternational total gross booking increased by for the year ended december compared to the same period in growth on local currency basis wa approximately principally due to growth of in accommodation room night reservation growth on local currency basis in accommodation adrs growth of in rental car day reservation and growth in airline ticket reservation international gross booking grew by growth on local currency basis wa approximately for the year ended december compared to the year ended december primarily result of growth in accommodation room night reservation for our booking com and agoda com business well growth in rental car day reservation for our rentalcars com business the dollar significantly strengthened against the euro during moving from an exchange rate of dollar per euro of january to dollar per euro of december the dollar strengthened further in january to an exchange rate of dollar per euro of january the dollar ha also strengthened against many other currency since january at these exchange rate the growth of our total and international gross booking expressed in dollar will be significantly adversely impacted in we therefore believe that unit growth rate and total gross booking international gross booking and gross profit growth on local currency basis excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuation are important measure to understand the fundamental performance of the business domestic gross booking increased by for the year ended december compared to the year ended december primarily due to increase in priceline com retail airline ticket retail hotel express deal hotel and retail rental car service partially offset by decline in priceline com name your own price reservation service travel service provider typically provide limited amount of availability to opaque service like ours especially during period of healthy travel demand result the recent healthy travel environment in the united state ha had an adverse impace on our access to availability for our opaque reservation service gross booking resulting from reservation of accommodation room night rental car day and airline ticket made through our agency and merchant model for the year ended december and were follows number may not total due to rounding year ended december in million changeagency total agency gross booking increased for the year ended december compared to the year ended december primarily due to growth in booking com accommodation room night reservation priceline com retail airline ticket rental car and hotel reservation service and rentalcars com rental car reservation service merchant gross booking increased for the year ended december compared to the year ended december primarily due to increase in agoda com hotel reservation service rentalcars com rental car reservation service and priceline com express deal hotel and retail hotel reservation service partially offset by decline in priceline com name your own price service unit sold for accommodation room night rental car day and airline ticket for the year ended december and were follows year ended december in million changeroom rental car airline accommodation room night reservation increased by for the year ended december compared to the year ended december due to an increase in booking com agoda com and priceline com accommodation room night reservation booking com our most significant brand included over property on it website of february which included over vacation rental property compared to approximately property of february which included over vacation rental property updated property count are available on the booking com website booking com ha added property over the past year in it core european market well higher growth market such north america which is newer market for booking com asia pacific and south america an increasing amount of our business from destination and point of sale perspective is conducted in our newer market which are growing faster than our overall growth rate and our core european market rental car day reservation increased by for the year ended december compared to the year ended december due to an increase in price disclosed rental car day reservation for rentalcars com and priceline com partially offset by decline in priceline com name your own price rental car reservation service airline ticket reservation increased by for the year ended december compared to the year ended december due to an increase in price disclosed airline ticket reservation for priceline com driven primarily by increased paid advertising placement on kayak which began in the third quarter of partially offset by decline in priceline com name your own price airline ticket reservation service revenueswe classify our revenue into three category agency revenue are derived from travel related transaction where we are not the merchant of record and where the price of the travel service are determined by third party agency revenue include travel commission gd reservation booking fee related to certain travel service travel insurance fee and customer processing fee and are reported at the net amount received without any associated cost of revenue substantially all of the revenue for booking com is agency revenue comprised of travel commission merchant revenue are derived from service where we are the merchant of record and therefore charge the customer credit card for the travel service provided merchant revenue include transaction revenue representing the price of name your own price hotel rental car and airline ticket reservation and vacation charged to customer transaction revenue representing the amount charged to customer le the amount charged to by travel service provider in connection with the accommodation reservation provided through our merchant price disclosed hotel reservation service at agoda com and priceline com and the reservation provided through our merchant rental car service at rentalcars com and merchant express deal reservation service at priceline com customer processing fee charged in connection with priceline com name your own price reservation service express deal reservation service and merchant price disclosed hotel reservation service and ancillary fee including gd reservation booking fee related to certain of the service listed above advertising and other revenue are derived primarily from revenue earned by kayak for sending referral to otas and travel service provider advertising placement on kayak website and mobile apps reservation revenue earned by opentable fee for restaurant guest seated through opentable online reservation service subscription fee earned by opentable for restaurant reservation management service and revenue generated by booking com hotel marketing service revenue from kayak is net of intercompany revenue earned by kayak from other priceline group brand year ended december in thousand changeagency revenue merchant advertising and other total revenue agency revenuesagency revenue for the year ended december increased compared to the year ended december primarily result of growth in the business of booking com our priceline com agency revenue benefited from growth in our retail rental car agency airline ticket and agency hotel reservation business merchant revenuesmerchant revenue for the year ended december decreased compared to the year ended december primarily due to decrease in revenue from priceline com name your own price reservation service mostly offset by increase in our agoda com business rentalcars com business priceline com express deal and retail merchant hotel reservation service and priceline com express deal rental car reservation service merchant revenue declined versus the prior year despite growth in merchant gross booking because our merchant revenue are disproportionately affected by priceline com name your own price service name your own price revenue which declined year over year are recorded gross with corresponding travel service provider cost recorded in cost of revenue and represented smaller percentage year over year of total revenue compared to our faster growing agoda com rentalcars com and priceline com retail merchant hotel and express deal reservation service which are recorded in revenue net of travel service provider cost result we believe that gross profit is an important measure to evaluate growth in our business advertising and other revenuesadvertising and other revenue during the year ended december consisted primarily of advertising revenue restaurant reservation revenue and subscription revenue for restaurant reservation management service other revenue for the year ended december includes million of opentable revenue earned since it acquisition on july cost of revenue year ended december in thousand changecost of revenue of revenue for the year ended december cost of revenue consisted primarily of the cost paid to travel service provider for priceline com name your own price reservation service net of applicable tax and charge fee paid to third party by kayak and priceline com to return travel itinerary information in response to search query and cost related to accrual for travel transaction tax hotel occupancy tax excise tax sale tax etc cost of revenue for the year ended december decreased by compared to the year ended december primarily due to decrease in priceline com name your own price reservation service cost of revenue for the year ended december includes an accrual recorded in the first quarter of of approximately million including estimated interest and penalty for travel transaction tax principally related to unfavorable ruling in the state of hawaii and the district of columbia partially offset by reduction in our accrual related to travel transaction tax of million recorded in the fourth quarter of principally related to favorable agreement and ruling in the district of columbia agency revenue have no cost of revenue agency revenue principally consist of travel commission on accommodation reservation gross profit year ended december in thousand changegross profit gross total gross profit for the year ended december increased by compared to the year ended december growth on local currency basis wa approximately primarily result of the increased revenue discussed above total gross margin gross profit expressed percentage of total revenue increased during the year ended december compared to the year ended december because our revenue are disproportionately affected by priceline com name your own price reservation service name your own price revenue are recorded gross with corresponding travel service provider cost recorded in cost of revenue and in the year ended december these revenue represented smaller percentage of total revenue than in the year ended december our retail and semi opaque reservation service which are recorded in revenue net of travel provider cost have been growing faster than priceline com name your own price reservation service result we believe that gross profit is an important measure to evaluate growth in our business our international operation accounted for approximately billion of our gross profit for the year ended december which compare to billion for the year ended december gross profit attributable to our international operation increased on local currency basis by approximately for the year ended december compared to the year ended december gross profit attributable to our business increased by approximately for the year ended december compared to the year ended december gross profit for the year ended december wa positively impacted by the inclusion of opentable and kayak since their acquisition on july and may respectively gross profit for the year ended december wa negatively impacted by an accrual recorded in the first quarter of of approximately million including estimated interest and penalty for travel transaction tax principally related to unfavorable ruling in the state of hawaii and the district of columbia partially offset by credit in the fourth quarter of of million principally related to favorable agreement and ruling in the district of columbia the dollar is significantly stronger against the euro and many other currency of january compared to at these exchange rate the growth of our total and international gross booking expressed in dollar will be significantly adversely impacted in expense advertising year ended december in thousand changeonline advertising of total gross offline advertising of total gross online advertising expense primarily consist of the cost of search engine keyword purchase referral from meta search and travel research website affiliate program and banner pop up and other internet and mobile advertisement for the year ended december online advertising expense increased compared to the year ended december primarily to generate increased gross booking online advertising percentage of gross profit for the year ended december benefited from the inclusion of kayak and opentable because they spend lower percentage of gross profit on online advertising than our other brand also our consolidated result exclude intercompany advertising by our brand on kayak since the acquisition on may in addition the share of our business coming directly to our website with no associated online advertising expense increased during the year ended december these favorable impact were almost entirely offset for the year ended december by year over year decline in advertising roi and brand mix within the priceline group booking com agoda com and rentalcars com grew faster than priceline com and typically spend higher percentage of gross profit on online advertising trend that we expect to continue gross profit for the year ended december wa negatively impacted by an accrual recorded in the first

proceeding to date it is possible that they will do so in the future or that they will seek to amend their tax statute and seek to collect tax from only on prospective basis see note to the consolidated financial statement for description of these pending case and proceeding and part item risk factor adverse application of state and local tax law could have an adverse effect on our

table because we can not reasonably estimate the timing of such payment on december our convertible senior note due became convertible at the option of the holder without regard to our stock price and

amount in cash and we have elected to deliver cash for the conversion value in excess of the aggregate principal amount we would likely fund our conversion obligation from cash and cash equivalent short term investment and borrowing under our revolving credit facility we believe that our existing cash balance and liquid resource will be sufficient to fund our operating activity capital expenditure and other obligation through at least the next twelve month however if during that period or thereafter we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operation or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amount and on term acceptable to we may be required to reduce our planned capital expenditure and scale back the scope of our business plan either of which could have material adverse effect on our future financial condition or result of operation if additional fund were raised through the issuance of equity security the percentage ownership of our then current stockholder would be diluted we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operation in the future revenue growth or sustained profitability may not be realized and

capital resource item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we manage our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk through internally established policy and

litigation jpml consolidated all of the pending case under before judge boyle in the district court for the northern district of texas on may an amended consolidated complaint wa filed on february judge boyle dismissed the amended consolidated complaint without prejudice on october the court denied plaintiff motion for leave to file proposed second consolidated amended complaint and on october the court issued final judgment dismissing the case with prejudice the time to appeal the court october decision ha expired and the matter is closed litigation related to travel transaction tax the company and certain third party online travel company otcs are currently involved in approximately forty lawsuit including certified and putative class action brought by or against state city and county over issue involving the payment of travel transaction tax hotel occupancy tax excise tax sale tax etc the company subsidiary priceline com llc lowestfare com llc and travelweb llc are named in some but not all of these case generally the complaint allege among other thing that the otcs violated each jurisdiction respective relevant travel transaction tax ordinance with respect to the charge and remittance of amount to cover tax under each law the complaint typically seek compensatory damage disgorgement penalty available by law attorney fee and other relief in addition approximately seventy nine municipality or county and at least eleven state have initiated audit proceeding including proceeding initiated by more than forty municipality in california which have been inactive for several year issued proposed tax assessment or started inquiry relating to the payment of travel transaction tax additional state and local jurisdiction are likely to assert that the company is subject to travel transaction tax and could seek to collect such tax retroactively and or prospectively with respect to the principal claim in these matter the company belief that the law at issue do not apply to the service it provides namely the facilitation of travel reservation and therefore that it doe not owe the tax that are claimed to be owed rather the company belief that the law at issue generally impose travel transaction tax on entity that own operate or control hotel or similar business or furnish or provide hotel room or similar accommodation or other travel service in addition in many of these matter the taxing jurisdiction have asserted claim for conversion essentially that the company ha collected tax and wrongfully pocketed those tax dollar claim that the company belief is without basis and ha vigorously contested the taxing jurisdiction that are currently involved in litigation and other proceeding with the company and that may be involved in future proceeding have asserted contrary position and will likely continue to do so from time to time the company ha found it expedient to settle and may in the future agree to settle claim pending in these matter without conceding that the claim at issue are meritorious or that the claimed tax are in fact due to be paid connection with some of these tax audit and assessment the company may be required to pay any assessed tax which amount may be substantial prior to being allowed to contest the assessment and the applicability of the law in judicial proceeding this requirement is commonly referred to pay to play or pay first for example the city and county of san francisco assessed the company approximately million an amount that includes interest and penalty relating to hotel occupancy tax which the company paid in july and issued second assessment totaling approximately million which the company paid in january payment of these amount if any is not an admission that the company belief it is subject to such tax in the san francisco action for example the court ruled in february that the company and otcs do not owe transient accommodation tax to the city and ordered the city to refund the amount paid in july the company also is seeking refund of the amount paid in january san francisco ha appealed the court ruling and ha not refunded the amount paid in july pending resolution of the appeal the matter ha been stayed while the appeal in another case with the city of san diego is pending before the california supreme court litigation is subject to uncertainty and there could be adverse development in these pending or future case and proceeding for example in january the tax appeal court for the state of hawaii held that the company and other otcs are not liable for the state transient accommodation tax but held that the otcs including the company are liable for the state general excise tax on the full amount the otc collect from the customer for hotel room reservation without any offset for amount passed through to the hotel the company recorded an accrual for travel transaction tax including estimated interest and penalty with corresponding charge to cost of revenue of approximately million in december and approximately million in the three month ended march primarily related to this ruling during the year ended december and december the company paid approximately million and million respectively to the state of hawaii related to this ruling the company ha filed an appeal now pending before the hawaii supreme court other adverse ruling include decision in september in which the superior court in the district of columbia granted summary judgment in favor of the district and against the otcs ruling that tax is due on the otcs margin and service fee which the company is appealing result the company increased it accrual for travel transaction tax including estimated interest with corresponding charge to cost of revenue by approximately million in september and by approximately million in the three month ended march also in july the circuit court of cook county illinois ruled that the company and the other otcs are liable for tax and other obligation under the chicago hotel accommodation tax in july the company resolved all claim in this case through settlement and the claim against the company were dismissed on september in addition in october jury in san antonio class action found that the company and the other otcs that are defendant in the lawsuit control hotel for purpose of the local hotel occupancy tax ordinance at issue and are therefore subject to the requirement of those ordinance the company intends to vigorously appeal the trial court judgment when it becomes final an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending litigation may encourage the commencement of additional litigation audit proceeding or other regulatory inquiry and also could result in substantial liability for past and or future booking including among other thing interest penalty punitive damage and or attorney fee and cost there have been and will continue to be substantial ongoing cost which may include pay first payment associated with defending the company position in pending and any future case or proceeding an adverse outcome in one or more of these unresolved proceeding could have material adverse effect on the company business and could be material to the company result of operation or cash flow in any given operating period however the company belief that even if it were to suffer adverse determination in the near term in more of the pending proceeding than currently anticipated given result to date it would not have material impact on the company liquidity because of the company available cash to the extent that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that the company service are subject to travel transaction tax and that the company ha tax collection responsibility for those tax or the company determines that it ha such responsibility with respect to future transaction the company may collect any such additional tax obligation from it customer which would have the effect of increasing the cost of travel reservation to it customer and consequently could make the company travel reservation service le competitive compared to the service of other otcs or travel service provider and reduce the company travel reservation transaction alternatively the company could choose to reduce the compensation for it service either action could have material adverse effect on the company business and result of operation in many of the judicial and other proceeding initiated to date the taxing jurisdiction seek not only historical tax that are claimed to be owed on the company gross profit but also among other thing interest penalty punitive damage and or attorney fee and cost therefore any liability associated with travel transaction tax matter is not constrained to the company liability for tax owed on it historical gross profit but may also include among other thing penalty interest and attorney fee to date the majority of the taxing jurisdiction in which the company facilitates hotel reservation have not that these tax are due and payable with respect to taxing jurisdiction that have not initiated proceeding to date it is possible that they will do so in the future or that they will seek to amend their tax statute and seek to collect tax from the company only on prospective basis accrual for travel transaction tax result of this litigation and other attempt by jurisdiction to levy similar tax the company ha established an accrual including estimated interest and penalty for the potential resolution of issue related to travel transaction tax in the amount of approximately million at december compared to approximately million at december the company legal expense for these matter are expensed incurred and are not reflected in the amount accrued the actual cost may be le or greater potentially significantly than the liability recorded an estimate for reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount accrued can not be reasonably made the
