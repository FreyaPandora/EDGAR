cancellation fee related to inventory order that have been canceled or are expected to be canceled the company estimate of future product development plan and demand for it product are the key input in the determination of the recoverability of manufacturing related asset and the assessment of the adequacy of any purchase commitment cancellation fee accrual if there is an abrupt and substantial

product failure outside the company typical experience the company regularly review these estimate and adjusts the amount necessary if actual product failure rate or repair cost differ from estimate revision to the estimated warranty liability would be required income taxesthe company recognizes tax benefit from uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merit of the position the tax benefit recognized in the financial statement from such position are then measured based on the

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskinterest rate and foreign currency risk managementthe company regularly review it foreign exchange forward and option position and interest rate swap both on stand alone basis and in conjunction with it underlying foreign currency and interest rate exposure given the effective horizon of the company risk management activity and the anticipatory nature of the exposure there can be no assurance these position will offset more than portion of the financial impact resulting from movement in either foreign exchange or interest rate further the recognition of the gain and loss related to these instrument may not coincide with the timing of gain and loss related to the underlying economic exposure and therefore may adversely affect the company financial condition and operating result interest rate riskthe company exposure to change in interest rate relates primarily to the company investment portfolio and outstanding debt while the company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuation the company interest income and expense are most sensitive to fluctuation in interest rate change in interest rate affect the interest earned on the company cash cash equivalent and marketable security and the fair value of those security well cost associated with hedging and interest paid on the company debt apple inc form company investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the company liquidity requirement the company us combination of internal and external management to execute it

investment policy generally requires security to be investment grade and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer to provide meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company investment portfolio the company performed sensitivity analysis to determine the impact change in interest rate would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment position of september and september hypothetical basis point increase in interest rate across all maturity would result in billion and billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio respectively such loss would only be realized if the company sold the investment prior to maturity of september and september the company had outstanding floating and fixed rate note with varying maturity for an aggregate carrying amount of billion and billion respectively the company ha entered and in the future may enter into interest rate swap to manage interest rate risk on it outstanding term debt interest rate swap allow the company to effectively convert fixed rate payment into floating rate payment or floating rate payment into fixed rate payment gain and loss on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding loss and gain on the related hedging instrument basis point increase in market interest rate would cause interest expense on the company debt of september and september to increase by million and million on an annualized basis respectively foreign currency riskin general the company is net receiver of currency other than the dollar accordingly change in exchange rate and in particular strengthening of the dollar will negatively affect the company net sale and gross margin expressed in dollar there is risk that the company will have to adjust local currency pricing due to competitive pressure when there ha been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rate the company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contract with financial institution to protect against foreign exchange risk associated with certain existing asset and liability certain firmly committed transaction forecasted future cash flow and net investment in foreign subsidiary in addition the company ha entered and in the future may enter into foreign currency contract to partially offset the foreign currency exchange gain and loss on it foreign currency denominated debt issuance the company generally hedge portion of it forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchase typically for up to month however the company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposure for variety of reason including but not limited to accounting consideration or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposure to provide an assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company foreign currency derivative position the company performed sensitivity analysis using value at risk var model to ass the potential impact of fluctuation in exchange rate the var model consisted of using monte carlo simulation to generate thousand of random market price path assuming normal market condition the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value for given confidence interval to the company foreign currency derivative position due to adverse movement in rate the var model is not intended to represent actual loss but is used risk estimation and management tool forecasted transaction firm commitment and asset and liability denominated in foreign currency were excluded from the model based on the result of the model the company estimate with confidence maximum one day loss in fair value of million of september compared to maximum one day loss in fair value of million of september because the company us foreign currency instrument for hedging purpose the loss in fair value incurred on those instrument are generally offset by increase in the fair value of the underlying exposure actual future gain and loss associated with the company investment portfolio debt and derivative position may differ materially from the sensitivity analysis performed of september due to the inherent limitation associated with predicting the timing and amount of change in interest rate foreign currency exchange
