especially if there is lack of liquidity result of our td ameritrade acquisition our margin option and future business ha materially increased and market liquidity may represent an increased risk we have exposure to credit risk associated with our investment those investment are subject to price fluctuation loss of value of security can negatively affect earnings if management determines that such loss of value ha resulted from credit loss the evaluation of whether credit loss exists is matter of judgment which includes the assessment of multiple factor if management determines that security decline in fair value is the result of credit loss an allowance for credit loss on the security will be recorded and corresponding loss will be recognized in current earnings even if decline in fair value of security is not determined to have resulted from credit loss if we were ever forced to sell the security sooner than intended prior to maturity due to liquidity need we would have to

option or future pledged asset and security lending activity collateralized by or linked to security of single issuer index or industry we sponsor number of proprietary money market mutual fund and other proprietary fund although we have no obligation to do so we may decide for competitive or other reason to provide credit liquidity or other support to our fund in the event of significant decline in valuation of fund holding or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity such support could cause to take significant charge could reduce our liquidity and in certain situation could with respect to proprietary fund other than money market mutual fund result in having to consolidate one or more fund in our financial statement if we choose not to provide credit liquidity or other support in such situation we could suffer reputational damage and it business could be adversely affected the charles schwab corporationrisks related to our td ameritrade acquisitionwe may fail to realize the anticipated cost saving and other benefit of the td ameritrade acquisition which could adversely affect the value of our stock the success of our td ameritrade acquisition will continue to depend in significant part on our ability to realize the anticipated cost saving and other benefit from integrating the business of schwab and td ameritrade which is subject to certain risk if we are not able to successfully combine the business of schwab and td ameritrade within the anticipated time frame or at all the anticipated cost saving and other benefit of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected the combined business may not perform expected and the value of our common stock may be adversely affected it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key schwab or td ameritrade employee the loss of client the disruption of either company or both company ongoing business or in unexpected integration issue higher than expected integration cost and an overall post completion integration process that take longer than originally anticipated most of the integration planning and execution work is currently being done remotely due to the covid pandemic the inability to work in person and on site with information technology and management oversight ha and will continue to make some of the integration work more challenging particularly with regard to technology we will need to continue to hire significant number of technology personnel and contract staff and rely on number of critical technology vendor in order to complete the integration work relating to technology platform and system within the target timeframe in addition we may experience delay in acquiring the technology and infrastructure component needed for the integration due to pandemic related supply chain disruption we have to make certain assumption for integration planning and subsequent change to integration plan impact the timing and cost of the integration for example result of the higher level of trading volume that we recently experienced we had to increase capacity from the original technology build out plan in addition at time the attention of certain member of our management and other resource may be diverted from integration work to critical day to day business operation we may also encounter challenge integrating td ameritrade technology into schwab platform any of these factor could make timely achievement of integration milestone more challenging particularly with regard to technology and system we will continue to incur significant integration cost in connection with the integration of td ameritrade we will continue to incur significant non recurring cost related to formulating and implementing integration plan with respect to combining the operation of schwab and td ameritrade including technology related workforce and facility consolidation cost we continue to ass the magnitude of these cost and additional unanticipated cost may be incurred in the integration of the two company business we may have difficulty attracting motivating and retaining executive and other employee during the integration of td ameritrade uncertainty about the effect of the td ameritrade integration on schwab and td ameritrade employee may impair our ability to attract retain and motivate personnel employee retention may be particularly challenging during the integration process employee of schwab and td ameritrade may experience uncertainty about their future role with the combined business if employee of schwab or td ameritrade depart the integration of the company may be more difficult and the combined business may be harmed furthermore we may have to incur significant cost in identifying hiring and retaining replacement for departing employee and may lose significant expertise and talent relating to the business of schwab or td ameritrade and our ability to realize the anticipated benefit of the acquisition may be adversely affected in addition there could be disruption to or distraction for the workforce and management associated with integrating employee into schwab the charles schwab corporationthe td ameritrade acquisition may not be accretive to our earnings per share which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock based on the anticipated synergy between schwab and td ameritrade we expect the acquisition to be accretive to our earnings per share in the third year following completion of the merger however future event and condition could reduce or delay the accretion that is currently projected or result in the acquisition being dilutive to our earnings per share including adverse change in market condition additional transaction and integration related cost and other factor such the failure to realize some or all of the benefit anticipated in the acquisition any dilution of reduction in or delay of any accretion to our earnings per share could cause the price of share of our common stock to decline or grow at reduced rate other business riskspotential strategic transaction could have negative impact on our financial position we evaluate potential strategic transaction including business combination acquisition and disposition any such transaction could have material impact on our financial position result of operation or cash flow the process of evaluating negotiating effecting and integrating any such strategic transaction may divert management attention from other business concern and might cause the loss of key client employee and business partner moreover integrating business and system may result in unforeseen expenditure well numerous risk and uncertainty including the need to integrate operational financial and management information system and management control integrate relationship with client and business partner and manage facility and employee in different geographic area the integration process could result in the disruption of ongoing business or change to inconsistent standard control procedure and policy that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationship with client employee outsourced service provider and vendor in addition an acquisition may cause to assume liability or become subject to litigation or regulatory proceeding or require the amortization of large amount of acquired intangible asset further we may not realize the anticipated benefit from an acquisition in timely manner or at all including without limitation the recent acquisition of td ameritrade and any future acquisition could be dilutive to our current stockholder percentage ownership or to earnings per common share eps our acquisition and disposition are typically subject to closing condition including regulatory approval and the absence of material adverse change in the business operation or financial condition of the entity or part of an entity being acquired or sold to the extent we enter into an agreement to buy or sell an entity or part of an entity there can be no guarantee that the transaction will close when expected or at all if material transaction doe not close our stock price could decline our industry is highly competitive and characterized by aggressive price competition we operate in highly competitive environment with broad array of competitor from large integrated bank to venture capital backed private company we continually monitor our pricing in relation to competitor and periodically adjust interest rate on deposit and loan fee for advisory service expense ratio on mutual fund and etf trade commission rate and other pricing and incentive to sustain our competitive position increased price competition from other financial service firm to attract client such reduced commission higher deposit rate reduced mutual fund or etf expense ratio or the increased use of incentive could impact our result of operation and financial condition we face competition in hiring and retaining qualified employee the market for qualified personnel in our business is highly competitive at various time different function and role are in especially high demand in the market compelling to pay more to attract talent recently the challenge and cost for to retain and hire talent ha increased in september we implemented salary increase for almost all of our employee our ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to attract new employee and retain existing employee while managing compensation cost we need to continue to hire significant number of technology personnel and contract staff to complete the td ameritrade integration work within the target timeframe demand for skilled technology professional is high and we may experience delay in hiring the appropriate skilled resource the charles schwab corporationour stock price ha fluctuated historically and may continue to fluctuate our stock price can be volatile among the factor that may affect the volatility of our stock price are the following speculation in the investment community or the press about or actual change in our competitive position organizational structure executive team operation financial condition financial reporting and result expense discipline strategic transaction progress on achieving the expected benefit from our td ameritrade acquisition or rating from third party the announcement of new product service acquisition or disposition by or our

sensitive asset and liability key assumption include the projection of interest rate scenario with rate floor prepayment speed of mortgage related investment repricing of financial instrument and reinvestment of matured or paid down security and loan net interest revenue is affected by various factor such the distribution and composition of interest earning asset and interest bearing liability the spread between yield earned on interest earning asset and rate paid on interest bearing liability which may reprice at different time or by different amount and the spread between short and long term interest rate interest earning asset include investment security margin loan and bank loan these asset are sensitive to change in interest rate and change in prepayment level that tend to increase in declining rate environment and decrease in rising rate environment because we establish the rate paid on certain brokerage client cash balance and bank deposit and the rate charged on certain margin and bank loan and control the composition of our investment security we have some ability to manage our net interest spread depending on competitive factor and market condition net interest revenue sensitivity analysis assumes the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed result of the simulated change in interest rate we actively manage the consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure in all likelihood we would take step to manage additional interest rate exposure that could result from change in the interest rate environment the following table show the simulated change to net interest revenue over the next month beginning december and of gradual basis point increase or decrease in market interest rate relative to prevailing market rate at the end of each reporting period december of basis decrease of basis point the company simulated increase of basis point in market interest rate had slightly lower impact on net interest revenue at year end compared with year end due to an increase in the company projected repricing of client deposit rate across higher market interest rate scenario which wa partially offset result of holding higher allocation of floating rate asset on the balance sheet at december relative to the prior year end simulated decrease of basis point in market interest rate had slightly larger impact year over year primarily result of holding higher allocation of floating rate asset higher short term interest rate would positively impact net interest revenue yield on interest earning asset are expected to rise faster than the cost of funding source decline in interest rate could negatively impact the yield on the company investment and loan portfolio to greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense from funding source compressing net interest margin the charles schwab corporationmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition and

in the context of the design purpose and risk of the vie well any involvement of related party provides with the power to direct the most significant activity of the vie and ii the obligation to

benefit of client cash and investment segregated and on deposit for regulatory purpose include resale agreement which are collateralized by government and agency security resale agreement are accounted for collateralized financing transaction that are recorded at their contractual amount plus accrued interest under these resale agreement the company obtains collateral with market value equal to or in excess of the principal amount loaned and the interest accrued collateral is valued daily by the company with additional collateral obtained to ensure full collateralization cash and investment segregated also include certificate of deposit and government security certificate of deposit and government security are recorded at fair value and unrealized gain and loss are included in earnings schwab applies the practical expedient based on collateral maintenance provision under asc financial instrument credit loss asc in estimating an allowance for credit loss for resale agreement this practical expedient can be applied for financial asset with collateral maintenance provision requiring the borrower to continually adjust the amount of the collateral securing the financial asset result of fair value change in the collateral in accordance with the practical expedient when the company reasonably expects that borrower or counterparties applicable will replenish the collateral required there is no expectation of credit loss when the collateral fair value is greater than the amortized cost of the financial asset if the amortized cost exceeds the fair value of collateral then credit loss are estimated only on the unsecured portion receivables from brokerage client receivables from brokerage client include margin loan to security brokerage client and other trading receivables from client margin loan are collateralized by client security and are carried at the amount receivable net of an allowance for credit loss collateral is required to be maintained at specified minimum level at all time the company monitor margin level and requires client to provide additional collateral or reduce margin position to meet minimum collateral requirement if the fair value of the collateral change schwab applies the practical expedient based on collateral maintenance provision in estimating an allowance for credit loss for margin loan an allowance for credit loss on unsecured or partially secured receivables from brokerage client is estimated based on the aging of those receivables unsecured balance due to confirmed fraud are reserved immediately the company policy is to charge off any delinquent margin loan including the accrued interest on such loan no later than at day past due accrued interest charged off is recognized credit loss expense and is included in other expense in the consolidated statement of income client with margin loan have agreed to allow schwab to pledge collateralized security in accordance with federal regulation the

repurchase liability afs investment securitiesafs investment security are recorded at fair value and unrealized gain and loss other than loss related to credit factor are reported net of tax in aoci included in stockholder equity realized gain and loss from sale of afs investment security are determined using the specific identification method and are included in other revenue interest income is recognized using the effective interest method based on the contractual term of the security where applicable prepayment are accounted for they occur prepayment are not estimated an afs investment security is impaired if the fair value of the security is le than it amortized cost basis management evaluates afs investment security with unrealized loss to determine whether the security impairment ha resulted from credit loss or other factor this evaluation is performed quarterly on an individual security basis the evaluation of whether credit loss exists is inherently judgmental this evaluation considers multiple factor including the financial condition of the issuer the payment structure of the security external credit rating our internal credit rating the security market implied credit spread for asset backed security the amount of credit support provided by the structure of the security to absorb credit loss on the underlying collateral recent event specific to the issuer and the issuer industry and whether all scheduled principal and interest payment have been received if management determines that the impairment of an afs investment security or portion of the impairment is related to credit loss an allowance for credit loss is recorded for that security through charge to earnings the allowance for credit loss is measured the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of expected cash flow and is limited to the difference between amortized cost and the fair value of the security the company estimate credit loss on discounted cash flow basis using the security effective interest rate change in the allowance for credit loss are recorded through earnings in the period of the change if it is determined that the company intends to sell the impaired security or if it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the security before any anticipated recovery of the amortized cost basis any allowance for credit loss of that security will be written off and the amortized cost basis of the security will be written down to fair value with any incremental impairment recorded through earnings the company excludes accrued interest from the fair value and the amortized cost basis of the afs investment security for the purpose of identifying and measuring impairment of the security afs investment security are placed on nonaccrual status on timely basis and any accrued interest receivable is reversed through interest income security borrowed and security loaned security borrowed transaction require schwab to deliver cash to the lender in exchange for security the receivables from these transaction are included in other asset on the consolidated balance sheet for security loaned schwab receives collateral in the form of cash in an amount equal to or greater than the market value of security loaned the payable from these transaction are included in accrued expense and other liability on the consolidated balance sheet the market value of security borrowed and loaned is monitored and collateral is adjusted to ensure full collateralization fee received or paid are recorded in interest revenue or interest expense schwab applies the practical expedient based on collateral maintenance provision in estimating an allowance for credit loss for security borrowed receivables bank loan and related allowance for loan lossesbank loan held for investment are recorded at amortized cost which is comprised of the contractual principal amount adjusted for unamortized direct origination cost or net purchase discount or premium direct origination cost and premium and discount are recognized in interest revenue using the effective interest method over the contractual life of the loan and are adjusted for actual prepayment additionally management estimate an allowance for credit loss which is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loan to arrive at the amount expected to be collected the bank loan portfolio includes three portfolio segment residential real estate pal and other loan we use these segment when developing and documenting our methodology for determining the allowance for credit loss the residential real estate portfolio segment is the charles schwab corporationnotes to consolidated financial statement tabular amount in million except per share data option price amount ratio or noted divided into two class of financing receivables for purpose of monitoring and assessing credit risk first mortgage and helocs schwab record an allowance for credit loss through charge to earnings based on our estimate of current expected credit loss for the existing portfolio we review the allowance for credit loss quarterly taking into consideration current economic condition reasonable and supportable forecast the composition of the existing loan portfolio past loss experience and any other risk inherent in the portfolio to ensure that the allowance for credit loss is maintained at an appropriate level pal are collateralized by marketable security with liquid market credit line are over collateralized and borrower are required to maintain collateral at specified level at all time the required collateral level are determined based on the type of security pledged additionally collateral market value is monitored on daily basis and borrower credit line may be reduced or collateral may be liquidated if the collateral is in danger of falling below specified level such the credit loss inherent within this portfolio is limited schwab applies the practical expedient based on collateral maintenance provision in estimating an allowance for credit loss for pal the methodology to establish an allowance for credit loss for the residential real estate portfolio segment utilizes statistical model that estimate prepayment default and expected loss for this portfolio segment based on predicted behavior of individual loan within the segment the methodology also evaluates concentration in the class of financing receivables including loan product within those class year of origination and geographical distribution of collateral expected credit loss are forecast using loan level simulation of the delinquency status of the loan over the term of the loan the simulation start with the current relevant risk indicator including the current delinquent status of each loan the estimated current ltv ratio of each loan the term and structure of each loan borrower fico score and current key interest rate including treasury sofr and libor rate the more significant variable in the simulation include delinquency roll rate loss severity housing price interest rate and the unemployment rate delinquency roll rate the rate at which loan transition through delinquency stage and ultimately result in loss are estimated from our historical loss experience adjusted for current trend and market information which includes current and forecasted condition loss severity loss given default estimate are based on our historical loss experience and market trend both current and forecasted the loss severity estimate used in the allowance for credit loss methodology for helocs is higher than that used in the methodology for first mortgage housing price trend are derived from historical home price index and econometric forecast of future home value factor affecting the home price index include housing inventory unemployment interest rate and inflation expectation interest rate projection are based on the current term structure of interest rate and historical volatility to project various possible future interest rate path the unemployment rate forecast is typically based on the recent consensus of regularly published economic survey linear interpolation is applied to revert to long term trend after the reasonable and supportable forecast period the methodology described above result in loss factor that are applied to the amortized cost basis of loan exclusive of accrued interest receivable to determine the allowance for credit loss for first mortgage and helocs management also estimate liability for expected credit loss on the company commitment to extend credit related to unused helocs and commitment to purchase first mortgage see note for additional information on these commitment the liability is calculated by applying the loss factor described above to the commitment expected to be funded and is included in accrued expense and other liability on the consolidated balance sheet the liability for expected credit loss on these commitment and related activity were immaterial for all period presented schwab considers loan modification in which it make an economic concession to borrower experiencing financial difficulty to be troubled debt restructurings tdrs nonaccrual nonperforming and impaired loansfirst mortgage helocs pal and other loan are placed on nonaccrual status upon becoming day past due to interest or principal unless the loan are well secured and in the process of collection or when the full timely collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain including loan to borrower who have filed for bankruptcy heloc loan secured by second lien are placed on non accrual status if the associated first lien is day or more delinquent regardless of the payment status of the heloc when loan is placed on nonaccrual status the accrued and unpaid interest receivable is reversed and the loan is accounted for on the cash or cost recovery method until qualifying for return to accrual status the charles schwab corporationnotes to consolidated financial statement tabular amount in million except per share data option price amount ratio or noted generally nonaccrual loan may be returned to accrual status when all delinquent interest and principal is repaid and the borrower demonstrates sustained period of performance or when the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection and collectability is no longer doubtful loan on nonaccrual status and other real estate owned are considered nonperforming asset loan charge offsthe company charge off loan in the period that it is deemed uncollectible and record reduction in the allowance for credit loss and the loan balance our charge off policy for first mortgage and heloc loan is to ass the value of the property when the loan ha been delinquent for day or ha been discharged in bankruptcy proceeding regardless of whether the property is in foreclosure and charge off the amount of the loan balance in excess of the estimated current value of the underlying property le estimated cost to sell the company policy for pal is to charge off any delinquent loan no later than at day past

consideration of functional and economic obsolescence the company determined the weighted average useful life of the asset based on the current condition and expected future use of the asset of the date of acquisition goodwill goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually or whenever indication of impairment exist impairment exists when the carrying amount of reporting unit exceeds it estimated fair value resulting in an impairment charge for this excess with the maximum charge limited to the carrying value of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit our annual impairment testing date is april schwab can elect to qualitatively ass goodwill for impairment if it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit exceeds it carrying value qualitative assessment considers macroeconomic and other industry specific factor such trend in short term and long term interest rate and the ability to access capital and company specific factor such market capitalization in excess of net asset trend in revenue generating activity and merger or acquisition activity if the company elect to bypass qualitatively assessing goodwill or it is not more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit exceeds it carrying value management estimate the fair value of each of the company reporting unit defined the company business for which financial

liability in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date fair value measurement accounting guidance describes the fair value hierarchy for disclosing asset and liability measured at fair value based on the input used to value them the fair value hierarchy maximizes the use of observable input and minimizes the use of unobservable input observable input are based on market pricing data obtained from third party source independent of the company quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and is generally used to measure fair value whenever available unobservable input reflect management judgment about the assumption market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability where input used to measure fair value of an asset or liability are from different level of the hierarchy the asset or liability is categorized based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in it entirety assessing the significance of particular input requires judgment the fair value hierarchy includes three level based on the objectivity of the input follows level input are quoted price in active market of the measurement date for identical asset or liability that the company ha the ability to access level input are input other than quoted price included in level that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly level input include quoted price for similar asset and liability in active market the charles schwab corporationnotes to consolidated financial

for the asset or liability asset and liability measured at fair value on recurring basisschwab asset and liability measured at fair value on recurring basis include certain cash equivalent certain investment segregated and on deposit for regulatory purpose afs security and certain other asset and accrued expense and other liability the company us the market approach to determine the fair value of asset and liability when available the company us quoted price in active market to measure the fair value of asset and liability quoted price for investment in exchange traded security represent end of day close price published by exchange quoted price for money market fund and other mutual fund represent reported net asset value when utilizing market data and bid ask spread the company us the price within the bid ask spread that best represents fair value when quoted price in active market do not exist the company us price obtained from independent third party pricing service to measure the fair value of investment asset and we generally obtain price from three independent third party pricing source for such asset recorded at fair value our primary independent pricing service provides price for our fixed income investment such commercial paper certificate of deposit government and agency security state and municipal security corporate debt security asset backed security foreign government agency security and non agency commercial mortgage backed security such price are based on observable trade broker dealer quote and discounted cash flow that incorporate observable information such yield for similar type of security benchmark interest rate plus observable spread and weighted average maturity for the same or similar to be issued security we compare the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service to the price obtained from the additional independent pricing service to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable schwab doe not adjust the price received from independent third party pricing service unless such price are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in material difference in the amount recorded liability measured at fair value on recurring basis include repurchase liability related to client held fractional share of equity etf and other security see other
