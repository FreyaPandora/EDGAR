china initially open with lower margin that grow significantly over time supplemental information regarding company operated restaurantswe continually review our restaurant ownership mix with goal of improving local relevance profit and return in most case franchising is the best way to achieve these goal but previously stated company operated restaurant are also important to our success we report result for company operated restaurant based on their sale le cost directly incurred by that business including occupancy cost we report the result for franchised restaurant based on franchised revenue le associated occupancy cost for this reason and because we manage our business based on geographic segment and not on the basis of our ownership structure we do not specifically allocate selling general and administrative expense and other operating income expense to company operated or franchised restaurant other operating item that relate to the company operated restaurant generally include gain loss on sale of restaurant business and write offs of equipment and leasehold improvement we believe the following information about company operated restaurant in our most significant segment provides an additional perspective on this business management of the company considers this information when evaluating restaurant ownership mix subject to other relevant consideration the following table seek to illustrate the two component of our company operated margin the first of these relates exclusively to restaurant operation which we refer to store operating margin the second relates to the value of our brand and the real estate interest we retain for which we charge rent and royalty we refer to this component brand real estate margin both company operated and conventional franchised restaurant are charged rent and royalty although rent and royalty for company operated restaurant are eliminated in consolidation rent and royalty for both restaurant ownership type are based on percentage of sale and the actual rent percentage varies depending on the level of mcdonald investment in the restaurant royalty rate may also vary by market shown in the following table in disaggregating the component of our company operated margin certain cost with respect to company operated restaurant are reflected in brand real estate margin those cost consist of rent payable by mcdonald to third party on leased site and depreciation for building and leasehold improvement and constitute portion of occupancy other operating expense recorded in the consolidated statement of income store operating margin reflect rent and royalty expense and those amount are accounted for income in calculating brand real estate margin while we believe that the following information provides perspective in evaluating our company operated business it is not intended measure of our operating performance or an alternative to operating income or restaurant margin reported by the company in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the in particular noted previously we do not allocate selling general and administrative expense to our company operated business however we believe that about per restaurant on average is the typical cost to support this business in the the actual cost in market outside theu will vary depending on local circumstance and the organizational structure of the market these cost reflect the indirect service we believe are necessary to provide the appropriate support of the restaurant mcdonald corporation annual report europe

reconciliation of return on incremental invested capitalroiic is measure reviewed by management over one year and three year time period to evaluate the overall profitability of the business unit the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital this measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rate to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation the numerator is the company incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period the denominator is the weighted average cash used for investing activity during the applicable one or three year period the weighted average cash used for investing activity is based on weighting applied on quarterly basis these weighting are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter investing activity to incremental operating income for example fourth quarter investing activity are weighted le because the asset purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income of fourth quarter investing activity are included in the one year and three year calculation in contrast fourth quarter is heavily weighted because the asset purchased were deployed more than month ago and therefore have full year impact on operating income with little or no impact to the base period and of fourth quarter investing activity are included in the one year and three year calculation respectively management belief that weighting cash used for investing activity provides more accurate reflection of the
