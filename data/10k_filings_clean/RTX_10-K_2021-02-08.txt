impact related to the covid pandemic if it impact on commercial aerospace continues we are monitoring supplier liquidity and working continuously with our supply base to ensure an adequate source of supply and to reduce cost we pursue cost reduction through number of mechanism including consolidating our purchase reducing the number of supplier strategic global sourcing and competition among potential supplier in some instance we depend upon single source of supply or participate in commodity market that may be subject to allocation of limited supply by supplier like other user in the we are largely dependent upon foreign source for certain raw material such cobalt tantalum chromium rhenium and nickel we have number of ongoing program to manage this dependence and the accompanying

level of economic activity such decrease in business and consumer spending air travel the financial strength of airline and business jet operator and government procurement coronavirus disease covid ha affected and will continue to affect our business supply chain operation and the industry in which we operate the covid pandemic ha significantly increased global economic and demand uncertainty public and private sector policy and initiative in the and worldwide to address the transmission of covid such the imposition of travel restriction and the adoption of remote working have impacted the company business operation and the industry in which we operate the disruption to air travel and commercial activity generally and significant restriction and limitation on business attributable to the covid pandemic ha negatively impacted the global supply demand and distribution capability of the aerospace and commercial airline industry in particular the decrease in air travel resulting from the covid pandemic ha resulted in the loss of business and leisure passenger traffic and is adversely affecting our airline and airframer customer and their demand for our product and service aircraft manufacturer are reducing production rate due to fewer expected aircraft delivery and cancelling new airframer program and result demand for our original equipment manufacturer oem product ha decreased in addition significant decline in aircraft flight hour are resulting in reduced demand for our aftermarket part and service moreover airline and airline leasing company have been deferring and are expected to continue to defer maintenance service which negatively impact our related revenue some airline have accelerated retirement of certain aircraft thereby eliminating our continuing service and negatively impacting our aftermarket revenue with respect to those aircraft further significant portion of our long term support contract are driven by actual usage and decreased usage ha and will continue to negatively affect our revenue associated with these type of contract covid may also limit the ability of our customer generally to perform including in making timely payment to in addition we provide aircraft financing commitment in the form of debt or lease financing to commercial aerospace customer covid may increase the need for these customer to utilize these financing commitment due to the pandemic adverse impact on their business or the inability of these customer to obtain more favorable term from other financing source if financing commitment are exercised the company will need to divert cash to satisfy them and these customer may be unable to make payment the covid pandemic ha impacted and will continue to impact the company supply chain including the ability of supplier and vendor to provide their product and service to the company at this time some of our supplier have reduced or ceased operation result of covid this supply chain impact could also contribute to performance delay on our customer obligation and increase our cost we are continuing to face operational challenge from the need to protect employee health and safety workplace disruption and restriction on the movement of people and good at our own facility and at customer and supplier in addition continued reduced operation and business disruption including if significant portion of our workforce or our supplier workforce are unable to work effectively due to facility closure illness quarantine government action or other restriction could hinder or delay our production capability generally and otherwise impede our ability to perform on our obligation to our customer and may also result in increased cost to the continued spread of covid may also affect our ability to of contentshire develop and retain our talented and diverse workforce and to maintain our corporate culture any cost associated with covid may not be fully recoverable or adequately covered by insurance the covid pandemic also may materially impact government sale including change or shift in defense spending due to budgetary constraint the allocation of fund to governmental response to covid failure to complete the government budget process resulting in continuing resolution cr or government shutdown or otherwise and uncertain funding of program covid ha impacted and may further impact the broader economy of affected country including negatively impacting economic growth and creating volatility and unpredictability in financial and capital market foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate these impact and the resulting volatility and disruption to the global capital market may increase the cost of capital and may adversely impact access to capital for the company and our supplier and customer including heightened counter party risk associated with foreign exchange hedging transaction interest rate swap solvency of revolving credit facility bank and the ability to raise capital both short term and long term any of these factor depending on the severity and duration of the covid pandemic and it effect could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition and cash flow the ultimate financial impact of the covid pandemic is unknown at this time the extent of such impact depends on future development which are highly uncertain and can not be predicted in the short or long term including new information which may emerge concerning the scope severity and duration of the covid pandemic well any worsening of the pandemic the effect of mutating strain and whether additional outbreak of the pandemic will continue to occur action to contain the pandemic spread or treat it impact timing of the availability of vaccine and their distribution acceptance and efficacy and governmental business and individual personal action taken in response to the pandemic including restriction and limitation on travel and transportation and change in leisure and business travel pattern and work environment among others some of these action and related impact may be trend that continue in the future even after the pandemic no longer pose significant public health risk change in government defense spending could negatively impact our financial position result of operation liquidity and overall business government sale constitute significant portion of our consolidated sale our government revenue largely result from contract awarded under various government program primarily defense related program with the department of defense dod and broad range of program with the intelligence community and other department and agency change in government defense spending for various reason including result of potential change in policy position or priority which may result from the recent presidential and congressional election could negatively impact our result of operation financial condition and liquidity our program are subject to government policy budget decision and appropriation process which are driven by numerous factor including geopolitical event macroeconomic condition and the ability of the government to enact relevant legislation such appropriation bill in recent year government appropriation have been affected by larger government budgetary issue and related legislation in previous year the government ha been unable to complete it budget process before the end of it fiscal year resulting in both governmental shut down and cr providing only enough fund for government agency to continue operating at prior year level further if the government debt ceiling is not raised and the national debt reach the statutory debt ceiling the government could default on it debt result government defense spending level are subject to wide range of outcome and are difficult to predict beyond the near term due to numerous factor including the external threat environment future governmental priority and the state of governmental finance significant change in government defense spending or change in government priority policy and requirement could have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and liquidity we face risk relating to our government contract and the mix of our government contract and program that could negatively impact our financial condition result of operation liquidity and overall business the termination of one or more of our contract or the occurrence of performance delay cost overrun product failure material or component shortage or contract definitization delay could negatively impact our result of operation financial condition and liquidity government contract generally permit the government to terminate the contract in whole or in part without prior notice at the government convenience or for default based on performance if one of our contract is terminated for convenience we would generally be entitled to payment for our allowable cost and would receive some allowance for profit on the work performed if one of our contract is terminated for default we would generally be entitled to payment for work accepted by the government termination arising of our default could expose to liability and have negative impact on our ability to obtain future contract and order in addition we are subcontractor and not the prime contractor on some contract in these arrangement the government could terminate the prime contract for convenience or otherwise of contentswithout regard to our performance subcontractor further we can give no assurance that we would be awarded new government contract to offset the revenue lost result of the termination of any of our contract in addition the funding of government program is subject to congressional appropriation made on fiscal year basis even for multi year program program are often only partially funded initially and may not continue to be funded in future year appropriation bill may be delayed which may result in delay to funding the collection of receivables and our contract performance due to lack of authorized fund to procure related product and service under certain circumstance we may use our own fund to meet our customer desired delivery date or other requirement but we may not be reimbursed further if appropriation for one of our program become unavailable reduced or delayed the government may terminate for convenience our contract or subcontract under that program our government contract typically involve the development application and manufacture of advanced defense and technology system and product aimed at achieving challenging goal new technology may be untested or unproven and in some instance product requirement or specification may be modified result we may experience technological and other performance difficulty which may result in delay setback cost overrun or product failure and could divert our attention or resource from other project our failure to execute effectively on our development program could impact our future sale opportunity additionally in order to win certain government contract we may be required to invest in development prior to award our customer demand more mature and proven solution these additional investment amount may not be worthwhile if we are not chosen for new contract award our government contract are typically either fixed priced contract or cost reimbursement contract fixed price contract are predominantly either firm fixed price ffp contract or fixed price incentive fpi contract under ffp contract we receive fixed price irrespective of the actual cost we incur and we therefore carry the burden of any cost overrun under fpi contract we generally share with the government saving for cost underruns le than target cost and expense for cost overrun exceeding target cost to negotiated ceiling price we carry the entire burden of cost overrun exceeding the ceiling price amount under fpi contract under cost reimbursable contract we are reimbursed for allowable cost and paid fixed or performance based fee but we are generally not reimbursed for unauthorized cost exceeding cost ceiling amount or cost not allowable under the contract or applicable regulation if we are unable to control cost or if our initial cost estimate are incorrect our profitability could be negatively affected particularly under fixed price development contract we may also experience cost underruns which would reduce contract value and related expected revenue and we may be unable to expand the contract scope or secure additional work to offset the resulting lost revenue while contract for development program with complex design and technical challenge are typically cost reimbursable they can be ffp or fpi which can significantly increase our risk of potential negative profit adjustment development contract by nature involve element that have not been undertaken before and thus are highly subject to future unexpected cost growth in addition other contract in backlog are for the transition from development to production which includes starting and stabilizing manufacturing and test line while the final design is still validated over the past several year the dod ha increased it use of other transaction authority ota contract under which it award research and development work without all of the procurement requirement that typically apply to dod contract including justification of sole source award for example raytheon company wa awarded an ota contract for the lower tier air and missile defense sensor ltamds in late otas may use fixed price contract during all phase of the contract or mandated contract cost sharing one third of program cost they may also require non traditional subcontractor participation and impose other requirement that differ from our other dod contract if we are unable to perform on our ota contract including any applicable non traditional requirement it could negatively impact our result of operation financial condition and liquidity from time to time we may begin performance under an undefinitized contract action with not to exceed price prior to completing contract negotiation in order to support government priority uncertainty in final contract price specification and term or loss of negotiating leverage associated with particularly long delay in contract definitization may negatively affect our profitability in addition discussed more fully below our government contract also require to comply with extensive and evolving procurement rule and regulation and subject to potential government audit investigation and dispute we are also involved in program that are classified by the government which have security requirement that place limit on our ability to discus our performance on these program including any risk dispute and claim of contentsour international operation subject to economic risk our result of operation and liquidity may be adversely affected by change in foreign currency fluctuation economic condition political factor trade policy sale method and change in local government regulation we conduct our business on global basis with significant portion of sale derived from international operation including export sale change in local and regional economic condition including fluctuation in exchange rate may affect product demand and reported profit in our non operation transaction may be denominated in local currency in addition currency fluctuation may affect the price we pay supplier for material used in our product result our operating margin also may be negatively impacted by worldwide currency fluctuation that result in higher cost for certain cross border transaction our financial statement are denominated in dollar accordingly fluctuation in exchange rate may also give rise to translation gain or loss when financial statement of non operating unit are translated into dollar strengthening of the dollar other major foreign currency could adversely affect our result of operation in our commercial aerospace business the majority of our sale are consistent with established industry practice transacted in dollar while the majority of cost at location outside the are incurred in the applicable local currency principally the euro the canadian dollar the british pound and the polish zloty for operating unit with dollar sale and local currency cost there is foreign currency exposure that could impact our result of operation depending on market change in the exchange rate of the dollar against the applicable foreign currency in particular pratt whitney canada is especially susceptible to fluctuation in exchange rate for this reason to manage certain exposure we employ long term hedging strategy associated with dollar sale our international sale and operation are subject to risk associated with local government law regulation and policy including those related to tariff and trade barrier investment taxation exchange control capital control employment regulation and cash repatriation government policy on international trade and investment such import quota capital control tax or tariff whether adopted by individual government or regional trade bloc can affect demand for our product and service impact the competitive position of our product or prevent from being able to manufacture or sell product in certain country the implementation of more restrictive trade policy including the imposition of tariff or the renegotiation of existing trade agreement by the or by country where we sell large quantity of product and service or procure supply and other material incorporated into our product including in connection with the united kingdom withdrawal from the european union could negatively impact our business result of operation and financial condition ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and trend such populism and economic nationalism could negatively impact for example government adoption of buy national policy or retaliation by another government against such policy such tariff could have negative impact on our result of operation our international sale and operation are also sensitive to change in foreign national priority including government budget well to regional and local political and economic factor including volatility in energy price change in threat environment and geopolitical uncertainty and change in foreign policy international transaction may involve increased financial and legal risk due to differing legal system and custom and contract law and regulation and include contractual term that differ from those of similar contract in the or that may be interpreted differently in foreign country discussed more fully below our international sale also require to comply with law regulation and policy including the international traffic in arm regulation itar the export administration regulation ear the foreign corrupt practice act fcpa and other anti corruption sanction and export law and regulation in addition in certain foreign country our business engage non employee sale representative from time to time we have dispute with such representative regarding claimed commission and other matter which can result in litigation or arbitration if not resolved amicably we conduct business in certain country primarily for our commercial aerospace business including argentina brazil china india indonesia mexico morocco poland russia south africa turkey ukraine and country in the middle east and central asia that carry high level of currency political compliance and economic risk we expect that sale to these and other emerging market customer will continue to account for significant portion of our commercial aerospace sale in the long term our business evolve and these and other developing nation and region around the world increase their demand for our product particularly our aerospace product operation in emerging market country can present many risk including cultural difference such employment and business practice volatility in gross domestic product economic and government instability particularly in the kingdom of saudi arabia and other middle east country the imposition of exchange and capital control and the risk associated with exporting component manufactured in those country for incorporation into finished product completed in other country while these factor and their impact are difficult to predict any one or more of them could have material adverse effect on our competitive position result of operation cash flow or of contentsfinancial condition of note in the government suspended turkey participation in the joint strike fighter program because turkey accepted delivery of the russian built air and missile defense system the ha imposed and may impose additional sanction on turkey result of this or other political dispute turkish company supply component some of which are sole sourced to our aerospace business for commercial and military engine and aerospace product well to our defense business depending upon the scope and timing of sanction on turkey and potential reciprocal action if any such sanction or action could impact our source of supply and could have material adverse effect on our result of operation cash flow or financial condition in addition in october the people republic of china china announced that it may sanction rtc in connection with possible foreign military sale to taiwan of six reconnaissance pod and related equipment manufactured by collins aerospace foreign military sale are government to government transaction that are initiated by and carried out at the direction of the government to date the chinese government ha not imposed sanction on rtc or indicated the nature or timing of any future potential sanction or other action if china were to impose sanction or take other regulatory action against rtc our supplier teammate or partner it could potentially disrupt our business operation the impact of potential sanction or other action by china can not be determined at this time from time to time our business have sold and are expected to sell in the future additional defense product to taiwan and we are unable to determine the potential impact if any of any future sanction or other action by china in response to these sale our international business face substantial competition from both company and foreign company in some instance foreign company may be owned by foreign government or may receive loan marketing subsidy and other assistance from their government that may not be available to company or our foreign subsidiary in addition foreign company may be subject to fewer restriction on technology transfer than company our international contract particularly for sale of defense product and service may include industrial cooperation agreement requiring specific local purchase manufacturing agreement technology transfer agreement or financial support obligation sometimes in the form of either offset obligation or in country industrial participation icip agreement approval of offset or icip threshold and requirement may be subjective and time consuming and may delay contract award offset requirement may in certain country include the creation of joint venture with local company that may control the venture in addition certain customer demand are increasing for greater offset or icip commitment level higher value content including the transfer of technology and capability and local production and economic development our use of and association with third party foreign representative and consultant for international sale and teaming with international subcontractor partner and supplier in connection with international program expose to various challenge including risk associated with the fcpa and local antibribery law and regulation result of the above factor we could experience financial penalty and award and funding delay on international program our profitability on these program could be negatively affected and we could incur loss on these program that could negatively impact our result of operation financial condition and liquidity our financial performance is dependent on the condition of the aerospace industry our aerospace business constitute substantial portion of our financial result and the performance of those business is directly tied to the economic condition in the commercial aerospace industry which is cyclical in nature capital spending and demand for aircraft engine aerospace product and component aftermarket part and service by commercial airline aircraft operator and aircraft manufacturer are influenced by wide variety of factor including current and predicted traffic level load factor aircraft fuel price labor issue airline profit airline consolidation bankruptcy competition the retirement of older aircraft regulatory change terrorism and related safety concern general economic condition corporate profitability cost reduction effort and remaining performance obligation level in particular tightening of credit in financial market could adversely affect the ability of our customer and supplier to obtain financing for significant purchase and operation could result in decrease in or cancellation of order for our product and service and could impact the ability of our customer to make payment similarly such tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our supplier to experience financial distress or bankruptcy any of these factor could reduce the sale and margin of our aerospace business other factor including future terrorist action aviation safety concern pandemic health issue or major natural disaster could also dramatically reduce the demand for commercial air travel which could negatively impact the sale and margin of our aerospace business for example the covid pandemic ha impacted and continues to impact our business described above additionally because substantial portion of product delivery to commercial aerospace customer are scheduled for delivery in and beyond change in economic condition may cause customer to request that firm order be rescheduled or canceled at time our aerospace business also enter into firm fixed price or cost share development contract which may require to bear cost overrun related to unforeseen technical and design challenge that arise during the development and early production stage of the program in addition our aerospace business face intense competition from domestic and of contentsforeign manufacturer of new equipment and approved non oem aftermarket spare part and repair spare part sale and aftermarket service trend are affected by similar factor including usage pricing technological improvement regulatory change and the retirement of older aircraft furthermore because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing product in these business segment to market we can not predict the economic condition that will exist when any new product is ready to enter into service reduction in spending in the commercial aviation industry could have significant effect on the demand for our product which could have material adverse effect on our competitive position result of operation cash flow or financial condition we design manufacture and service product that incorporate advanced technology the introduction of new product and technology involves risk and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefit initially anticipated competition may reduce our revenue and segment share and limit our future opportunity we seek to achieve growth through the design development production sale and support of innovative commercial aerospace and defense system and product that incorporate advanced technology the product program and service need of our customer change and evolve regularly and we invest substantial amount in research and development effort to pursue advancement in wide range of technology product and service of particular note pratt whitney is currently producing and delivering the geared turbofan engine to power various aircraft including the family of aircraft the level of order received for the geared turbofan family of engine coupled with requirement to achieve mature production level in short time frame require significant additional manufacturing and supply chain capacity if any of our production ramp up effort are delayed if supplier can not timely deliver or perform to our standard and or if we identify or experience issue with in service engine we may not meet customer delivery schedule which could result in material additional cost including liquidated damage or other liability that could be assessed under existing contract our ability to realize the anticipated benefit of our technological advancement depends on variety of factor including meeting development production certification and regulatory approval schedule receiving regulatory approval execution of internal and external performance plan availability of supplier and internally produced part and material performance of supplier and subcontractor availability of supplier and internal facility capacity to perform maintenance repair and overhaul service on our product hiring and training of qualified personnel achieving cost and production efficiency identification of emerging technological trend for our target end customer validation of innovative technology risk associated with the development of complex software the level of customer interest in new technology and product and customer acceptance of product we manufacture or that incorporate technology we develop for example our customer manufacture end product and larger aerospace system that incorporate certain of our aerospace product these system and end product may also incorporate additional technology manufactured by third party and involve additional risk and uncertainty result the performance and industry acceptance of these larger system and end product could affect the level of customer interest in and acceptance of our product in the marketplace in addition many of our product must adhere to strict regulatory and market driven safety and performance standard in variety of jurisdiction the evolving nature of these standard along with the long duration of development production and support program creates uncertainty regarding program profitability particularly with our aircraft engine product development effort divert resource from other potential investment in our business and these effort may not lead to the development of new technology or product on timely basis or meet the need of our customer fully competitive offering in addition the industry for our product or product that incorporate our technology may not develop or grow we anticipate we or our customer supplier or subcontractor may encounter difficulty in developing and producing new product and service and may not realize the degree or timing of benefit initially anticipated or may otherwise suffer significant adverse financial consequence due to the design complexity of our product or those of our customer or third party manufacturer that incorporate our product into or our customer product we may experience delay in completing the development and introduction of new product or we may experience the suspension of production after these product enter into service due to safety concern delay and or suspension of production could result in increased development cost or deflect resource from other project in particular we can not predict with certainty whether when and in quantity our aerospace business will produce and sell aircraft engine aircraft system and component and other product currently in development pending required certification or after entry into service we operate in highly competitive industry and our competitor may have more extensive or more specialized engineering manufacturing marketing and servicing capability than we do our contract are typically awarded on competitive basis our bid are based upon among other item the cost to provide the product and service to generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contract we must be able to accurately estimate our cost to provide the service and deliver the product and to be able to complete the contract in timely manner if we fail to accurately estimate our cost or the time required to complete contract the profitability of our contract may be materially and adversely affected some of our of contentscontracts provide for liquidated damage in the event that we are unable to perform and deliver in accordance with the contractual specification and schedule in addition we may face customer directed cost reduction target that could have material adverse effect on the profitability of our contract if these target are not achieved when required moreover we have seen highly competitive pricing in which bidder may anticipate making substantial investment in program in order to win the work in addition with respect to dod award in particular bid protest from unsuccessful bidder on new program award are frequent generally bid protest will delay the start of contract activity delay earnings and could result in the award decision being overturned and require bid of the contract highly competitive activity within the commercial aerospace industry ha included substantial discount and other financial incentive performance and operating cost guarantee and participation in financing arrangement in order to secure both new engine business and the aftermarket revenue associated with these product furthermore our competitor including our customer may develop competing technology which gain industry acceptance in advance of or instead of our product the possibility also exists that our competitor or customer might develop new technology or offering that might cause our existing technology and offering to become obsolete and cause disruption to our business in addition the possibility exists that competitor or customer will develop aftermarket service and aftermarket part for our product that attract customer and adversely impact our return on investment on new product we also anticipate company continuing to enhance their competitive position against our defense business result of continued domestic and cross border defense industry consolidation and the expansion of competitor capability throughout the supply chain through vertical integration we are also facing heightened competition domestically and internationally from foreign and multinational firm additionally some customer including the dod are increasingly turning to commercial contractor rather than traditional defense contractor for information technology and other support work if we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitor in our core business we may experience decline in revenue and industry segment share any of the foregoing could have material adverse effect on our competitive position result of operation cash flow or financial condition operational riskswe use variety of raw material supplier provided part component sub system and contract manufacturing service in our business and significant shortage supplier capacity constraint supplier production disruption or price increase could increase our operating cost and adversely impact the competitive position of our product our reliance on and non supplier including third party manufacturing supplier subcontractor and service provider and commodity market to secure raw material part component and sub system used in our product expose to volatility in the price and availability of these material and service in many instance we depend upon single source of supply manufacturing service support or assembly or participate in commodity market that may be subject to allocation of limited supply by supplier our defense business are subject to specific procurement requirement that limit the type of material they use which may further limit the supplier and subcontractor they may utilize they also must require supplier to comply with various dod cybersecurity requirement disruption in delivery from our supplier supplier capacity constraint supplier production disruption supplier quality issue such issue with defect or fraudulent part closing bankruptcy or financial difficulty of our supplier price increase or decreased availability of raw material or commodity including result of war natural disaster health pandemic or other business continuity event could have material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitment to customer or increase our operating cost we believe that our supply management and production practice are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risk and the cost of alternative practice nonetheless price increase supplier capacity constraint supplier production disruption or the unavailability of some raw material may have material adverse effect on our competitive position result of operation cash flow or financial condition for example the covid pandemic ha impacted and continues to impact our supply chain described above export and import of certain of our product are subject to various export control sanction and import regulation and may require authorization from the department of state the department of commerce the department of the treasury the department of homeland security the department of justice or regulatory agency of other country we must comply with various law and regulation relating to the export and import of product service and technology from and into the and other country jurisdiction over our operation in the these law and regulation include among others the ear administered by the department of commerce the itar administered by the department of state embargo and sanction regulation administered by the department of the treasury and import regulation administered by the department of homeland security and the department of justice certain of our product service and technology have military or strategic application and are on the munition list of the itar and the of contentscommerce control list of the ear or are otherwise subject to the ear or on the munition import list and we are required to obtain license and authorization from the cognizant government agency before selling these product outside of the or importing these product into the foreign policy or foreign policy of other licensing jurisdiction may affect the licensing process or otherwise prevent from engaging in business dealing with certain individual entity or country any failure by our customer or our supplier to comply with these law and regulation could result in civil or criminal penalty fine seizure of our product adverse publicity restriction on our ability to export or import our product or the suspension or debarment from business with the government moreover any change in export control sanction or import regulation may further restrict the export of our product or service and the possibility of such change requires constant monitoring to ensure we remain compliant our ability to obtain required license and authorization on timely basis or at all is subject to risk and uncertainty including changing government foreign policy or law delay in congressional action or geopolitical and other factor if we are not successful in obtaining or maintaining the necessary license or authorization in timely manner our sale relating to those approval may be prevented or delayed and revenue and profit previously recognized may be reversed any restriction on the export or import of our product or product line could have material adverse effect on our competitive position result of operation cash flow or financial condition our product must meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standard our product and service involve advanced technology in highly sophisticated product the impact of catastrophic product failure or similar event particularly in our commercial aerospace business could be significant actual or perceived design or production issue can result in significant reputational harm to our business in addition to direct warranty maintenance and other cost that may arise significant product issue resulting in injury or death aircraft grounding or similar systemic consequence could have material adverse effect on our business reputation financial position and result of operation we may also incur increased cost delayed payment or lost equipment or service revenue in connection with significant issue with third party product with which our product are integrated there can be no assurance that we or our customer or other third party will not experience operational process or product failure and other problem including through manufacturing or design defect process or other failure of contractor or third party supplier cyber attack or other intentional act any of which could result in potential product safety quality regulatory or environmental risk if our product do not perform intended including with respect to safety or reliability the possible consequence include product recall and product liability claim significant financial loss including fine well diversion of management attention and reputational damage that could reduce demand for our product and service further our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all related cost and we may not otherwise be fully indemnified for them we depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel and our failure to attract train and retain such personnel and to maintain our corporate culture and high ethical standard could seriously harm our business due to the specialized nature of our business our future performance is highly dependent upon the continued service of our key technical personnel and executive officer the development of additional management personnel and the hiring of new qualified technical manufacturing marketing sale and management personnel for our operation our defense business in particular requires qualified personnel with security clearance due to our classified program competition for personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting training or retaining qualified personnel with the requisite skill or security clearance in addition certain existing personnel may be required to receive various security clearance and substantial training in order to work on certain program or perform certain task necessary security clearance may be delayed which may impact our ability to perform on our government contract further we have experienced and may continue to experience personnel reduction result of the covid pandemic impact on our business and significant percentage of our current workforce is nearing or eligible for retirement to the extent that we lose experienced personnel it is critical that we develop other employee hire new qualified personnel and successfully manage the transfer of critical knowledge in addition new qualified personnel may have different expectation from our current workforce which could result in difficulty attracting and retaining new employee loss of key employee failure to attract new qualified employee or adequately train them delay in receiving required security clearance or delay in hiring key personnel could seriously harm our business we believe that critical element of our ability to successfully attract train and retain qualified personnel is our corporate culture which we believe foster innovation collaboration and focus on execution all in an environment of high ethical standard our global operation may present challenge in maintaining these important aspect of our corporate culture any failure to maintain our corporate culture could negatively impact our ability to attract train and retain essential qualified personnel who are vital to our business further we rely on our key personnel to lead with integrity and to meet our high ethical standard that promote excellent performance and cultivate diversity equity and inclusion to the extent any of our key personnel were to behave in way that is inconsistent with our value including with respect to product safety or quality legal or regulatory compliance financial reporting or people management we could experience materially adverse impact to our reputation and our operating result of contentsour business and financial performance may be adversely affected by cyber attack on information technology infrastructure and product our business may be impacted by disruption to our own or third party information technology it infrastructure which could result from among other cause cyber attack on or failure of such infrastructure or compromise to it physical security we also encounter attempt to infiltrate our product and service and sabotage or disable their use by our customer cybersecurity threat are evolving and include but are not limited to both attack on our it infrastructure and attack on the it infrastructure of our customer supplier subcontractor and other third party with whom we do business routinely both on premise and in the cloud attempting to gain unauthorized access to our confidential or other proprietary information classified information

and or availability of the hardware software and information installed stored or transmitted in our product including after the purchase of those product and when they are incorporated into third party product facility or infrastructure and insider threat attack such attack could disrupt our system or those of third party including mission critical system impact business operation result in unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corrupt our data or that of third party we have experienced cyber based attack and due to the evolving threat landscape may continue to experience them going forward potentially with more frequency the threat we face vary from attack common to most industry to more advanced and persistent highly organized adversary including nation state which target and other defense contractor we continue to make investment and adopt measure designed to enhance our protection detection response and recovery capability and to mitigate potential risk to our technology product service and operation from potential cybersecurity threat however given the unpredictability nature and scope of cyber attack it is possible that we are unable to prevent cyber attack that potential vulnerability could go undetected for an extended period that we may be unsuccessful in defending an attack against those vulnerability or that we may otherwise be unable to mitigate customer loss and other potential consequence of these attack in addition some product and service that we provide to customer particularly those related to public security may raise potential liability related to privacy and intellectual property in some case we must rely on the safeguard put in place by our customer supplier subcontractor and other third party to protect against and report cyber threat we could potentially be subject to production downtime operational delay other detrimental impact on our operation or ability to provide product and service to our customer the compromise of confidential information intellectual property or otherwise protected information misappropriation destruction or corruption of data security breach other manipulation or improper use of our or third party system network or product financial loss from remedial action loss of business or potential liability penalty fine and or damage to our reputation any of which could have material adverse effect on our competitive position result of operation cash flow or financial condition some of these risk may be heightened due to the company and it supplier and other third party operating with significant number of employee working remotely due to the evolving nature of such risk the impact of any potential incident can not be predicted further our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all related cost and we may not otherwise be fully indemnified for them our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by threat to our physical security and other event outside our controlwe could encounter threat to our physical security including our facility and personnel and threat from terrorism workplace violence or similar

law further described below the government could suspend from bidding on or receiving award of new government contract pending the completion of legal proceeding if convicted or found liable the government could fine and debar from new government contracting for period generally not to exceed three year and could void any contract found to be tainted by fraud we also could suffer reputational harm if allegation of impropriety were made against even if such allegation are later determined to be unsubstantiated further our government contract are subject to audit and we have received audit report recommending the reduction of certain contract price because for example cost or pricing data disclosure or cost accounting practice used to price and negotiate those contract may not have conformed to government regulation some of these audit report recommend that certain payment be repaid delayed or withheld and may involve substantial amount which could if the audit report theory

competitiveness cause reputational harm and expose to substantial fine or other penalty accounting tax and insurance related riskswe use estimate in accounting for many of our program and change in our estimate could adversely affect our future financial result accounting for long term contract and related asset requires estimate and judgment related to our progress toward completion and the long term performance on the contract significant judgment include potential risk associated with the ability and cost to achieve program schedule including customer directed delay or reduction in scheduled delivery and technical and other specific contract requirement including customer activity level and variable consideration based upon that activity due to the size and long term nature of many of our contract the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variable management must make assumption and estimate regarding contract revenue and cost such estimate of variable consideration including award fee and penalty including with respect to labor productivity and availability the complexity and scope of the work to be performed the availability and cost of material the length of time to complete the performance obligation execution by our subcontractor the availability and timing of funding from our customer overhead cost rate and current and past service cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful life of component among other variable because of the significance of management judgment and estimation process described above it is likely that materially different amount could be recorded if we used different assumption or if the underlying circumstance were to change change in underlying assumption circumstance or estimate may adversely affect our future result of operation and financial condition significant change in key estimate and assumption such discount rate and assumed long term return on plan asset roa well our actual investment return on our pension plan asset and other actuarial factor could affect our earnings equity and pension contribution in future period we must determine our pension and other postretirement benefit prb plan expense or income which involves significant judgment particularly with respect to our discount rate long term roa and other actuarial assumption the discount rate assumption is set annually and we determine on an annual basis whether it is appropriate to change our long term roa assumption these assumption and other actuarial assumption may change significantly due to change in economic legislative and or demographic experience or circumstance change in our assumption could result in negative change to our pension and prb plan expense and funded status and our cash contribution to such plan which would negatively impact our result of operation in addition difference between our actual investment return and our long term roa assumption would result in change to our pension and prb plan expense and funded status and our required contribution to the plan our plan asset are invested in accordance with our investment management objective and are subject to market volatility and other condition the difference may also be impacted by change in regulatory accounting and other requirement applicable to pension additional tax expense or additional tax exposure could affect our future profitability we are subject to income tax in the united state and international jurisdiction significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income tax in the ordinary course of our business there are transaction and calculation where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain change in tax law and regulation well change and conflict in related interpretation and other tax guidance and fluctuation in taxable income could materially impact our tax

with the integration of utc and raytheon company legacy business which may make it more difficult for to achieve the anticipated benefit of the raytheon merger fully or within the anticipated time frame the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expense and the anticipated benefit of the integration plan may not be realized on timely basis while we have assumed that certain level of expense would be incurred many of the expense that may be incurred are by their nature difficult to estimate accurately and change to the estimate could affect the total amount or timing of

industrial economic and political factor on both regional and global level our operation include original equipment manufacturer oem and extensive related aftermarket part and service related to our aerospace operation our defense business serf both domestic and international customer primarily prime contractor or subcontractor on broad portfolio of defense and related program for government customer our business mix also reflects the combination of shorter cycle in our commercial aerospace spare contract and certain service contract in our defense business primarily at ri and longer cycle in our aerospace oem and aftermarket maintenance contract and on our defense contract to design develop manufacture or modify complex equipment our customer are in the public and private sector and our business reflect an extensive geographic diversification that ha evolved with continued globalization government legislation policy and regulation including regulation related to global warming carbon footprint and fuel efficiency can have negative impact on our worldwide operation government and industry driven safety and performance regulation restriction on aircraft engine noise and emission government imposed travel restriction and government procurement practice can impact our business collins aerospace and pratt whitney serve both commercial and government aerospace customer revenue passenger mile rpm available seat mile and the general economic health of airline carrier are key barometer for our commercial aerospace operation performance in the general aviation

in policy position or priority from new administration and the global political environment total sale to the government excluding foreign military sale fm were billion billion and billion in and or and of total net sale for those year respectively impact of the covid pandemicin march the coronavirus disease covid wa declared pandemic by the world health organization and national emergency by the government the pandemic ha negatively affected the and global economy disrupted global supply chain and financial market and resulted in significant travel restriction mandated facility closure and shelter in place and social distancing order in numerous jurisdiction around the world raytheon technology is taking all prudent measure to protect the health and safety of our employee such practicing social distancing performing deep cleaning in all of our facility temperature screening health questionnaire and enabling our employee to work from home where possible we have also taken appropriate action to help support our community in addressing the challenge posed by the pandemic including the production and donation of personal protective equipment our business and operation and the industry in which we operate have been significantly impacted by public and private sector policy and initiative in the and worldwide to address the transmission of covid such the imposition of travel restriction and the adoption of remote working additionally public sentiment regarding air travel have also had significant impact we began to experience issue related to covid in the first quarter of primarily related to limited number of facility closure le than full staffing and disruption in supplier delivery most significantly in our collins aerospace and pratt whitney business the continued disruption to air travel and commercial activity and the significant restriction and limitation on business particularly within the aerospace and commercial airline industry have negatively impacted global supply demand and distribution capability these condition which began in the second quarter of continued through the remainder of in particular the unprecedented decrease in air travel resulting from the covid pandemic is adversely affecting our airline and airframer customer and their demand for the product and service of our collins aerospace and pratt whitney business based on recent public data revenue passenger mile rpm declined by approximately in the first eleven month of compared to the prior year due to the pandemic result our airline customer have reported significant reduction in fleet utilization aircraft grounding and unplanned retirement and have deferred and in some case cancelled new aircraft delivery airline have shifted to cash conservation behavior such deferring engine maintenance due to lower flight hour and aircraft utilization requesting extended payment term deferring delivery of new aircraft and spare engine and requesting discount on engine maintenance some airline customer have filed for bankruptcy due to their inability to meet their financial obligation additionally we are seeing purchase order decline in line with publicly communicated aircraft production volume original equipment manufacturer oem customer delay and cancel order we continue to monitor these trend and are working closely with our customer we have been and continue to actively mitigate cost and adjust production schedule to accommodate these decline in demand we have also been taking action to preserve capital and protect the long term need of our business including cutting discretionary spending significantly reducing capital expenditure and research and development spend suspending our share buyback in deferring merit increase and implementing temporary pay reduction freezing non essential hiring repositioning employee to defense work furloughing employee when needed and personnel reduction in we recorded total restructuring charge of million primarily related to personnel reduction at our collins aerospace and pratt whitney business to preserve capital and at our corporate headquarters due to consolidation from the raytheon merger the former raytheon company business although experiencing minor impact have not experienced significant facility closure or other significant business disruption result of the covid pandemic given the impact described above that have resulted from the covid pandemic we expect our future operating result particularly those of our collins aerospace and pratt whitney business to continue to be significantly negatively impacted our expectation regarding the covid pandemic and it potential financial impact are based on available information and assumption that we believe are reasonable at this time however the actual financial impact is highly uncertain and subject to wide range of factor and future development while we believe that the long term outlook for the aerospace industry remains positive due to the fundamental driver of air travel demand there is significant uncertainty with respect to when commercial air traffic level will begin to recover and whether and at what point capacity will return to and or exceed pre covid level our latest estimate are that this recovery may occur in or new information may emerge concerning the of contentsscope severity and duration of the covid pandemic well any worsening of the pandemic the effect of mutating strain and whether additional outbreak of the pandemic will continue to occur action to contain the pandemic spread or treat it impact timing of the availability of vaccine and their distribution acceptance and efficacy and governmental business and individual personal action taken in response to the pandemic including restriction and limitation on travel and transportation and change in leisure and business travel pattern and work environment among others some of these action and related impact may be trend that continue in the future even after the pandemic no longer pose significant public health risk we considered the deterioration in general economic and market condition primarily due to the covid pandemic to be triggering event in the first and second quarter of requiring an impairment evaluation of goodwill intangible asset and other asset in our commercial aerospace business collins aerospace and pratt whitney beginning in the second quarter of we observed several airline customer bankruptcy delay and cancellation of aircraft purchase by airline fleet retirement and repositioning of oem production schedule and we experienced significant decline in revenue at our collins aerospace and pratt whitney business due to decline in flight hour aircraft fleet utilization shop visit and commercial oem delivery these factor contributed to deterioration of our expectation regarding the timing of return to pre covid commercial flight activity which further reduced our future sale and cash flow expectation based on our updated forecast assumption in the second quarter of we concluded that the carrying value of two of our collins aerospace reporting unit were greater than their respective fair value and accordingly recorded goodwill impairment charge of billion we did not identify any further deterioration to our expectation in the third quarter of and therefore did not have triggering event we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing of october and determined that no additional adjustment to the carrying value of our goodwill were necessary refer to note acquisition disposition goodwill and intangible asset within item of this form for additional information described further in note commercial aerospace industry asset and commitment within item of this form we have significant exposure related to our airline and airframer customer including significant account receivable and contract asset balance given the uncertainty related to the severity and length of the pandemic well any worsening of the pandemic mutation to the strain of the virus and the timing and impact of vaccine and whether there will be additional outbreak of the pandemic and it impact across the aerospace industry we may be required to record additional charge or impairment in future period for discussion on the impact see note basis of presentation and summary of accounting principle within item of this form although the impact of covid on our commercial business is significant we currently believe we have sufficient liquidity to withstand the current estimated impact other mattersglobal economic and political condition change in raw material and commodity price interest rate foreign currency exchange rate energy cost level of air travel the financial condition of commercial airline and the impact from natural disaster and weather condition create uncertainty that could impact our business in with regard to political condition in july the government suspended turkey participation in the joint strike fighter program because turkey accepted delivery of the russian built air and missile defense system the ha imposed and may impose additional sanction on turkey result of this or other political dispute turkish company supply with component some of which are sole sourced primarily in our aerospace operation for commercial and military engine and aerospace product depending upon the scope and timing of sanction on turkey and potential reciprocal action if any such sanction or action could impact our source of supply and could have material adverse effect on our result of operation cash flow or financial condition in addition in october the people republic of china china announced that it may sanction rtc in connection with possible foreign military sale to taiwan of six reconnaissance pod and related equipment manufactured by collins aerospace foreign military sale are government to government transaction that are initiated by and carried out at the direction of the government to date the chinese government ha not imposed sanction on rtc or indicated the nature or timing of any future potential sanction or other action if china were to impose sanction or take other regulatory action against rtc our supplier teammate or partner it could potentially disrupt our business operation the impact of potential sanction or other action by china can not be determined at this time the recent presidential and congressional election could result in change to the government foreign policy that may impact regulatory approval for direct commercial sale contract for certain of our product and service to certain foreign customer likewise it is uncertain whether approval previously granted for prior sale could also be paused or revoked if the product and service have not yet been delivered to the customer if we ultimately do not receive all of the regulatory approval or those approval are revoked it could have material effect on our financial result of contentsin particular we have direct commercial sale contract for precision guided munition with certain middle east customer for which we have not yet obtained regulatory approval due to the result of the presidential and congressional election and the resulting uncertainty surrounding foreign policy on direct commercial sale for precision guided munition with this customer we determined that it is no longer probable that we will be able to obtain required regulatory approval for these contract however this determination could change the government foreign policy view are clarified therefore in the fourth quarter of we reversed million of sale for work performed on these specific contract subsequent to the date of the raytheon merger and through the end of the third quarter of and the related operating profit in addition we recognized an unfavorable profit impact of million primarily related to inventory reserve contract asset impairment and recognition of supplier related obligation related to termination liability which we now do not expect to be utilized or otherwise directed to other customer in addition we reversed million of backlog on these contract our contract liability include million of advance payment received from the customer on these contract which may become refundable to the customer if the contract are ultimately terminated see item risk factor within part of this form for further discussion of these item financial summarywe use the following key financial performance measure to manage our business on consolidated basis and by business segment and to monitor and ass our result of operation net sale growth metric that measure our revenue for the current year operating profit measure of our profit from continuing operation for the year before non operating expense net and income tax and operating margin measure of our operating profit percentage of total net sale dollar in million net sale operating profit loss operating margin operating cash flow from continuing operation total backlog which is equivalent to our remaining performance obligation for our contract represents the dollar value of firm order for which work ha not been performed and excludes unexercised contract option and potential order under ordering type contract indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq type contract backlog generally increase with booking and or order and generally convert into sale we incur cost under the related contractual commitment for our contract recognized over time or product are transferred to our customer for point in time contract backlog is affected by change in foreign exchange rate in addition we maintain strong focus on program execution and the prudent management of capital and investment in order to maximize operating income and cash we focus on adjusted earnings per share eps and measure to ass our cash generation and the efficiency and effectiveness of our use of capital such free cash flow fcf and return on invested capital roic all of which are not defined measurement under generally accepted accounting principle gaap and may be calculated differently by other company considered together we believe these metric are strong indicator of our overall performance and our ability to create shareowner value we feel these measure are balanced among long term and short term performance efficiency and growth we also use these and other performance metric for executive compensation purpose discussion of our result of operation and financial condition follows below in result of operation segment review and liquidity and financial condition result of operationsas described in our cautionary note concerning factor that may affect

total net eac adjustment result of the raytheon merger ri and rmd long term contract that are accounted for on percentage of completion basis were reset to zero percent complete of the merger date

and potential order under ordering type contract idiq type contract defense backlog is affected by change in foreign exchange rate defense booking generally represent the dollar value of new external defense contract awarded to during the reporting period and include firm order for which funding ha not been appropriated we believe defense booking are an important measure of future performance for our defense operation and are an indicator of potential future change in these operation total net sale because we can not record revenue under new contract without first having booking in the current

to backlog in the period in which the cancellation or termination occurs and the impact is determinable contract cancellation and termination also include contract underruns on cost type program defense booking are impacted by the timing and amount of award in given period which are subject to numerous factor including the desired capability by the customer and urgency of customer need customer budget and other fiscal constraint political and economic and other environmental factor the timing of customer negotiation the timing of governmental approval and notification and the timing of option exercise or increase in scope in addition due to these factor quarterly booking tend to fluctuate from period to period particularly on segment basis result we believe comparing booking on

protect the long term need of our business although our business ha been and will continue to be significantly impacted by covid we currently believe we have sufficient liquidity to withstand the potential impact the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act care act along with earlier issued irs guidance provides for net deferral of payroll tax payment we did not realize any cash flow benefit in and do not expect an impact to future year cash flow from net deferral of payroll tax payment in addition deferral of required estimated federal foreign and state income tax payment due to the care act and other similar state and foreign stimulus incentive only impacted the timing of these payment within the year the care act among other thing also contains numerous other provision

reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense management belief the most complex and sensitive judgment because of their significance to the consolidated financial statement result primarily from the need to make estimate about the effect of matter that are inherently uncertain the most significant area involving management judgment and estimate are described below actual result in these area could differ from management estimate long term contract accounting we recognize revenue on an over time basis for substantially all defense contract and certain long term aerospace aftermarket contract we measure progress toward completion of these contract on percentage of completion basis using cost incurred to date relative to total estimated cost at completion incurred cost represent work performed which correspond with and best depict transfer of control to the customer contract cost are incurred over period of time which can be several year and the estimation of these cost requires management judgment we review our estimate at completion eacs on significant contract on periodic basis and for others no le than annually or when change in circumstance warrant modification to previous estimate due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the company performance obligation the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex subject to many variable and requires significant judgment by management on contract by contract basis part of this process management review information including but not limited to any outstanding key contract matter progress towards completion and the related program schedule identified risk and opportunity and the related change in estimate of revenue and cost the risk and opportunity relate to management judgment about the ability and cost to achieve the schedule consideration of customer directed delay or reduction in scheduled delivery technical requirement customer activity level such flight hour or aircraft landing and related variable consideration management judgment related to these consideration ha become increasingly more significant given the current economic environment primarily caused by the covid pandemic management must make assumption and estimate regarding contract revenue and cost including estimate of labor productivity and availability the complexity and scope of the work to be performed the availability and cost of material the length of time to complete the performance obligation execution by our subcontractor the availability and timing of funding from our customer overhead cost rate and current and past maintenance cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful life of component among others in particular fixed price development program involve significant management judgment development contract by nature have element that have not been done before and thus are highly subject to future unexpected cost growth cost estimate may also include the estimated cost of satisfying our industrial cooperation agreement sometimes in the form of either offset obligation or in country industrial participation icip agreement required under certain contract primarily within our ri and rmd segment these obligation may or may not be distinct depending on their nature if cash is paid to customer to satisfy our offset obligation it is recorded reduction in the transaction price change in estimate of net sale cost of sale and the related impact to operating profit are recognized on cumulative catch up basis which recognizes the cumulative effect of the profit change on current and prior period based on performance obligation percentage of completion in the current period significant change in one or more of these estimate could affect the profitability of one or more of our performance obligation our eac adjustment also include the establishment of loss provision on our contract accounted for on percentage of completion basis net eac adjustment had the following impact on our operating result dollar in million except per share amount profit loss income loss from continuing operation attributable to common shareowner diluted earnings loss per share from continuing operation attributable to common shareowner amount reflect statutory tax rate of which approximates our tax rate on our eac adjustment result of the raytheon merger raytheon company contract accounted for on percentage of completion basis were reset to zero percent complete of the merger date since only the unperformed portion of the contract at the merger date represents the obligation of the company for additional information related to the raytheon merger see note acquisition disposition goodwill and intangible asset within item of this form cost incurred for engineering and development of aerospace product under contract with customer are capitalized contract fulfillment cost to the extent recoverable from the associated contract margin and customer funding and subsequently amortized the oem product are delivered to the customer the estimation of contract margin requires management judgment we regularly ass capitalized contract fulfillment cost for impairment of contentsincome tax management belief that our earnings during the period when the temporary difference become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefit which may be realized over an extended period of time for those jurisdiction where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating result indicate that realization is not likely valuation allowance is provided in assessing the need for valuation allowance we estimate future taxable income considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategy and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards valuation allowance related to deferred tax asset can be affected by change to tax law change to statutory tax rate and future taxable income level in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or portion of our deferred tax asset in the future we would reduce such amount through an increase to tax expense in the period in which that determination is made or when tax law change are enacted conversely if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax asset in the future in excess of the net carrying amount we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through decrease to tax expense in the period in which that determination is made in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax position we ass our income tax position and record tax benefit for all year subject to examination based upon management evaluation of the fact circumstance and information available at the reporting date for those tax position where it is more likely than not that tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with taxing authority that ha full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax position where it is not more likely than not that tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit ha been recognized in the financial statement in addition we have entered into certain internal legal entity restructuring transaction necessary to effectuate the separation transaction we have accrued tax on these transaction based on our interpretation of the applicable tax law and our determination of appropriate entity valuation see note basis of presentation and summary of accounting principle and note income tax within item of this form for further discussion management ha determined that the distribution of carrier and otis on april and certain related internal business separation transaction qualified tax free under applicable law in making these determination we applied the tax law in the relevant jurisdiction to our fact and circumstance and obtained tax ruling from the relevant taxing authority tax opinion and or other external tax advice related to the concluded tax treatment if the completed distribution of carrier or otis in each case or certain internal business separation transaction were to fail to qualify for tax free treatment the company could be subject to significant liability and there could be material adverse impact on the company business financial condition result of operation and cash flow in future reporting period goodwill and intangible asset the asset and liability of acquired business are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition goodwill represents cost in excess of fair value assigned to the underlying identifiable net asset of acquired business intangible asset acquired in business combination consist of patent trademark tradenames developed technology customer relationship and other intangible asset the fair value for acquired customer relationship intangible is determined of the acquisition date based on estimate and judgment regarding expectation for the future after tax cash flow arising from the follow on revenue from customer relationship that existed on the acquisition date over their estimated life including the probability of expected future contract renewal and revenue le contributory asset charge all of which is discounted to present value the fair value of the trademark and tradename intangible asset are determined utilizing the relief from royalty method which is form of the income approach under this method royalty rate based on observed market royalty is applied to projected revenue supporting the tradename and discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate see note basis of presentation and summary of accounting principle within item of this form for further detail we applied these approach to the valuation of intangible for the raytheon merger for which the most significant intangible asset identified were customer relationship and tradenames specific to these intangible asset our estimate of market participant future cash flow included forecasted revenue growth rate remaining developmental effort operational performance including company specific synergy program life cycle material and labor pricing and other relevant customer contractual and market factor for the customer relationship where appropriate the net cash flow were probability adjusted to reflect the uncertainty associated with the underlying assumption including cancellation rate related to backlog government demand for sole source and recompete contract and win rate for recompete contract well the risk profile of the net cash flow utilized in the valuation in addition the net cash flow were discounted using an appropriate discount rate that requires judgment by management the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible asset acquired in connection with the raytheon merger wa approximately billion also included within intangible asset are exclusivity asset which are payment made to secure certain contractual right to provide product on new commercial aerospace platform such payment are capitalized when there are distinct right obtained and there are sufficient incremental cash flow to support the recoverability of the asset established otherwise the applicable of contentsportion of the payment are expensed the gross value of these contractual commitment at december wa approximately billion of which approximately billion ha been paid to date we regularly ass the recoverability of these intangible which is dependent upon our assumption around the future success and profitability of the underlying aircraft platform including the associated aftermarket revenue stream and the related future cash flow goodwill and intangible asset deemed to have indefinite life are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing annually or more frequently if event or change in circumstance indicate the asset might be impaired the impairment test compare carrying value of the reporting unit to it estimated fair value if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the carrying value is reduced to fair value in developing our estimate for the fair value of our reporting unit significant judgment is required in the determination of the appropriateness of using qualitative assessment or quantitative assessment for the quantitative assessment that are performed fair value is primarily based on income approach using discounted cash flow method and relief from royalty method which have significant assumption including sale growth rate projected operating profit terminal growth rate discount rate and royalty rate such assumption are subject to variability from year to year and are directly impacted by among other thing global market condition we considered the deterioration in general economic and market condition primarily due to the covid pandemic to be triggering event in the first and second quarter of requiring an impairment evaluation of goodwill intangible asset and other asset in our commercial aerospace business collins aerospace and pratt whitney beginning in the second quarter of we observed several airline customer bankruptcy delay and cancellation of aircraft purchase by airline fleet retirement and repositioning of oem production schedule and we experienced significant decline in revenue at our collins aerospace and pratt whitney business due to decline in flight hour aircraft fleet utilization shop visit and commercial oem delivery these factor contributed to deterioration of our expectation regarding the timing of return to pre covid commercial flight activity which further reduced our future sale and cash flow expectation in the second quarter of we evaluated the collins aerospace and pratt whitney reporting unit for goodwill impairment and determined that the carrying value of two of the six collins aerospace reporting unit exceeded the sum of discounted future cash flow resulting in goodwill impairment of billion collins aerospace discounted future cash flow estimate were developed for three scenario base case downside case and an upside case these scenario included assumption regarding future airline flight activity out of warranty hour on original equipment expected repair upgrade and replacement future oem manufacturing schedule and related environmental assumption including individual desire to return to normal travel business need to travel and potential cure or vaccine to prevent or reduce the effect of covid these estimate require significant amount of judgment and are subject to change based upon factor outside our control we weighted the three scenario follows for the base case for the downside case and for the upside case and used these weighting we believed they reflected the risk and opportunity relative to our estimate goodwill impairment wa not indicated for any of the other reporting unit evaluated for impairment in any of these scenario we did not identify any further deterioration to our expectation in the third quarter of and therefore did not have triggering event on october we changed our annual goodwill impairment testing date from july to october to better align with the timing of our annual long term planning process this change wa not material to our consolidated financial statement it did not delay accelerate or avoid any potential goodwill impairment charge we completed our annual impairment testing of october where we assessed our pratt whitney ri rmd and one of the collins aerospace reporting unit using qualitative factor to determine whether it wa more likely than not that any individual reporting unit fair value is le than it carrying value step and determined that no further testing wa required based on there being no significant change at ri and rmd since the acquisition of raytheon company and the substantial cushion of fair value over book value at the other reporting unit for the remainder of our collins aerospace reporting unit we compared the fair value of the reporting unit to their respective carrying value step and determined that no additional adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill were necessary based on our annual impairment analysis of october the reporting unit that wa closest to impairment wa reporting unit at collins aerospace with fair value in excess of book value including goodwill of billion or all other factor equal if the discount rate used for the annual impairment analysis increased by basis point the fair value in excess of book value for the collins aerospace reporting unit would have been approximately billion or alternatively all other factor equal if the cash flow were decreased by the fair value for the collins aerospace reporting unit would have decreased by approximately billion material change in these estimate could occur and result in additional impairment in future period the company continuously monitor for event and circumstance that could negatively impact the key assumption in determining the fair value of goodwill including long term revenue growth projection profitability discount rate recent market valuation from transaction by comparable company volatility in the company market capitalization and general of contentsindustry market and macro economic condition it is possible that future change in such circumstance including more prolonged and or severe covid pandemic than originally anticipated or future change in the variable associated with the judgment assumption and estimate used in assessing the fair value of our reporting unit including the expected long term recovery of airline travel to pre covid level would require the company to record non cash impairment charge contingent liability our operating unit include business which sell product and service and conduct operation throughout the world described in note commitment and contingency within item of this form contractual regulatory and other matter in the normal course of business may arise that subject to claim or litigation of note the design development production and support of new aerospace technology is inherently complex and subject to risk since the geared turbofan engine entered into service in technical issue have been identified and experienced with the engine which is typical for new engine and new aerospace technology pratt whitney ha addressed these issue through various improvement and modification these issue have resulted in financial impact including increased warranty provision customer contract settlement and reduction in contract performance estimate additional technical issue either related to this program or other program may also arise in the normal course which may result in financial impact that could be material to the company financial position result of operation and cash flow additionally we have significant contract with the government subject to government oversight and audit which may require significant adjustment of contract price we accrue for liability associated with these matter when it is probable that liability ha been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated the most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of then currently available fact with respect to each matter when no amount within range of estimate is more likely the minimum is accrued the inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matter can result in amount materially different from any provision made with respect to their resolution employee benefit plan we sponsor domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and prb plan assumption used to calculate our funded status are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicator they are evaluated annually at december and when significant event require mid year remeasurement change in any of these assumption or actual experience that differs from these assumption are subject to recognition in pension and postretirement net periodic benefit income expense reported in the consolidated financial statement assumption used in the accounting for these employee benefit plan require judgement major assumption include the discount rate and eroa other assumption include mortality rate demographic assumption such retirement age rate of increase in employee compensation level and health care cost increase projection the weighted average discount rate used to measure pension and prb liability are based on yield curve developed using high quality corporate bond well plan specific cash flow for our significant plan we utilize full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service cost and interest cost component of net periodic benefit expense by applying the specific spot rate along the yield curve used in determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant discounted projected cash flow the following table show the sensitivity of our pension and prb plan liability and net periodic benefit income to basis point change in the discount rate for benefit obligation interest cost and service cost of december dollar in million increase in discount rate of bpsdecrease in discount rate of bpsprojected benefit obligation net periodic benefit income the discount rate sensitivity assume no change in the shape of the yield curve that will be applied to the projected cash outflow for future benefit payment in order to calculate interest and service cost flattening of the yield curve result in narrowing of the spread between interest and obligation discount rate and would decrease our net periodic benefit income conversely steepening of the yield curve would result in an increase in the spread between interest and obligation discount rate and would increase our net periodic benefit income the eroa is the average rate of earnings expected over the long term on asset invested to fund anticipated future benefit payment obligation in determining the eroa assumption we consider the target asset allocation of plan asset well economic and other indicator of future performance we may consult with and consider the opinion of financial and other professional in determining the appropriate capital market assumption return projection are validated using simulation model that incorporates yield curve credit spread and risk premium to project long term prospective return difference between actual asset return in given year and the eroa do not necessarily indicate change in the assumption is required the eroa represents the expected average return over long term horizon net periodic benefit income is also sensitive to change in the eroa an increase or decrease of basis point in the eroa would have increased or decreased our net periodic benefit income by approximately million of contentswe must apply both financial accounting standard fa requirement under gaap described above and government cost accounting standard ca requirement to calculate pension and prb expense both fa and ca expense use long term assumption requiring judgement but the ca expense calculation is different from the fa requirement and calculation methodology while the ultimate liability for pension cost under fa and ca is similar the pattern of cost recognition is different our ca pension expense is comprised primarily of ca service cost well amortization amount resulting from demographic or economic experience different than expected change in assumption or change in plan provision ca requires contractor to compare the liability using discount rate based on the eroa to liability using discount rate based on high quality corporate bond and use the greater of the two liability calculation in developing ca expense additionally unlike fa ca expense is only recognized for plan that are not fully funded consequently if plan become or cease to be fully funded under ca due to our asset or liability experience our ca expense will change accordingly accounting standardsfor discussion of recent accounting pronouncement see the accounting pronouncement section in note basis of presentation and

contentsenvironmental mattersour operation are subject to environmental regulation by federal state and local authority in the united state and regulatory authority with jurisdiction over our foreign operation result we have established and continually update policy relating to environmental standard of performance for our operation worldwide we believe that expenditure necessary to comply with the present regulation governing environmental protection will not have material effect upon our competitive position result of operation cash flow or financial condition we have been identified potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla more commonly known superfund for number of site the nature and extent of environmental concern vary from site to site and our share of responsibility varies from sole responsibility to very little responsibility in estimating our liability for remediation we consider our likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of other potentially responsible party to fulfill their obligation we also lease certain government owned property and generally are not liable for remediation of preexisting environmental contamination at these site result we generally do not provide for these cost in our consolidated financing statement at december and we had million and million reserved for environmental remediation respectively cash outflow for environmental remediation were million in million in and million in we estimate that ongoing environmental remediation expenditure in each of the next two year will not exceed approximately million government mattersas described above in critical accounting estimate contingent liability our contract with the government are subject to audit such audit may recommend that certain contract price should be reduced to comply with various government regulation or that certain payment be delayed or withheld we are also the subject of one or more investigation and legal proceeding initiated by the government with respect to government contract matter see item legal proceeding within part and note income tax and note commitment and contingency within item of this form for further discussion of these and other government matter item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskour primary market exposure are to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate it relates to our market risk sensitive instrument which are primarily cash debt and derivative instrument to quantify our market risk exposure we perform sensitivity analysis based on hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate we changed our methodology for quantifying our market risk exposure in the second quarter of to better align with how we manage our risk exposure refer to note basis of presentation and summary of accounting principle note borrowing and line of credit and note financial instrument within item of this form for additional discussion of foreign currency exchange interest rate and financial instrument foreign currency exchange rate risk we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipt from customer and payment to supplier in foreign currency and to various internal or external financing arrangement we use foreign currency forward contract to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payment and receipt related to our ongoing business and financing we actively manage foreign currency exposure that are associated with committed foreign currency purchase and sale and other asset and liability created in the normal course of business at the operating unit level more than insignificant exposure that can not be naturally offset within an operating unit are hedged with foreign currency derivative foreign exchange exposure arising from intercompany loan and deposit transaction are also hedged regularly the aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedge wa billion and billion at december and respectively foreign currency forward contract are sensitive to change in foreign currency exchange rate unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency contract would have resulted in an increase in unrealized loss of billion and billion at december and respectively such loss or gain would be offset by corresponding gain or loss in the remeasurement of the underlying transaction being hedged we believe these foreign currency forward exchange contract and the offsetting underlying commitment when taken together do not create material market riskwithin our aerospace business our sale are typically denominated in dollar however for our non based entity such pratt whitney canada wc substantial portion of their cost are incurred in local currency consequently there is foreign currency exchange impact and risk to operational result dollar must be converted to local currency such the canadian dollar in order to meet local currency cost obligation additionally we transact business in various foreign currency which expose our cash flow and earnings to change in foreign currency exchange rate in order to minimize the exposure that exists from change in the exchange rate of the dollar against these other currency we hedge of contentsa certain portion of sale to secure the rate at which dollar will be converted the majority of this hedging activity occurs at wc and collins aerospace and hedging activity also occurs to lesser extent at the remainder of pratt whitney at wc and collins aerospace firm and forecasted sale for both original equipment and spare part are hedged at varying amount for up to month on the dollar sale exposure represented by the excess of dollar sale over dollar denominated purchase hedging gain and loss resulting from movement in foreign currency exchange rate are partially offset by the foreign currency translation impact that are generated on the translation of local currency operating result into dollar for reporting purpose while the objective of the hedging program is to minimize the foreign currency exchange impact on operating result there are typically variance between the hedging gain or loss and the translational impact due to the length of hedging contract change in the sale profile volatility in the exchange rate and other such operational consideration interest rate risk we have financial instrument that are subject to interest rate risk principally fixed rate debt obligation basis point unfavorable interest rate movement would have had an approximate billion impact on the fair value of our fixed rate debt at both december and the investor in our fixed rate debt obligation do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligation prior to maturity therefore exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed rate debt from time to time we may hedge to floating rate using interest rate swap currently we do not hold any derivative contract that hedge our interest exposure but may consider such strategy in the future of contentsitem financial statement and supplementary datamanagement report on internal control over financial reportingthe management of

raytheon technology is taking all prudent measure to protect the health and safety of our employee such practicing social distancing performing deep cleaning in all of our facility temperature screening health questionnaire and enabling our employee to work from home where possible we have also taken appropriate action to help support our community in addressing the challenge posed by the pandemic including the production and donation of personal protective equipment our business and operation and the industry in which we operate have been significantly impacted by public and private sector policy and initiative in the and worldwide to address the transmission of covid such the imposition of travel restriction and the adoption of remote working additionally public sentiment regarding air travel have also had significant impact we began to experience issue related to covid in the first quarter of primarily related to limited number of facility closure le than full staffing and disruption in supplier delivery most significantly in our collins aerospace system collins aerospace and pratt whitney business the continued disruption to air travel and commercial activity and the significant restriction and limitation on business particularly within the aerospace and commercial airline industry have negatively impacted global supply demand and distribution capability these condition which began in the second quarter of continued through the remainder of in particular the unprecedented decrease in air travel resulting from the covid pandemic is adversely affecting our airline and airframer customer and their demand for the product and service of our collins aerospace and pratt whitney business based on recent public data revenue passenger mile rpm declined by approximately in the first eleven month of compared to the prior year due to the pandemic result our airline customer have reported significant reduction in fleet utilization aircraft grounding and unplanned retirement and have deferred and in some case cancelled new aircraft delivery airline have shifted to cash conservation behavior such deferring engine maintenance due to lower flight hour and aircraft utilization requesting extended payment term deferring delivery of new aircraft and spare engine and of contentsrequesting discount on engine maintenance some airline customer have filed for bankruptcy due to their inability to meet their financial obligation additionally we are seeing purchase order decline in line with publicly communicated aircraft production volume original equipment manufacturer oem customer delay and cancel order we continue to monitor these trend and are working closely with our customer we have been and continue to actively mitigate cost and adjust production schedule to accommodate these decline in demand we have also been taking action to preserve capital and protect the long term need of our business including cutting discretionary spending significantly reducing capital expenditure and research and development spend suspending our share buyback in deferring merit increase and implementing temporary pay reduction freezing non essential hiring repositioning employee to defense work furloughing employee when needed and personnel reduction in we recorded total restructuring charge of million primarily related to personnel reduction at our collins aerospace and pratt whitney business to preserve capital and at our corporate headquarters due to consolidation from the raytheon merger the former raytheon company business although experiencing minor impact have not experienced significant facility closure or other significant business disruption result of the covid pandemic given the impact described above that have resulted from the covid pandemic we expect our future operating result particularly those of our collins aerospace and pratt whitney business to continue to be significantly negatively impacted our expectation regarding the covid pandemic and it potential financial impact are based on available information and assumption that we believe are reasonable at this time however the actual financial impact is highly uncertain and subject to wide range of factor and future development while we believe that the long term outlook for the aerospace industry remains positive due to the fundamental driver of air travel demand there is significant uncertainty with respect to when commercial air traffic level will begin to recover and whether and at what point capacity will return to and or exceed pre covid level our latest estimate are that this recovery may occur in or new information may emerge concerning the scope severity and duration of the covid pandemic well any worsening of the pandemic the effect of mutating strain and whether additional outbreak of the pandemic will continue to occur action to contain the pandemic spread or treat it impact timing of the availability of vaccine and their distribution acceptance and efficacy and governmental business and individual personal action taken in response to the pandemic including restriction and limitation on travel and transportation and change in leisure and business travel pattern and work environment among others some of these action and related impact may be trend that continue in the future even after the pandemic no longer pose significant public health risk we considered the deterioration in general economic and market condition primarily due to the covid pandemic to be triggering event in the first and second quarter of requiring an impairment evaluation of goodwill intangible asset and other asset in our commercial aerospace business collins aerospace and pratt whitney beginning in the second quarter of we observed several airline customer bankruptcy delay and cancellation of aircraft purchase by airline fleet retirement and repositioning of oem production schedule and we experienced significant decline in revenue at our collins aerospace and pratt whitney business due to decline in flight hour aircraft fleet utilization shop visit and commercial oem delivery these factor contributed to deterioration of our expectation regarding the timing of return to pre covid commercial flight activity which further reduced our future sale and cash flow expectation based on our updated forecast assumption in the second quarter of we concluded that the carrying value of two of our collins aerospace reporting unit were greater than their respective fair value and accordingly recorded goodwill impairment charge of billion we did not identify any further deterioration to our expectation in the third quarter of and therefore did not have triggering event we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing of october and determined that no additional adjustment to the carrying value of our goodwill were necessary refer to note acquisition disposition goodwill and intangible asset for additional information additionally in we recorded write down of non goodwill asset and significant unfavorable estimate at completion eac adjustment in our collins aerospace and pratt whitney business primarily related to increased estimated credit loss on both our receivables and contract asset of million an unfavorable eac adjustment on pratt whitney commercial engine aftermarket contract due to lower estimated revenue driven by change in the estimated maintenance coverage period of million contract asset and inventory impairment at collins aerospace due to the impact of lower estimated future customer activity resulting from the expected acceleration of fleet retirement of commercial aircraft of million an unfavorable eac adjustment of million related to lower estimated revenue due to the restructuring of customer contract at pratt whitney an million impairment of commercial aircraft program asset at pratt whitney the impairment of collins aerospace trade name of million of content net unfavorable eac adjustment on commercial aftermarket contract at pratt whitney based on change in estimated future customer activity of million an unfavorable eac adjustment at pratt whitney related to shift in overhead cost to military contract of million and reserve related to commercial financing arrangement at pratt whitney of million described further in note commercial aerospace industry asset and commitment we have significant exposure related to our airline and airframer customer including significant account receivable and contract asset balance given the uncertainty related to the severity and length of the pandemic well any worsening of the pandemic mutation to the strain of the virus and the timing and impact of vaccine and whether there will be additional outbreak of the pandemic and it impact across the aerospace industry we may be required to record additional charge or impairment in future period although the impact of covid on our commercial business is significant we currently believe we have sufficient liquidity to withstand the current estimated impact summary of accounting principle result of the raytheon merger and the separation transaction several of our accounting policy have been modified and certain additional police have been added the following represents the significant accounting principle of raytheon technology corporation consolidation and classification the consolidated financial statement include the account of raytheon technology corporation and all wholly owned majority owned and otherwise controlled domestic and foreign subsidiary all intercompany transaction have been eliminated for classification of certain current asset and liability the duration of our contract or program is utilized to define our operating cycle which is generally longer than one year included within our current asset and liability are contract asset and liability related to our aftermarket and development arrangement which can generally span up to fifteen year result of the separation transaction the distribution and the raytheon merger certain reclassification have been made to the prior year amount to conform to the current year presentation these reclassification include the presentation of current asset and liability based upon the duration of our operating cycle the reclassification of certain unbilled account receivable from account receivable net to contract asset reclassification of lease amortization within our presentation of cash flow reclassification within our segment presentation and the reclassification of the historical carrier and otis result to discontinued operation use of estimate our consolidated financial statement are based on the application of generally accepted accounting principle gaap which require to make estimate and assumption about future event that affect the amount reported in our consolidated financial statement and the accompanying note discussed above the full extent to which the covid pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business result of operation financial condition and cash flow including sale expense reserve and allowance asset recoverability and eac adjustment will depend on future development that are highly uncertain including new information that may emerge concerning covid and related containment and treatment action well the economic impact on local regional national and international customer and market we have made estimate of the impact of covid within our financial statement and there may be change to those estimate in future period other future event including covid and their effect can not be determined with certainty therefore the determination of estimate requires the exercise of judgment actual result could differ from those estimate and any such difference may be material to our consolidated financial statement cash and cash equivalent cash and cash equivalent includes cash on hand demand deposit and short term cash investment that are highly liquid in nature and have original maturity of three month or le the estimated fair value of cash and cash equivalent approximates the carrying value due to their short maturity on occasion we are required to maintain cash deposit with certain bank with respect to contractual obligation related to acquisition or divestiture or other legal obligation of december and the amount of such restricted cash wa approximately million and million respectively this restricted cash is excluded from cash and cash equivalent and is included in other asset current and other asset on our consolidated balance sheet account receivable account receivable are stated at the net amount expected to be collected the allowance for credit loss is established to provide for the expected lifetime credit loss by evaluating factor such customer creditworthiness historical payment and loss experience current economic condition and the age and status of outstanding receivables see the accounting pronouncement section below for additional information to how we develop our allowance for credit loss under accounting standard update asu financial instrument credit loss topic measurement of credit loss on financial instrument of contentsunbilled receivables represent revenue that are not currently billable to the customer under the term of the contract and include unbilled amount under commercial contract where payment is solely subject to the passage of time these item are expected to be billed and collected in the normal course of business account receivable of december and includes unbilled receivables of million and million respectively which primarily includes unbilled receivables with commercial aerospace customer other unbilled receivables not subject to the passage of time are included in contract asset in the consolidated balance sheet and are generally classified current contract asset and liability contract asset and liability represent the difference in the timing of revenue recognition from receipt of cash from our customer contract asset reflect revenue recognized and performance obligation satisfied or partially satisfied in advance of customer billing contract liability relate to payment received in advance of the satisfaction of performance under the contract we receive payment from customer based on the term established in our contract contract asset and contract liability are generally classified current our operating cycle is generally longer than one year see note contract asset and liability for further discussion of contract asset and liability inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value and is primarily based on first in first out fifo or average cost method valuation reserve for excess obsolete and slow moving inventory are estimated by comparing the inventory level of individual part to both future sale forecast or production requirement and historical usage rate in order to identify inventory where the resale value or replacement value is le than inventoriable cost other factor that management considers in determining the adequacy of these reserve include whether individual inventory part meet current specification and can be substituted for part currently being sold or used service part overall market condition and other inventory management initiative manufacturing cost are allocated to current production contract in our commercial aerospace business excess cost beyond standard manufacturing cost are expensed when they meet certain threshold equity method investment investment in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence but do not control are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are included in other asset on the consolidated balance sheet under this method of accounting our share of the net earnings or loss of the investee is included in other income net on the consolidated statement of operation since the activity of the investee are closely aligned with the operation of the business segment holding the investment we evaluate our equity method investment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of such investment may be impaired if decline in the value of an equity method investment is determined to be other than temporary loss is recorded in earnings in the current period rtc sell product to and purchase product and service from unconsolidated entity accounted for under the equity method which are considered related party this activity is not considered material to the consolidated statement of operation consolidated balance sheet of rtc customer financing asset customer financing asset cfa relate to our commercial aerospace business in which we provide financing to airline customer our financing predominately relates to product under lease and to lesser extent note and lease receivables in certain limited circumstance we pay deposit on behalf of our airline customer to secure production slot with the airframers and such pre delivery payment are included in our note receivables any unfunded pre delivery payment are included within our commercial aerospace financing commitment further discussed in note commitment and contingency we record revenue from lease asset by applying financial accounting standard board fasb accounting standard codification asc topic lease and from interest income on the note and lease receivables interest income from note and financing lease and rental income from operating lease asset is generally included in other income net in the consolidated statement of operation while gain or loss on sale of operating lease asset are included in product sale and cost of sale the current portion of these financing arrangement are aggregated in other asset current and the non current portion of these financing arrangement are aggregated in cfa in the consolidated balance sheet the increase and decrease in cfa from funding receipt and certain other activity are generally reflected investing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flow leased asset are valued at cost and reviewed for impairment when circumstance indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable note and lease receivables are valued at the net amount expected to be collected for note and lease receivables we determine specific reserve for exposure based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated fair value of the related collateral in connection with the evaluation of credit risk and collectability of december and the reserve related to cfa were not material at december and we did not have any significant balance that are considered to be delinquent on non accrual status past due day or more or considered to be impaired of contentsbusiness combination once business is acquired the fair value of the identifiable asset acquired and liability assumed is determined with the excess cost recorded to goodwill required preliminary fair value is determined once business is acquired with the final determination of the fair value being completed no later than one year from the date of acquisition in connection with the acquisition of rockwell collins in and goodrich in and to lesser extent the acquisition of raytheon company in we recorded assumed liability related to customer contractual obligation on certain contract with economic return that were lower than what could be realized in market transaction of the acquisition date we measured these assumed liability based on the estimated cash flow of the program plus reasonable contracting profit margin required to transfer the contract to market participant these liability are being amortized in accordance with the underlying pattern of obligation reflected by the expense incurred on the contract the balance of the contractual obligation wa million and million at december and respectively total consumption of the contractual obligation for the year ended december and wa million million and million respectively with future consumption expected to be follows million in million in million in million in million in and million thereafter goodwill and intangible asset goodwill represents cost in excess of fair value assigned to the underlying net asset of acquired business goodwill and intangible asset deemed to have indefinite life are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing annually or more frequently if event or change in circumstance indicate the asset might be impaired the goodwill impairment test compare carrying value of the reporting unit to their estimated fair value if the carrying value exceeds the fair value then the carrying value is reduced to fair value in developing our estimate for the fair value of our reporting unit and unamortized intangible asset significant judgment is required in the determination of the appropriateness of using qualitative assessment or quantitative assessment for the quantitative assessment that are performed fair value is primarily based on income approach using discounted cash flow method or relief from royalty method which have significant assumption including sale growth rate projected operating profit terminal growth rate discount rate and royalty rate such assumption are subject to variability from year to year and are directly impacted by among other thing global market condition finite lived intangible asset are tested for impairment when event occur that indicate that the net book value will not be recovered over future cash flow intangible asset consist of patent trademark tradenames customer relationship exclusivity asset developed technology and other intangible asset including collaboration asset acquired intangible asset are recognized at fair value in purchase accounting finite lived intangible asset are amortized to cost of sale and selling general and administrative expense over the applicable useful life exclusivity asset are commercial aerospace payment made to secure certain contractual right to provide product on new aircraft platform we classify amortization of such payment reduction of sale such payment are capitalized when there are distinct right obtained and there are sufficient incremental cash flow to support the recoverability of the asset established otherwise the applicable portion of the payment are expensed in addition in connection with our agreement to acquire roll royce ownership and collaboration interest in international aero engine ag iae additional payment are due to roll royce contingent upon each hour flown through june by the powered aircraft in service of the acquisition date these flight hour payment are being capitalized collaboration asset and amortized to cost of sale useful life of finite lived intangible asset are estimated based upon the nature of the intangible asset and the industry in which the intangible asset is used these intangible asset are amortized based on the pattern in which the economic benefit of the intangible asset are consumed represented by the underlying cash flow which may result in an amortization method other than straight line for both our commercial aerospace collaboration asset and exclusivity arrangement the pattern of economic benefit generally result in no amortization during the development period with amortization beginning program enter full rate production and aftermarket cycle if pattern of economic benefit can not be reliably determined or if straight line amortization approximates the pattern of economic benefit straight line amortization method may be used the range of estimated useful life is follows yearscollaboration relationship and related to to and to to we account for lease in accordance with asc topic lease which we adopted on january lessee we record right of use asset and lease liability on the consolidated balance sheet for all lease with term longer than of contentsmonths lease are classified either finance or operating with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the consolidated statement of operation we enter into lease agreement for the use of real estate space vehicle information technology equipment and certain other equipment under both operating and finance lease we determine if an arrangement contains lease at inception operating lease are included in operating lease right of use asset accrued liability for the current portion of our operating lease liability and operating lease liability in our consolidated balance sheet finance lease are not considered significant to our consolidated balance sheet or consolidated statement of operation right of use asset represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liability represent our obligation to make lease payment arising from the lease lease right of use asset and liability are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payment over the lease term most of our lease do not provide an implicit rate we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payment and use the implicit rate when readily determinable we determine our incremental borrowing rate through market source including relevant industry rate our lease right of use asset also include any initial direct cost and lease pre payment made at or before the commencement date and are reduced for any lease incentive received at or before the commencement date certain of our lease include variable payment which may vary based upon change in fact or circumstance after the start of the lease we exclude variable payment from lease right of use asset and lease liability to the extent not considered fixed and instead expense variable payment incurred variable lease expense and lease expense for short duration contract are not material component of lease expense some of our lease include the option to extend or terminate the lease we include these option in the recognition of our right of use asset and lease liability when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option lease expense is generally recognized on straight line basis over the lease term in limited instance we act lessor primarily for commercial aerospace engine the majority of which are classified operating lease these lease are not significant to our consolidated balance sheet or consolidated statement of operation other long lived asset we evaluate the potential impairment of other long lived asset whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable if the carrying value of other long lived asset held and used exceeds the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flow the carrying value is written down to fair value in order for long lived asset to be considered held for disposal we must have committed to plan to dispose of the asset once deemed held for disposal the asset are stated at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value income tax future income tax represent the tax effect of transaction which are reported in different period for tax and financial reporting purpose these amount consist of the tax effect of temporary difference between the tax and financial reporting balance sheet and tax carryforwards future income tax benefit and payable within the tax paying component of particular jurisdiction are offset for presentation in the consolidated balance sheet in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax position we ass our income tax position and record tax benefit for all year subject to examination based upon management evaluation of the fact circumstance and information available at the reporting date for those tax position where it is more likely than not that tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with taxing authority that ha full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax position where it is not more likely than not that tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit ha been recognized in the financial statement where applicable associated interest expense ha also been recognized we recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefit in interest expense penalty if incurred would be recognized component of income tax expense state income tax amount are generally included in income tax expense however state income tax payment related to our raytheon intelligence space ri and raytheon missile defense rmd segment are generally recoverable through the pricing of product and service to the government accordingly these state income tax are generally allocated to contract and reclassified to selling general and administrative expense when paid recovered or otherwise agreed allocable with the government we have elected to account for tax on global intangible low taxed income gilti period cost incurred revenue recognition the vast majority of our revenue are from long term contract associated with the design development manufacture or modification of complex aerospace or defense equipment or related service collins aerospace and pratt whitney primarily serve commercial and government customer in both the oem and aftermarket part and service market of the aerospace industry while ri and rmd primarily provide product and service to government customer in the defense industry we account for contract when it ha approval and commitment from both party the right of the party are identified payment term are identified the contract ha commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable for certain contract that meet the foregoing requirement primarily contract that are directly with foreign government we are required of contentsto obtain certain regulatory approval in these case we recognize revenue based on the likelihood of obtaining regulatory approval based upon all known fact and circumstance performance obligation is promise in contract with customer to transfer distinct good or service to the customer some of our contract with customer contain single performance obligation while others contain multiple performance obligation most commonly when contract contains multiple distinct unit such engine or certain aerospace component or span multiple phase of the product life cycle such production maintenance and support contract transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized revenue when or the performance obligation is satisfied when there are multiple performance obligation within contract we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on it standalone selling price when available if standalone selling price is not available we estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation which is generally based on an expected cost plus margin approach we consider the contractual consideration payable by the customer and ass variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price including contractual discount contract incentive payment estimate of award fee flight hour aircraft landing or other customer usage activity on long term maintenance contract and other source of variable consideration when determining the transaction price of each contract when reasonably able to estimate we include variable consideration in the transaction price at the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled we include estimated amount in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved these estimate are based on historical experience anticipated performance and our best judgment at the time we also consider whether our contract contain significant financing component which they generally do not timing of the satisfaction of performance obligation varies across our business due to our diverse product and service mix customer base and contractual term performance obligation are satisfied of point in time for certain aerospace component engine and spare part revenue is recognized when control of the product transfer to the customer generally upon product shipment since billing also typically occurs upon product shipment we generally do not have contract asset or contract liability balance related to point in time sale performance obligation are satisfied over time if the customer receives the benefit we perform work if the customer control the asset it is being produced continuous transfer of control or if the product being produced for the customer ha no alternative use and we have contractual right to payment for performance to date we recognize revenue on an over time basis for substantially all defense contract and certain long term aerospace oem and aftermarket contract substantially all of our defense business revenue which primarily relates to our ri and rmd segment and to lesser extent pratt whitney and collins aerospace is recognized over time because of the continuous transfer of control to our customer for performance obligation satisfied over time revenue is recognized on percentage of completion basis using cost incurred to date relative to total estimated cost at completion to measure progress incurred cost represent work performed which correspond with and best depict transfer of control to the customer contract cost can include labor material subcontractor cost or other direct cost and indirect cost our contract with the government are typically subject to the federal acquisition regulation far and are priced based on estimated or actual cost of producing good or providing service the far provides guidance on the type of cost that are allowable in establishing price for good and service provided under government contract the pricing for non government contract is based on the specific negotiation with each customer under the typical payment term of our government fixed price contract the customer pay either performance based payment pbps or progress payment pbps are interim payment equal to negotiated percentage of the contract price based on quantifiable measure of performance or on the achievement of specified event or milestone progress payment are interim payment up to of cost incurred the work progress because the customer retains portion of the contract price until completion of the contract our government fixed price contract generally result in revenue recognized in excess of billing which we present contract asset on the consolidated balance sheet for our government cost type contract the customer generally pay for our cost incurred within short period of time for non government contract we typically receive interim payment work progress although for some contract we may be entitled to receive an advance payment such advance are not considered significant financing component because they are used to meet working capital demand that can be higher in the early stage of contract and to protect from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of it obligation under the contract we recognize liability for advance payment in excess of revenue recognized and present it contract liability on the consolidated balance sheet for certain of our long term aftermarket contract revenue is recognized over the contract period we generally account for such contract series of daily performance obligation to stand ready to provide spare part product maintenance and aftermarket service these arrangement include the sale of spare part with integral service to our customer and are generally classified service sale with the corresponding cost classified in cost of service sold within the consolidated of contentsstatement of operation revenue is primarily recognized on percentage of completion basis using cost incurred to date relative to total estimated cost at completion to measure progress sufficient historical evidence indicates that the cost of performing service under the contract is incurred on an other than straight line basis for some of our long term aftermarket contract we receive payment prior to delivery of product and service resulting in contract liability balance while for others we deliver product or service in advance of payment resulting in contract asset balance contract are often modified to account for change in contract specification or requirement we consider contract modification to exist when the modification either creates new or change existing enforceable right and obligation contract modification for good or service that are not distinct are accounted for part of the existing contract either on cumulative catch up basis or prospective basis depending on the nature of the modification loss provision on contract are recognized to the extent that estimated contract cost exceed the estimated consideration from the product or service contemplated under the contractual arrangement for new commitment we generally record loss provision at contract signing except for certain contract under which loss are recorded upon receipt of the purchase order that obligates to perform for existing commitment anticipated loss on contractual arrangement are recognized in the period in which loss become evident in estimating loss product contemplated under contractual arrangement include firm quantity of product sold under contract and in the commercial engine and wheel and brake business future highly probable sale of replacement part required by regulation that are expected to be sold subsequently for incorporation into the original equipment in our commercial engine and wheel and brake business when the oem product is sold for loss but the combined oem and aftermarket arrangement for each individual sale campaign is profitable we record oem product loss at the time of product delivery we review our estimate at completion eacs on significant contract on periodic basis and for others no le than annually or when change in circumstance warrant modification to previous estimate due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the company performance obligation the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex subject to many variable and requires significant judgment by management on contract by contract basis part of this process management review information including but not limited to any outstanding key contract matter progress towards completion and the related program schedule identified risk and opportunity and the related change in estimate of revenue and cost the risk and opportunity relate to management judgment about the ability and cost to achieve the schedule consideration of customer directed delay or reduction in scheduled delivery technical requirement customer activity level such flight hour or aircraft landing and related variable consideration management judgment related to these consideration ha become increasingly more significant given the current economic environment primarily caused by the covid pandemic management must make assumption and estimate regarding contract revenue and cost including estimate of labor productivity and availability the complexity and scope of the work to be performed the availability and cost of material the length of time to complete the performance obligation execution by our subcontractor the availability and timing of funding from our customer overhead cost rate and current and past maintenance cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful life of component among others cost estimate may also include the estimated cost of satisfying our industrial cooperation agreement sometimes in the form of either offset obligation or in country industrial participation icip agreement required under certain contract primarily within our ri and rmd segment these obligation may or may not be distinct depending on their nature if cash is paid to customer to satisfy our offset obligation it is recorded reduction in the transaction price change in estimate of net sale cost of sale and the related impact to operating profit on contract recognized over time are recognized on cumulative catch up basis which recognizes the cumulative effect of the profit change on current and prior period based on performance obligation percentage of completion in the current period significant change in one or more of these estimate could affect the profitability of one or more of our performance obligation our eac adjustment also include the establishment of loss provision for our contract accounted for on percentage of completion basis net eac adjustment had the following impact on our operating result dollar in million except per share amount profit loss income loss from continuing operation attributable to common shareowner diluted earnings loss per share from continuing operation attributable to common shareowner amount reflect statutory tax rate of which approximates our tax rate on our eac adjustment for additional discussion on significant unfavorable eac adjustment see the covid pandemic discussion above in and revenue wa reduced by net of million million and increased by million respectively for of contentsperformance obligation satisfied or partially satisfied in previous period this primarily relates to eac adjustment that impacted revenue result of the raytheon merger raytheon company contract accounted for on percentage of completion basis were reset to zero percent complete of the date of completion of the raytheon merger since only the unperformed portion of the contract at such date represents an obligation of the company this will have the impact of reducing gross favorable and unfavorable eac adjustment for these segment in the short term with the exception of eac adjustment related to loss contract for additional information related to the raytheon merger see note acquisition disposition goodwill and intangible asset in our collins aerospace and pratt whitney business we incur contract fulfillment cost for engineering and development of aerospace oem product directly related to existing or anticipated contract with customer such cost generate or enhance our ability to satisfy our performance obligation under these contract we capitalize these cost contract fulfillment cost to the extent the cost are recoverable from the associated contract margin and customer funding and subsequently amortize the cost the related performance obligation are satisfied in instance where intellectual property doe not transfer to the customer we generally defer the customer funding of product engineering and development and recognize revenue when the related performance obligation are satisfied capitalized contract fulfillment cost were million and million of december and respectively and are classified in other asset in our consolidated balance sheet and are included in other operating activity net in our consolidated statement of cash flow we regularly ass capitalized contract fulfillment cost for impairment we had million of impairment for contract fulfillment cost in and had no impairment in or cost to obtain contract are not material in view of the risk and cost associated with developing new engine and the large up front investment required that often require return generated over the full estimated life of the engine pratt whitney ha entered into certain collaboration arrangement in which sale cost and risk are shared sale generated from engine program spare part sale and aftermarket business under these collaboration arrangement are recorded consistent with our revenue recognition policy in our consolidated financial statement amount attributable to our collaborator for their share of sale are recorded cost of sale in our consolidated financial statement based upon the term and nature of the arrangement cost associated with engine program under collaborative arrangement are expensed incurred under these arrangement collaborator contribute their program share of engine part incur their own production cost and make certain payment for shared or joint program cost the reimbursement from collaborator of their share of program cost is recorded reduction of the related expense item at that time of december the collaborator interest in all commercial engine program ranged from to inclusive of portion of pratt whitney interest held by other participant pratt whitney is the principal participant in all existing collaborative arrangement with the exception of the engine alliance ea joint venture with ge aviation which market and manufacture the engine for the airbus aircraft there are no individually significant collaborative arrangement and none of the collaborator individually have more than share in an individual program the following table illustrates the consolidated

and reported cost of sale on the related revenue generating contract foreign exchange we conduct business in many different currency and accordingly are subject to the inherent risk associated with foreign exchange rate movement the financial position and result of operation of many of our foreign subsidiary are often measured using the local currency the functional currency foreign currency denominated asset and liability are translated into dollar at the exchange rate existing at the respective balance sheet date and income and expense item are translated at the average exchange rate during the respective period the aggregate effect of translating the balance sheet of these subsidiary are deferred separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss aocl in shareowner equity derivative and hedging activity we use derivative instrument including swap forward contract and option to help manage certain foreign currency and from time to time to help manage interest rate and commodity price exposure derivative instrument are viewed risk management tool by and are not used for trading or speculative purpose by their nature all financial instrument involve market and credit risk we enter into derivative and other financial instrument with major investment grade financial institution and have policy to monitor the credit risk of those counterparties we limit counterparty exposure and concentration of risk by diversifying counterparties while there can be no assurance we do not anticipate any material non performance by any of these counterparties we enter into transaction that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement with various counterparties however we have not elected to offset multiple contract with single counterparty

liability ha been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated the most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available fact with respect to each individual site including existing technology current law and regulation and prior remediation experience where no amount within range of estimate is more likely the minimum is accrued for site with multiple responsible party we consider our likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation cost and the ability of the other party to fulfill their obligation in establishing provision for those cost liability with fixed or reliably determinable future cash payment are discounted portion of these cost is eligible for future recovery through the pricing of our product and service to the government we regularly ass the probability of recovery of these cost which requires to make assumption about the extent of cost recovery under our contract and the amount of future contract activity with the government we consider such recovery probable based on government contracting regulation and our history of receiving reimbursement for such cost and accordingly have recorded the future recovery of these cost from the government within other asset in the consolidated balance sheet accrued environmental liability are not reduced by potential insurance reimbursement or potential recovery from pursuing other party see note commitment and contingency for additional detail on the environmental remediation activity pension and postretirement obligation gaap requires balance sheet recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and postretirement benefit prb plan funded status is measured at least annually in the fourth quarter and represents the difference between the plan projected benefit obligation pbo and the fair market value of the plan asset of contentschanges to our pension and prb plan funded status can result from company action such contribution or change in

expected return on plan asset eroa these gain or loss are recorded in other comprehensive income net of tax effect until they are amortized component of net periodic benefit income expense calculated market related value of our plan asset is used to develop the amount of deferred asset gain or loss to be amortized the market related value of asset is equal to the fair value of asset adjusted to reflect the recognition and subsequent amortization of the difference between actual and expected asset return over five year period the market related value of asset is used to calculate the expected return on asset included in the net periodic benefit income expense the company ha elected to use the corridor approach in the amortization of gain and loss which limit the expense recognition to the net outstanding gain and loss in excess of the greater of of the pbo or of the market related value of asset gain and loss exceeding the corridor are amortized in net periodic benefit income expense over either the projected average remaining employee service period or the projected average remaining lifetime of inactive participant depending on the plan net periodic benefit income expense is split between operating profit and non operating income whereby only the service cost component is included in operating profit and the remaining component are included in non service pension income expense product performance obligation we extend performance and operating cost guarantee beyond our normal service and warranty policy for extended period on some of our product particularly commercial aircraft engine liability under such guarantee is based upon future product performance and durability we accrue for such cost that are probable and can be reasonably estimated in addition we incur discretionary cost to service our product in connection with product performance issue the cost associated with these product performance and operating cost guarantee require estimate over the full term of the agreement and require management to consider factor such the extent of future maintenance requirement interval between flight and repair time and the future cost of material and labor to perform the service these cost estimate are largely based upon historical experience see note guarantee for further discussion accounting pronouncement in june the fasb issued asu financial instrument credit loss topic measurement of credit loss on financial instrument this asu and it related amendment collectively the credit loss standard modifies the impairment model to utilize an expected loss methodology in place of the incurred loss methodology for financial instrument including trade receivables contract asset and off balance sheet credit exposure the credit loss standard requires consideration of broader range of information to estimate expected credit loss including historical information current economic condition and reasonable forecast period this asu requires that the statement of operation reflect estimate of expected credit loss for newly recognized financial asset well change in the estimate of expected credit loss that have taken place during the period which may result in earlier recognition of certain loss we adopted this standard effective january utilizing modified retrospective approach cumulative effect non cash adjustment to retained earnings of january wa recorded in the amount of million the adoption of this standard did not have material impact on the company consolidated financial statement we are exposed to credit loss primarily through our sale of product and service to commercial customer which are recorded trade receivables contract asset long term receivables and note and lease receivables on the consolidated balance sheet we do not have any significant exposure for credit loss related to sale of product and service to our government customer our method for developing our allowance for credit loss involves making informed judgment regarding whether an adjustment is necessary to our historical loss experience to reflect our expectation around current economic condition and reasonable and supportable forecast period where applicable we utilize current economic market data well other internal and external information available to to inform our decision making in certain circumstance we may be able to develop reasonable and supportable forecast over the contractual term of the financial asset or off balance sheet exposure for period beyond which we are able to make or obtain reasonable and supportable forecast we revert to historical loss experience and information we determine credit rating for each customer in our portfolio based upon public information and information obtained directly from our customer we conduct review of customer credit rating published historical credit default rate for different rating category and multiple third party aircraft value publication basis to validate the reasonableness of the allowance for credit loss on these balance quarterly or when event and circumstance warrant in addition to credit quality indicator factor considered in our evaluation of assessing collectability and risk include underlying value of any collateral or security interest significant past due balance historical loss and existing economic condition including geographic and political risk credit limit is established for each customer based on the outcome of this review customer credit rating range from of contentscustomers with an extremely strong capacity to meet financial obligation to customer whose uncollateralized receivable is in default we may require collateral or prepayment to mitigate credit risk to estimate expected credit loss of financial asset with similar risk characteristic we determine an asset is impaired when based on historical experience current information and reasonable forecast period there is risk that we will be unable to collect amount due according to the contractual term of the agreement we monitor our ongoing credit exposure through review of customer balance against contract term and due date current economic condition and dispute resolution estimated credit loss are written off in the period in which the financial asset is no longer collectible we can also be exposed to credit loss from off balance sheet exposure such certain financial guarantee and financing commitment we have assessed these potential exposure and concluded that there are no material associated credit loss of december in december the

event in the first and second quarter of requiring an impairment evaluation of goodwill intangible asset and other asset in our commercial aerospace business collins aerospace and pratt whitney beginning in the second quarter of we observed several airline customer bankruptcy delay and cancellation of aircraft purchase by airline fleet retirement and repositioning of oem production schedule and we experienced significant decline in revenue at our collins aerospace and pratt whitney business due to decline in flight hour aircraft fleet utilization shop visit and commercial oem delivery these factor contributed to deterioration of our expectation regarding the timing of return to pre covid commercial flight activity which further reduced our future sale and cash flow expectation in the second quarter of we evaluated the collins aerospace and pratt whitney reporting unit for goodwill impairment and determined that the carrying value of two of the six collins aerospace reporting unit exceeded the sum of discounted future cash flow resulting in goodwill impairment of billion collins aerospace discounted future cash flow estimate were developed for three scenario base case downside case and an upside case these scenario included assumption regarding future airline flight activity out of warranty hour on original equipment expected repair upgrade and replacement future oem manufacturing schedule and related environmental assumption including individual desire to return to normal travel business need to travel and potential cure or vaccine to prevent or reduce the effect of covid these estimate require significant amount of judgment and are subject to change based upon factor outside our control we weighted the three scenario follows for the base case for the downside case and for the upside case and used these weighting we believed they reflected the risk and opportunity relative to our estimate goodwill impairment wa not indicated for any of the other reporting unit evaluated for impairment in any of these scenario we did not identify any further deterioration to our expectation in the third quarter of and therefore did not have triggering event of contentson october we changed our annual goodwill impairment testing date from july to october to better align with the timing of our annual long term planning process accordingly management determined that the change in accounting principle is preferable under the circumstance this change ha been applied prospectively from october retrospective application would not change the company accounting for goodwill this change wa not material to our consolidated financial statement it did not delay accelerate or avoid any potential goodwill impairment charge we completed our annual impairment testing of october where we assessed our pratt whitney ri rmd and one of the collins aerospace reporting unit using qualitative factor to determine whether it wa more likely than not that any individual reporting unit fair value is le than it carrying value step and determined that no further testing wa required based on there being no significant change at ri and rmd since the acquisition of raytheon company and the substantial cushion of fair value over book value at the other reporting unit for the remainder of our collins aerospace reporting unit we compared the fair value of the reporting unit to their respective carrying value step and determined that no additional adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill were necessary based on our annual impairment analysis of october the reporting unit that wa closest to impairment wa reporting unit at collins aerospace with fair value in excess of book value including goodwill of billion or impairment evaluation at collins aerospace and pratt whitney resulted in several other non goodwill related impairment charge further discussed in note basis of presentation and summary of accounting principle these charge were primarily due to decline in expected future commercial air traffic airline bankruptcy or other impact such accelerated fleet retirement announced program delay and expected change to contract term the company continuously monitor for event and circumstance that could negatively impact the key assumption in determining the fair value of goodwill including long term revenue growth projection profitability discount rate recent market valuation from transaction by comparable company volatility in the company market capitalization and general industry market and macro economic condition it is possible that future change in such circumstance including more prolonged and or severe covid pandemic than originally anticipated or future change in the variable associated with the

other financing source we may also arrange for third party investor to assume portion of these commitment the majority of financing commitment are collateralized arrangement we may also lease aircraft and subsequently sublease the aircraft to customer under long term non cancelable operating lease our financing commitment with customer are contingent upon maintenance of certain level of financial condition by the customer associated risk on these commitment are mitigated due to the fact that interest rate are variable during the commitment term and are set at the date of funding based on current market condition the fair value of the underlying collateral and the credit worthiness of the customer result the fair value of these financing commitment is expected to equal the amount funded we also have other contractual commitment including commitment to make payment to secure certain contractual right to provide product on new aircraft platform which are included in other

agreement both agreed to and anticipated to be agreed to had an outstanding notional value of approximately billion these agreement are designed to return economic value to the foreign country by requiring to engage in activity supporting local defense or commercial industry promoting balance of trade developing in country technology capability or addressing other local development priority offset agreement may be satisfied through activity that do not require direct cash payment including transferring technology providing manufacturing training and other consulting support to in country project and the purchase by third party our vendor of supply from in country vendor these agreement may also be satisfied through our use of cash for activity such subcontracting with local partner purchasing supply from in country vendor providing financial support for in country of contentsprojects and making investment in local venture such activity may also vary by country depending upon requirement dictated by their government we typically do not commit to offset agreement until order for our product or service are definitive the amount ultimately applied against our offset agreement are based on negotiation with the customer and typically require cash outlay that represent only fraction of the notional value in the offset agreement offset program usually extend over several or more year and may provide for penalty in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirement historically we have not been required to pay any penalty of significance government oversight in the ordinary course of business the company and it subsidiary and our property are subject to regulatory and governmental examination information gathering request inquiry investigation and threatened legal action and proceeding for example we are now and believe that in light of the current government contracting environment we will continue to be the subject of one or more government investigation our contract with the government are also subject to audit agency that oversee contract performance include the defense contract audit agency dcaa the defense contract management agency dcma the inspector general of the department of defense dod and other department and agency the government accountability office gao the department of justice doj and congressional committee other area of our business operation may also be subject to audit and investigation by these and other agency from time to time agency investigate or conduct audit to determine whether our

investigation and audit could result in administrative civil or criminal liability including repayment fine treble or other damage forfeiture restitution or penalty being imposed upon the suspension of government export license or the suspension or debarment from future government contracting government investigation often take year to complete the government also reserve the right to debar contractor from receiving new government contract for fraudulent criminal or other seriously improper conduct the government could void any contract found to be tainted by fraud like many defense contractor we have received audit report recommending the reduction of certain contract price because for example cost or pricing data or cost accounting practice used to price and negotiate those contract may not have conformed to government regulation some of these audit report recommend that certain payment be repaid delayed or withheld and may involve substantial amount we have made voluntary refund in those case we believe appropriate have settled some allegation and in some case continue to negotiate and or litigate the company may be and ha been required to make payment into escrow of disputed liability while the related litigation is pending if the litigation is resolved in the company favor any such payment will be returned to the company with interest our final allowable incurred cost for each year are also subject to audit and have from time to time resulted in dispute between and the government with litigation resulting at the court of federal claim cofc or the armed service board of contract appeal asbca or their related court of appeal in addition the doj ha from time to time convened grand jury to investigate possible irregularity by we also provide product and service to customer outside of the and those sale are subject to local government law regulation and procurement policy and practice our compliance with such local government regulation or any applicable government regulation the foreign corrupt practice act fcpa and international traffic in arm regulation itar may also be investigated or audited in addition we accrue for liability associated with those matter that are probable and can be reasonably estimated the most likely liability amount to be incurred is accrued based upon range of estimate where no amount within range of estimate is more likely then we accrue the minimum amount other than specifically disclosed in this form we do not expect these audit investigation or dispute to have material effect on our financial position result of operation or liquidity either individually or in the aggregate legal proceeding the company and it subsidiary are subject to various litigation matter across jurisdiction

pratt whitney appealed to the asbca in january thales raytheon system matteras previously disclosed in raytheon company received subpoena from the security and exchange commission sec seeking

former raytheon company board of director the company and certain of it executive each alleging that defendant violated federal security law and breached their fiduciary duty by engaging in improper accounting practice failing to implement sufficient internal financial and compliance control and making series of false and misleading statement in regulatory filing we believe that each of these lawsuit lack merit darnis et al on august several former employee of utc or it subsidiary filed putative class action complaint in the united state district court for the district of connecticut against the company otis carrier the former member of the utc board of director and the member of the carrier and otis board of director geraud darnis et al raytheon technology corporation et al the

which could result from this action other described in note guarantee we extend performance and operating cost guarantee beyond our normal warranty and service policy for extended period on some of our product we have accrued our estimate of the liability that may result under these guarantee and for service cost that are probable and can be reasonably estimated we also have other commitment and contingent liability related to legal proceeding self insurance program and matter arising out of the normal course of business we accrue contingency based upon range of possible outcome if no amount within this range is better estimate than any other then we accrue the minimum amount of note the design development production and support of new aerospace technology is inherently complex and subject to risk since the geared turbofan engine entered into service in technical issue have been identified and experienced with the engine which is usual for new engine and new aerospace technology pratt whitney ha addressed these issue through various improvement and modification these issue have resulted in financial impact including increased warranty provision customer contract settlement and reduction in contract performance estimate additional technical issue either related to this program or other program may also arise in the normal course which may result in financial impact that could be material to the company financial position result of operation and cash flow of contentsin the ordinary course of business the company and it subsidiary are also routinely defendant in party
