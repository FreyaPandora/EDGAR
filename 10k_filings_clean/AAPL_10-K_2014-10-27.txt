intended to represent actual loss but is used risk estimation and management tool the model assumes normal market condition forecasted transaction firm commitment and asset and liability denominated in foreign currency were excluded from the model based on the result of the model the company estimate with confidence maximum one day loss in fair value of million of september compared to maximum one day loss in fair value of million of september because the company us foreign currency instrument for hedging purpose the loss in fair value incurred on those instrument are generally offset by increase in the fair value of the underlying exposure actual future gain and loss associated with the company investment portfolio and derivative position may differ materially from the sensitivity
