aggressive price cutting and resulting downward pressure on gross margin frequent introduction of new product short product life cycle evolving industry standard continual improvement in product price performance characteristic rapid adoption of technological and product advancement by competitor and price sensitivity on the part of consumer the company ability to compete successfully depends heavily on it ability to ensure continuing and timely introduction of innovative new product and technology to the marketplace the company belief it is unique in that it design and develops nearly the entire solution for it product including the hardware operating system numerous software application and related service result the company must make significant investment in research and development and currently hold significant number of patent and copyright and ha registered and or ha applied to register numerous patent trademark and service mark in contrast many of the company competitor seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and low cost structure and emulating the company product and infringing it intellectual property if the company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new product with attractive margin or if competitor infringe on the company intellectual property the company ability to maintain competitive advantage could be adversely affected the company market certain mobile communication and medium device based on the io mobile operating system and also market related third party digital content and application the company face substantial competition in these market from company that have significant technical marketing distribution and other resource well established hardware software and digital content supplier relationship additionally the company face significant price competition competitor reduce their selling price and attempt to imitate the company product feature and application within their own product or alternatively collaborate with each other to offer solution that are more competitive than those they currently offer the company also competes with illegitimate way to obtain third party digital content and application the company ha entered the mobile communication and medium device market and some of it competitor in these market have greater experience product breadth and distribution channel than the company because some current and potential competitor have substantial resource and or experience and lower cost structure they may be able to provide such product and service at little or no profit or even at loss the company also expects competition to intensify competitor attempt to imitate the company approach to providing these component seamlessly within their individual offering or work collaboratively to offer integrated solution the company financial condition and operating result depend substantially on the company ability to continually improve io and io device in order to maintain their functional and design advantage the company is the only authorized maker of hardware using which ha minority market share in the personal computer market this market is dominated by computer maker using competing operating system most notably window in the market for personal computer and peripheral the company face significant number of competitor many of which have broader product line lower priced product and larger installed customer base historically consolidation in this market ha resulted in larger competitor price competition ha table of content been particularly intense competitor selling window based personal computer have aggressively cut price and lowered product margin an increasing number of internet enabled device that include software application and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computer compete for market share with the company existing product the company financial condition and operating result depend substantially on it ability to continually improve the mac platform to maintain it functional and design advantage there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to provide product and service that compete effectively to remain competitive and stimulate customer demand the company must successfully manage frequent product introduction and transition due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the industry in which the company competes the company must continually introduce new product service and technology enhance existing product and service and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded product the success of new product introduction depends on number of factor including but not limited to timely and successful product development market acceptance the company ability to manage the risk associated with new product production ramp up issue the availability of application software for new product the effective management of purchase commitment and inventory level in line with anticipated product demand the availability of product in appropriate quantity and cost to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new product may have quality or other defect in the early stage of introduction accordingly the company can not determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introduction and transition the company face substantial inventory and other asset risk in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk the company record write for product and component inventory that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value and accrues necessary cancellation fee reserve for order of excess product and component the company also review it long lived asset including capital asset held at it supplier facility for impairment whenever event or circumstance indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if the company determines that impairment ha occurred it record write down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds it fair market value although the company belief it provision related to inventory capital asset other asset and purchase commitment are currently adequate no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional related charge given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industry in which the company competes the company must order component for it product and build inventory in advance of product announcement and shipment consistent with industry practice component are normally acquired through combination of purchase order supplier contract open order and where appropriate inventory component prepayment in each case based on projected demand such purchase commitment typically cover forecasted component and manufacturing requirement for period up to day because the company market are volatile competitive and subject to rapid technology and price change there is risk the company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amount of component or product or not fully utilize firm purchase commitment future operating result depend upon the company ability to obtain component in sufficient quantity because the company currently obtains component from single or limited source the company is subject to significant supply and pricing risk many component including those that are available from multiple source are at time subject to industry wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuation while the company ha entered into various agreement for the supply of component there can be no assurance that the company will be able to extend or renew these agreement on similar term or at all the follow on effect from table of content global economic condition on the company supplier described in global economic condition could materially adversely affect the company also could affect the company ability to obtain component therefore the company remains subject to significant risk of supply shortage and price increase the company expects to experience decrease in it gross margin percentage in future period compared to level achieved during largely due to higher mix of new and innovative product with flat or reduced pricing that have higher cost structure and deliver greater value to customer and anticipated component cost and other cost increase future strengthening of the dollar could also negatively impact gross margin the company and other participant in the market for mobile communication and medium device and personal computer also compete for various component with other industry that have experienced increased demand for their product the company us some custom component that are not common to the rest of these industry the company new product often utilize custom component available from only one source when component or product us new technology initial capacity constraint may exist until the supplier yield have matured or manufacturing capacity ha increased continued availability of these component at acceptable price or at all may be affected if those supplier decided to concentrate on the production of common component instead of component customized to meet the company requirement the supply of component for new or existing product could be delayed or constrained or key manufacturing vendor could delay shipment of completed product to the company the company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical service provided by outsourcing partner many of are located outside of the substantially all of the company manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partner located primarily in asia the company ha also outsourced much of it transportation and logistics management while these arrangement may lower operating cost they also reduce the company direct control over production and distribution it is uncertain effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of product or service or the company flexibility to respond to changing condition although arrangement with these partner may contain provision for warranty expense reimbursement the company may remain responsible to the consumer for warranty service in the event of product defect and could experience an unanticipated product defect or warranty liability while the company relies on it partner to adhere to it supplier code of conduct material violation of the supplier code of conduct could occur the supply and manufacture of many critical component is performed by sole sourced outsourcing partner in the asia and europe outsourcing partner in asia perform final assembly of substantially all of the company hardware product

table of content to provide meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the company foreign currency derivative position the company performed sensitivity analysis using value at risk var model to ass the potential impact of fluctuation in exchange rate the var model consisted of using monte carlo simulation to generate thousand of random market price path assuming normal market condition the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value for given confidence interval to the company foreign currency derivative position due to adverse movement in rate the var model is not intended to represent actual loss but is used risk estimation and management tool the model assumes normal market condition forecasted transaction firm commitment and asset and liability denominated in foreign currency were excluded from the model based on the result of the model the company estimate with confidence maximum one day loss in fair value of million of september compared to maximum one day loss in fair value of million of september because the company us foreign currency instrument for hedging purpose the loss in fair value incurred on those instrument are generally offset by increase in the fair value of the underlying exposure actual future gain and loss associated with the company investment portfolio and derivative position may differ materially

product is considered delivered to the customer once it ha been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred for most of the company product sale these criterion are met at the time the product is shipped for online sale to individual for some sale to education customer in the and for certain other sale the company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because the

authority with the collected tax recorded current liability until remitted to the relevant government authority revenue recognition for arrangement with multiple deliverable for multi element arrangement that include hardware product containing software essential to the hardware product functionality undelivered software element that relate to the hardware product essential software and undelivered non software service the company allocates revenue to all deliverable based on their relative selling price in such circumstance the company us hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverable vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe ii third party evidence of selling price tpe and iii best estimate of selling price esp vsoe generally exists only when the company sell the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by the company for that deliverable esp reflect the company best estimate of what the selling price of element would be if they were sold regularly on stand alone basis for multi element arrangement accounted for in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance the company allocates revenue to all deliverable based on the vsoe of each element and if vsoe doe not exist revenue is recognized when element lacking vsoe are delivered for sale of qualifying version of iphone ipad and ipod touch io device mac and apple tv the company ha indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrade and feature to the essential software bundled with each of these hardware product free of charge to customer essential software for io device includes io and related application and for mac includes related application and ilife the company also provides various non software service to owner of qualifying version of io device and mac the company ha identified up to three deliverable regularly included in arrangement involving the sale of these device the first deliverable is the hardware and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale the second deliverable is the embedded right included with the purchase of io device mac and apple tv to receive on when and if available basis future unspecified software upgrade and feature relating to the product essential software the third deliverable is the non software service to be provided to qualifying version of io device and mac the company allocates revenue between table of content these deliverable using the relative selling price method because the company ha neither vsoe nor tpe for these deliverable the allocation of revenue is based on the company esp revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software is recognized at the time of sale provided the other condition for revenue recognition have been met revenue allocated to the embedded unspecified software upgrade right and the non software service is deferred and recognized on straight line basis over the estimated period the software upgrade and non software service are expected to be provided for each of these device which range from two to four year cost of sale related to delivered hardware and related essential software including estimated warranty cost are recognized at the time of sale cost incurred to provide non software service are recognized cost of sale incurred and engineering and sale and marketing cost are recognized operating expense incurred the company process for determining it esp for deliverable without vsoe or tpe considers multiple factor that may vary depending upon the unique fact and circumstance related to each deliverable the company belief it customer would be reluctant to buy unspecified software upgrade right for the essential software included with it qualifying hardware product this view is primarily based on the fact that unspecified software upgrade right do not obligate the company to provide upgrade at particular time or at all and do not specify to customer which upgrade or feature will be delivered the company also belief it customer would be unwilling to pay significant amount for access to the non software service because other company offer similar service at little or no cost to user therefore the company ha concluded that if it were to sell upgrade right or access to the non software service on standalone basis including those right and service attached to io device mac and apple tv the selling price would be relatively low key factor considered by the company in developing the esp for software upgrade right include price charged by the company for similar offering market trend in the pricing of apple branded and third party mac and io compatible software the nature of the upgrade right unspecified versus specified and the relative esp of the upgrade right compared to the total selling price of the product the company may also consider additional factor appropriate including the impact of other product and service provided to customer the pricing of competitive alternative if they exist product specific business objective and the length of time particular version of device ha been available when relevant the same factor are considered by the company in developing esp for offering such the non software service however the primary consideration in developing esp for the non software service is the estimated cost to provide such service including consideration for reasonable profit margin for the three year ended september the company combined esp for the unspecified software upgrade right and the right to receive the non software service included with it qualifying hardware device have ranged from to revenue allocated to such right included with io device and apple tv is recognized on straight line basis over two year and revenue allocated to such right included with mac is recognized on straight line basis over four year shipping cost for all period presented amount billed to customer related to shipping and handling are classified revenue and the company shipping and handling cost are included in cost of sale

by the taxing authority based on the technical merit of the position the tax benefit recognized in the financial statement from such position are then measured based on the largest benefit that ha greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement see note income tax of this form for additional information earnings per share basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income

market participant at the measurement date when determining the fair value measurement for asset and liability which are required to be recorded at fair value the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the company would transact and the market based risk measurement or assumption that market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability such risk inherent in valuation technique transfer restriction and credit risk fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy which prioritizes the input used to measure fair value into three level and base the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement level quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability level observable input other than quoted price in active market for identical asset and liability quoted price for identical or similar asset or liability in inactive market or other input
