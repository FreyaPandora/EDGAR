of the net deferred tax asset are not realizable in the future the company will record an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is

accrual with respect to loss contingency for asserted legal and other claim however the outcome of legal proceeding and claim brought against the company is subject to significant uncertainty therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matter were resolved against the company in reporting period for amount in excess
